Operator : Ladies and Gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the Public Storage First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Clem Teng. Please go ahead sir. Clemente Teng : Good morning.

You can find our press release, SEC reports and audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Ron. Ronald L. Havner: Good morning and thanks Clem. We had another solid quarter; our fundamentals to the self-storage business I have to say are pretty good. During Q1, we had higher movements at higher movement rates instead less to acquire the customers which are staying longer. Further, new supply in our industry is nominal and this makes for an ideal operating environment. Now with that operator, lets open up for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Hey, Ron good morning. Ronald L. Havner: Good morning. Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Investment Bank, Research Division :  Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing on the rate side, your realized rate growth has sort of being hovering here in the 4 to 4.3% range for the last three quarters. So just a little more color on the traction you are getting in terms of being able to start pushing rate higher now that your occupancy comps hit the wall probably the summer? Edward John Reyes : : As we moved into people, we continue to push Street rates and a move-in volume was about flat for the month of April, but the take rate goes up about 6%. Again, it was probably discounting. As we move forward, I think we\u2019ll continue to try to push Street rates, but the Street rates are currently up about 6% to 7%. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get a lot of traction on reducing discounts further. Our standalone strategy right now is to continue to push Street rates and I don\u2019t think they can be both at the same time. So we\u2019ll see how that goes as we move into you know a really busy month which are May and June, and see how well we can consider to keep or hold our occupancies with ahead of Street rates. : As we moved into people, we continue to push Street rates and a move-in volume was about flat for the month of April, but the take rate goes up about 6%.

Operator :  The next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Landon Park \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, this is Landon on for Vikram. I just had a quick question on you know the occupancy gain that we saw in the first quarter, on the 70 basis point magnitude. Is that something that you think that we could continue to see for the rest of the year or is that magnitude you know trail off in the higher \u2013 in the high season? Ronald L. Havner: Hi, Vikram this is Ron. I\u2019ll let John amplify that you know for Landon. In April, end of April our occupancies were 93.9 versus 92.9 last year, so up about full 100 bips year-over-year on same-store pool. But as we go into May and June consistent with last year, which we have no reason to believe it won\u2019t be. We\u2019ll kind of get sold out, so we\u2019ll peak out at 95%-95.5% occupancy in the system. Landon Park \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. And then just moving to expenses, I know there was obviously excess snow removal cost in the quarter, but was there anything one-time other than that in the quarter or excess \u2013 or ex the snow removal, is that sort of the rate that we should expect to see going forward? Ronald L. Havner: Overall expenses if you take out the weather-related cost both on the snow removal and the utilities, I think our expenses were pretty flat. And going into \u2013 you know, property taxes were up to 4% to 5%, I think payroll is up 1% to 2%. So we think those trends will continue into the balance of the year. In Q2, we expect about $0.5 million less on advertising, but other than that, most everything should trend at least at this time to what we see in Q1. Landon Park \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So that flat growth you think can continue. Ronald L. Havner: Well, I think we benefitted in Q1 from lower advertising and we\u2019re only going to get about 0.5 million up on that in Q2. So the other stuff that you see, you know, the payroll, the property taxes, management, those will trend about the same as Q1. Landon Park \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. Thank you very much for the clarification. That\u2019s all I have. Ronald L. Havner: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Hey, it\u2019s Jordan Sadler here with Todd. Wanted to just follow up on the total revenue growth potential. It seems like the street rates is \u2013 you\u2019re getting real nice traction, up 6% to 7%, I think you said John. If you sort of layer in a little bit of occupancy and a little bit of reduced discounting on a year-over-year basis, I know you\u2019re not necessarily going to try and drive it further \u2013 or down further through the rest of the year, but are we looking at a 10-percentish type REVPAF potential growth? Edward John Reyes : In our same store department? Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Yeah. Edward John Reyes : Not at all. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Not at all. Edward John Reyes : No. The piece of the equation that I think you missed is the move-outs. The move-out volume has picked up a little bit versus last year and they\u2019re moving out at higher rates, rental rates. And the reason why that\u2019s happening is because we\u2019ve been aggressive about pushing rates to existing tenants and other time obviously they\u2019ve gapped up quite a bit. And now when they\u2019re moving out, not that they\u2019re moving out any faster than they were before, but when they do move out, they\u2019re taking with them higher rental rates with them. So as we\u2019re moving people in, even though they\u2019re coming in at 6% higher year-over-year rates on the moving inside, they\u2019re moving out at higher rates than their move-in rates. So for every move-in that we replaced \u2013 or every move-out that we replaced with a move-in, we actually rent rolled down. And we have been rent rolling down for quite a number of quarters now, for at least about I would say three years or so. So there is leakage. So although mathematically what you said may work, the leakage brings it back down quite a bit. Ronald L. Havner: But moving (indiscernible) rates, Jordon, narrows that gap between the rent roll, between the move-outs and the move-ins, so that\u2019s a positive in that regard. The other thing that I would add to what John said is, you know, I touched on customers are staying longer, 56% of our customer base has been here over a year, that\u2019s a pretty low churn part of the portfolio. So those customers will give rental rate increases consistent with last year, but they\u2019re not going to be changing based on changes in street rates. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. Have the roll-downs changed at all as you started to push street rate here in April? Are we looking at 3% mark-to-market when you \u2013 in terms of the roll-down as replacing and move-out? Edward John Reyes : Well, the roll-down has changed a little bit but just really recently because \u2013 just recently have we really been pushing the street rates in this month in April, because as I mentioned during the first quarter, the move in rate was up about 3% whereas in April it was up about \u2013 a little over 6%. So it\u2019s just recently that we\u2019ve really maybe narrowed that market \u2013 that spread \u2013 that year-over-year spread. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Edward John Reyes : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citigroup. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Inc.: Hey, good morning to you guys. Ron, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about your view of the acquisitions environment and what sort of opportunities you\u2019re seeing out there currently and what are your efforts internally in terms of trying to source deals? Ronald L. Havner: Well, our efforts in terms of sourcing deals are consistent with what we\u2019ve always had. We\u2019ve had a couple of people that do focus on acquisitions. They\u2019re very experienced people and they\u2019re pretty much in the flow of everything going on. So that hasn\u2019t changed at all. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing, I think I touched on last quarter that the price that we\u2019re seeing is of lesser quality than we saw last year. That continues to be the case. Although I will say that there\u2019s been an uptrend in terms of quality coming to the market, which is probably not unusual given \u2013 you know, it takes people time to decide and get product out on to the market. So the quality is up taking a little bit but it\u2019s still overall I\u2019ll say lesser than last year. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Inc.: Then in Europe, you\u2019ve had some nice traction there in terms of turning revenue into high growth positive, occupancies are up or rents are down. How are you approaching revenue management in the region? In the environment there are some orders as sort of few years ago in the US early stages of recovery? Ronald L. Havner: You know Christy that\u2019s a very good information. Last year, second half of the year we\u2019ve started tag differently in Europe with much more aggressive asking rate, rental reductions something that we have experimented with here in the US we applied over there first month 50% off. We tried it in a couple Markets in September. It really worked, we did it again in November and again in March and as you touched on, you\u2019ve seen a nice uptick in occupancies. At the end of the quarter, we were 86.1 in Europe versus 79.5, so it\u2019s over 600 basis points year-over-year uptick in occupancy. At \u2013 offsetting that was a reduction in place rents of about 5%. But our goal over there it\u2019s the same similar to US gets a portfolio up there, over there to the low to mid 90s occupancy. And so, we\u2019ll continue with that pricing strategy until we get the portfolio stabilized at a higher rate. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan [Burge] of Green Street Advisors. Unidentified Analyst : Hi just hoping for an update on the preferred market in particular the March offering was sizeable, but the April offering was pretty small. So did you get smaller on that lateral offering just simply based on your immediate capital needs or is there something that you foresee plan out in the preferred market over the rest of the year? Ronald L. Havner: Well the April offering that we did was really re-opening of our series wide preferred. We had an interest move a single institutional investor to who was interested in taking down about 50 million of our existing serried [wire] so we went ahead and consummated that transaction. So that wasn\u2019t marketed by any means. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Ronald L. Havner: In terms of the preferred market, I think its\u2019 firming up, it\u2019s getting better. Our existing preferred out there are trading well. We are hoping to get better obviously and I wouldn\u2019t put it half this, I\u2019m trying to go out into the market sometime during Q2, Q3 and test it again and see what we can raise you know if the markets are there for us. We still have about 320 million on our bank term loan that we need to deal with before it matures in December of this year; I mean that would be one way that we would think about repaying the rest of it. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you and then question looking at the back page of the supplemental on the 2012 acquisition break out. On my numbers the NOI you give there implies that you are getting a yield on cost in those assets north of 7% that\u2019s on assets that are 86% occupied. I believe that the 2011 acquisition bucket ended up north of the 10% yield. Just curious if you can give us your thoughts on you know what we should, how we should think about the yields moving forward on the 2012 and \u201913 buckets? Ronald L. Havner: Well -- the [12] you are right exclusive close to 7% on the occupancy sell out room for occupancy growth. We start moving for rate growth. One of the things that we do when we acquire properties as we get very conservative on the rates, so we can fill up the properties rather quickly and then as they are getting to you know a stabilized occupancy level then we start being aggressive on increasing rental rates to the existing tenant base and we really haven\u2019t been aggressive on the 2012 and 2013 acquisition tenant base, but we plan on starting to do that this year. So, I think in both portfolios whether it be the 20, the 2012 or the 2013 we have both occupancy gains to be had there as well as increasing the existing tenant base prior rental rates. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you, that\u2019s all from me. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JP Morgan Michael W. Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan : Yeah, hi looking at the development, what do you see in terms of the pace of lease up compared to like what you typically underwrite for and just kind of what the experience was during the last cycle due for the downturn? Ronald L. Havner :  Well Mike, you know that the last cycle before a downturns \u201905, \u201906,\u201907 we didn\u2019t have much in the development pipeline during that period of time. So I really can\u2019t kind of comment on how this would compare to that time. I could tell you on the step that we\u2019re opening it is filling up faster that we anticipated. But as John just touched on when we opened new developments or acquired properties that are you know lower at occupancy levels lower than what we view as stabilized, we\u2019re a little more aggressive on rental rates until they achieved stabilization. You know and a good example is our Bronx Gerard property that ended April at 67% occupied, not even open, a year or so it\u2019s got 3000 plus units leased up, but those are at rates about 60% or 70% of what we\u2019ve forecast. So we\u2019re filling up much faster but we\u2019re doing with more aggressive rental rates. Michael W. Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan : Got it, okay. And one follow-up, on G&A, it was about 18 million this quarter. Can you talk about was there anything impacting that that was one-time in nature and what do you expect for the balance of the year? Edward John Reyes : Mike, there wasn\u2019t anything in there that was really one-time in G&A. As for the balance of the year, you know, I think we\u2019re going to be relatively consistent with last year and I caveat that with it will depend on our acquisition volumes going forward because a lot of the acquisition costs do get expensed through G&A. So depending on how much acquisitions we do, that could change it quite a bit one way or another. Michael W. Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan : And excluding those acquisition costs, you think it will be comparable year-over-year as well? Edward John Reyes : As far as we can tell right now, we don\u2019t see anything right now that would cause us to believe that it could be either significantly higher or lower. Michael W. Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon everyone. I may have missed this, but Ron, your comments earlier on about the roll-down in the rents when you \u2013 an old tenant \u2013 when a current tenant moves out. I\u2019m just kind of curious, could you just give us a sense of what that average rent is versus what street rents are, so we can get a sense of what that roll-down is? Ronald L. Havner: Tayo, I think \u2013 and John can elaborate this, that will be in the 10Q and so you can compare it, you know what it was last year, what it was this year and obviously it varies by market. Edward John Reyes : Let me give you some numbers. I\u2019m not sure to what degree it\u2019s actually disclosed in our 10Q, but it\u2019s disclosed on a square foot basis actually in our 10Q. I\u2019m going to give it to you on a unit basis or a move-in basis, so during the first quarter of this year, for example, the average move-in rate in our same store was about $114 per move-in. The move-out rate during that same period of time was about $123, and so it\u2019s about $10 swing \u2013 negative swing. Last year it was \u2013 the move-in rate was about $111 versus a move-out rate of $119. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, there. Edward John Reyes : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin of RBC. Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Hey, gentlemen, good morning. My question is, given the strength in storage, have you guys seen opportunities or are you going to look at opportunities with private developers to take out their development CO buyout as it were. I just \u2013 you\u2019ve been looking at this theme come to the market more. Edward John Reyes : Mike, we\u2019re seeing and hearing about people doing that and \u2013 but we\u2019re not doing that ourselves. We\u2019ve engaged some \u2013 we\u2019ve got some local guys helping us develop in certain markets but for the most part we\u2019ve got our own team building our property. And it\u2019s not to say we wouldn\u2019t do that at a C of O. Last year, we acquired some properties in Boston, one newly C of O and then one that was still under development. So we have done that. I wouldn\u2019t rule it out, but that\u2019s really not how we\u2019re undertaking our development program. Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Got it, got it. Okay, next question, clearly the Public guys have been very successful at increasing demand \u2013 you know, occupancies have been continuing to go up and almost at record levels. Do you think that\u2019s from paradigm shift sort of to people using mobile or online to get rate or deals that a mom-and-pop couldn\u2019t provide. Do you think that\u2019s definitely helped you or is that just an extra gravy for you guys? Ronald L. Havner: Well, I think the ability of the larger operators to place themselves in better rankings on either the desktop or mobile is very helpful, in the sense that more and more people are using the internet or mobile to access the information on top storage rentals. I could tell you that as we\u2019ve tracked it internally, last year \u2013 during the first quarter of last year, roughly 51% of our move-ins came through an internet channel. And that compares to this year, where it\u2019s now 58%. So it continues to increase as people are using internet and mobile. Mobile has been rising quite a bit, and it\u2019s certainly helpful to be a big player because you can get \u2013 you could afford to buy your way into placement as well as have the relevancy to place well on desktop and match one and local maps, suit yourself. So yeah, it\u2019s managed to be a large operator in self storage. Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Thank you and finally and assume the commentaries about the roll down. You know you guys are pushing Street rates pretty aggressively which is great. But, you know the renewals on average are 2% to 3% higher than Street rates. Are you worried at all because from the higher maintained occupancy and lower churns that overtime that in fact will be compounded and the roll downs will continue and exacerbate the retarding of revenue growth? Thanks. Edward John Reyes : That\u2019s alright. That\u2019s been happening for years now. We have talked about the rent roll down has been going on. And it\u2019s largely because there is a dynamic that the mark-to-market is actually a negative number and has been for quite sometime. So, our existing tenant base is if you look at it on average is paying more than our market rates are. And that\u2019s its you know a testament to how sticky people are and you can continue to head in what their increase is and not withstanding the fact that they could be you know obtain 10, 15% above market, they still stay. The difficulty is when they moved out, when they move out though, however we have the immediate roll down as we replace them. Ronald L. Havner: You know Mike, to further John\u2019s point they don\u2019t have this on a per square foot basis. But if you look at our average move-in rates over the last six or eight years, in 2007, 2008 customers were moving it about $123, $124. Q4 they were moving into the $114. So while the rates, the 114 starts year-over-year as John went through. They are still you know call it $10 a month longer than where they work in \u201907,\u201908. Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes form the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS: Hey guys couple of follow up. First, where do you think your Street rates are today versus your closest competition? Ronald L. Havner: It depends Ross. We track it by market, by property, so it really depnds I think overall in the system, we are probably a little bit above competition for the most part and in probably most markets that we operate in. Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS:  Second question would be just to confirm, I think last year you were bumping around 10 existing customers probably number was like around 8% or 9%, is that still the case? Ronald L. Havner: Yes, it\u2019s pretty much the same this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Ronald L. Havner: Hi, Paula. Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: I got a big picture question on the acquisition market, Ron. I think that some of us tend to have a tendency to forget just how fragmented this industry continues to be. On the private side, what do you think the number of truly large but institutional quality portfolios exist that maybe just still in the hands of reluctant sellers? Ronald L. Havner: Paula, you know our best guess, I\u2019ve got David down here with me and \u2013 we\u2019ve looked at that in a number of markets. And my guess is less than 20. Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Thanks, Ron. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Quick question on -- the number of customers that you plan to send out rent increases to in the summer time. I think the last time it was about 55% any change in that number that you are planning for this year? Edward John Reyes : Well I took up the same key just to look maybe a little bit more because the ageing as Ron pointed out earlier; we have a better ace, kind of base in other words. So if we have more customers that meet the criteria, so we\u2019ll probably give out in terms of number the volume, slightly more than last year. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And final question for me, the number of customers we seen in promotions, I know you guys get asked that once in awhile. Any update on where it is today versus last year in the same period? Edward John Reyes : No its\u2019 about roughly about 80% of the move-in volumes we see some sort of a promotion in the full blown dollar for the first month or 50% off. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay, alright thank you. Ronald L. Havner: You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.: Hey it\u2019s Jordan Sadler for Todd here again. I just on the acquisition side, its rumored that there is a sizeable portfolio out there for sale. We\u2019re just talking about 20 or so or less that remain after that that are of institutional quality. Is there anything sort of on your radar right now that\u2019s for sale? Ronald L. Havner: Oh Jordan, there is always stuff on our radar both stuff that\u2019s -- in the market and being marketed as well as stuff that\u2019s not or being marketed. Three of our largest transactions, our largest transactions or two of these transactions last year had no packages no broker involved. So we\u2019re in dialogue, with you know we know the call it 20 or so people as well as people are grouped to people\u2019s institutions or \u2013 operators have you know aren\u2019t in the big group all the time. So, so there\u2019s always stuff on our radar. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.: Always of course. I guess another way of sort of slicing it, I\u2019m curious about sort of maybe your \u2013 you know, how you see the competitive set in terms of capital today. I mean, are you able to get deals done here given your sort of discipline on the underwriting still? Ronald L. Havner: Why, I think, you can look in Q4 last year where we took down around 700 million in the fourth quarter. Are we able to get deals? Yes. Is it competitive? Yes. Stabilized properties are a challenge, especially one and two ops because there\u2019s \u2013 to your point, there\u2019s plenty of financing where there is CMBS, bank financing or public market financing. So where money is cheap, assets are expensive. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.: Is there any change on the underwriting side, meaning I know that you\u2019ve historically been a replacement cost buyer but is there \u2013 are replacement costs moving up or is your view of replacement costs moving up materially or do you attribute value to in place customers and cash flow to a greater extent today than before? Ronald L. Havner: Well, that\u2019s a lot of questions but I\u2019ll try to answer it. A property that\u2019s stabilized with an existing customer base is worth more than one that has to go through three years or so of fill-up, not only because you don\u2019t have the fill-up risk but generally the customer base is mature and more stable. And therefore is more susceptible promptly to rental \u2013 annual rental rate increases whereas a property that is in fill-up, it\u2019s going to be much more challenging and there\u2019s obviously fewer customers to send out rental rate increases to for property that\u2019s in fill-up than one that\u2019s stabilized. So, yes, stabilized acquisitions are worth more per se than development. I think I touched on before in terms of our view \u2013 my view of replacement cost, and I kind of went through this in this year\u2019s shareholders letter. In a market like Reno, Nevada where there is lots of land and abundance of product and low population density with lower incomes, those are properties that we would acquire but we want to do them at substantial discounts to replacement costs, about 50% or 60%. You can track that to lower Manhattan where there is higher incomes, very little competition, great density of people and you know, we\u2019d be willing to pay 175% of replacement cost because the huge barriers to entries and the great customer aspects of that market. So it just depends on the particular market. Does that address your question? Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.: Yeah, I appreciate your flushing it out, gave me an opportunity to advertise the letter. I\u2019m going to have to go back and read it again. Ronald L. Havner: Okay. Thanks. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets.: Thanks. Operator : At this time there are no further questions, I\u2019ll now return the call to Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clemente Teng : Yes. I just wanted to mention that JP Morgan will be hosting a tour of our 4000 unit Gerard facility in the Bronx. The tour would take place on Monday, June 2nd, the day prior to the Navy conference in New York City. So with that, I just want to appreciate everybody questions this morning and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Public Storage first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Public Storage\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Clem Teng. Please go ahead. Clemente Teng : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call.

You can find our press release, SEC reports and audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ron. Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem, and welcome everyone. We had another solid quarter. Our fundamentals to the self-storage business continue to be excellent. With that operator, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Good morning guys. Could you just talk a little bit more about kind of your future longer term capital deployment plans, especially as it relates to development, you have about $240 million today. What is the longer term dollar value that you feel comfortable with? Ron Havner : Well Ki, this is Ron. Is your question, how big do we expect the pipeline to grow in terms of \u2013 because it was like, I think $1,590 [ph] million to being the year and it\u2019s now $240 million. Is that your question? Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Yes. Ron Havner : Yes. Well, I think we\u2019re trying to get it up to about $300 million to $350 million. Keep in mind that most of our projects is $7 million to $8 million. And it takes \u2013 we have to go through three or four properties to get one kind of into the pipeline. So that\u2019s a lot of projects when you get to $300 million, $350 million. If we get there and feel good about it, we could take it to $400 million. That would be fine if the market is there and our processes are in place to achieve that level of production. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And just a follow-up to that. So let\u2019s say, call it $350 million, how much visibility do you have in terms of, let\u2019s say next year when you try and start $350 million or get to that in terms of which market can support it, should you do it, those type of questions. Ron Havner : Well, we have a number of people in the development group that are looking at sites in certain identified key markets. And so part of our development activities is first being able to find the appropriate sites, get the right zoning and being able to develop and conceive a project that actually kind of makes the economic sense to us, both in terms of rate of return but also where it fits into the portfolio. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Jeremy Metz \u2013 UBS: Hi, good morning. Jeremy Metz on with Ross. Can you just talk about where your net rents, net of discounts where they were from move-ins this quarter versus move-outs, and kind of how that spread compared to the last year. Are they getting wider or narrowing? John Reyes : Yes, Jeremy, this is John. So move-ins were coming in at a monthly rate of about $121.97 on average. The move-outs were leaving at an average rate of about $124. So there is a net negative spread there of about $2.03. On the move-in side in terms of the discount side, roughly \u2013 we gave away roughly $20 million of discounts. That was the same \u2013 this is during the quarter and that was the same as last year. For the last year in the same quarter, move-ins were coming in at $114.20 and they were vacating at $119.70. So that was a negative spread of $5.50. So the spreads obviously narrowed, but nonetheless it\u2019s still a negative spread, rent roll down. Jeremy Metz \u2013 UBS: Okay. And then just in terms of the discount, for the 5.3% revenue growth this quarter that you\u2019ve put out. Just how much of that was your ability to squeeze discounts, and as you look out at the back half of this year, can you squeeze discounts even more from here or is that kind of leveling off at this point? John Reyes : Jeremy, the discounts were about $20 million in both quarters for the second quarter of this year. Notwithstanding the fact we\u2019re actually giving away, and in terms of the absolute number less discounts, the dollar value of those discounts is more because the rental rates are higher. Folks are moving in at about 7% higher rates during the quarter than they were last year. So even though, notwithstanding the fact again that we gave away less discounts on a per move-in, the absolute dollars was flat because of the rental rate being up 7%. Going forward, I think the discounts would probably be fairly consistent with last year, probably pretty flat. Jeremy Metz \u2013 UBS: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup: Just sort of a follow-up on Ki Bin\u2019s question. Ron, you\u2019ve been rebuilding your ground-up development platform for a couple of years now. Now that you\u2019re a year or two into doing projects, are the returns looking better or worse than when you originally fed out, are you thinking about any changes to the process or in doing projects on balance sheet versus with the partner? Some of your REIT peers have been increasingly buying those deals to get some development exposure. Just hoping to get your current thoughts of your approach development to that? Ron Havner : That\u2019s a lot of questions, Christy. Our development program, I would say we initiated it probably two, 2.5 years ago. It continues to grow. The team is not yet quite complete. Our processes are somewhat evolving, and what we\u2019re finding in the market, we\u2019re having to adapt to different things in the marketplace. In terms of returns, and are we achieving the yields that we thought. In our business it takes six months to find a site, six to 12 months to build it, and generally two to three years to fill it. So it would be a couple of years before we absolutely know whether we achieved our targeted yields, but so far most of the properties are filling up faster than we anticipated, although in some cases lower than pro forma risk as we trying to accelerate the fill up, where we\u2019re building it pretty close to on-time, pretty close to on-budge. We haven\u2019t had any big hiccups. So I am feeling really good about our development activities at this juncture. In terms of other people buying CFOs [ph] or partially completed properties, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before that we anticipated that. Some have been rather vocal about not wanting the development program, but you can do development in variety of ways and one of them is just buy CFO [ph] building. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup: And how do you think about doing projects with a partner versus on your own? Ron Havner : We\u2019re fine with that. It\u2019s really a cost to capital analysis. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America : Good afternoon. Thanks for the time. Can you comment on supply tracking in your markets today versus, let\u2019s say, a year ago? Ron Havner : Jeff, we don\u2019t have any stats here by market. I can\u2019t tell you \u2013 as I said before that development is much more of a conversation today. There are people developing in a number of markets. Is it significant relative to the existing base? No. But it\u2019s accelerating, and I would expect it to continue to accelerate over the next year or two. Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America : Okay, thanks Ron. And then quick question on occupancy, yet another nice quarter of occupancy growth. How are you thinking about occupancy against how high you can get it versus pushing rents? What are your latest thoughts there on that balance? John Reyes : Well, we\u2019re going to continue to push rents as we\u2019ve talked about. In terms of occupancy, we mentioned that it\u2019s going to get tougher and tougher to move the occupancy spread, which you see that during the quarter that spread has narrowed quite a bit. It\u2019s gapped out a little bit by the end of July. What I am hoping to try to accomplish with our portfolio is to see if during the fourth quarter, we can gap it out a little bit more by maybe doing a little more advertising on television and seeing if we can get some traction and flatten out the occupancy curve during the first \u2013 the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2015. Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks. I want to just touch on Europe, you\u2019ve had a couple of quarters of improving occupancy. Just want to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing there and could we expect at some point rents to start increasing there as well? Ron Havner : Well, we\u2019ve gotten some positive traction here in Europe starting in Q3 of last year where we changed our pricing strategy there and done some pretty aggressive promotional programs. And that seems to have worked both in the Q4 last year and into this year, which you see reflected in the occupancy is up about 7% year-over-year. And that\u2019s pretty much across the entire platform. Even Holland is up from 74.2% from 69.2% last year. At this juncture \u2013 and we\u2019re doing that at the expense of rolling down rents. So if you look at the table, you see that the in-place rents are rolling down. I would expect that program to continue for the foreseeable future until we get the portfolio at a much higher stabilized occupancy levels, say in the low 90s and drive volumes with promotional discounts. Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with Keybanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : It\u2019s Jordan Sadler with Todd. 95% occupancy, stunning. How is it even possible? I guess I\u2019m just trying to think of the frictional vacancy and just maybe I don\u2019t think if I asked you guys if you could get the 95% occupancy six months ago even or a year ago, that would have said, yes, no problem. Are you doing anything differently, anything you could sort of shed some light on? Ron Havner : Jordan, this is Ron. I\u2019ll analogize this to flying a plane. It\u2019s one thing to take a low level plane and kind of operate at 85. It\u2019s another for a jet at 90. And when you get into the 95, think of it more as like an astronaut. So you\u2019ve got to operate a little differently and your inventory systems has to be little different, your pricing has to be a little different. And so we continue to push it here. And if we can get it to 96%, we love to do that. Right now as John said, we\u2019re trying to take some of the seasonality out of the business, both in Q1 and Q4 of this year. And I think that will be a good achievement in and of itself. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : And where were you at the end of July? Ron Havner : We were at 94.8%. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : Okay. John Reyes : About at the same level essentially. We do expect \u2013 I mean as we get into the back half of the year, you lose a little bit but try to retain as much as possible. Ron Havner : Well after June, Jordan \u2013 and you know this because you\u2019re following the industry now for a long time. After June, it\u2019s net move-out for the balance of the year. So in July, we had net move-outs of 4,200 customers versus about 6,000 last year. So while our occupancy was 94.8% that\u2019s up from 94.4% in the prior year. So we do have better in July, both on the move-ins and the move-outside than we did last year. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : Thank you. And then Just a quick follow-up. Little bigger picture on the aggregators that are out there. You guys have had the larger players in the space, public players have this big competitive advantage of teams. I am just curious as to your thoughts in terms of the ability of these aggregators out there to sort of help out the little guys and sort of close the gap, if you will, in terms of that relative advantage. You think that\u2019s a year out, two years out or never? John Reyes : Jordan, this is John. I think the aggregators had in fact helped the little guys improve probably on their occupancies and their ability to get visibility on the internet. So I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know, whether it\u2019s economically benefit to the little guys, I think it has benefited their ability to get with the volumes. So I think it\u2019s a positive for them. For us, we would rather than not be there than be there, all things being equal, but they are there and we deal with them and we compete with them when we\u2019re bidding for search terms, which again I\u2019d rather not be competing with them, but there we have to compete with them. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan : Yes, hi. I was wondering if you can comment on the properties you bought, not necessarily in second quarter but in July, that $240 million, and where is occupancy, where did they come from, etcetera? Ron Havner : Well, they were principally one portfolio, Mike. And they were in, let\u2019s see, in D.C., Orlando, Tampa, Sarasota, Fort Myers, and then various other submarkets across Florida and New Jersey and North Carolina. I think their occupancy at the end of July was about 92% and that ranged from a high of, let\u2019s see, 96.9% for one property down to one that was at 68.8%. So this would kind of validate something I have said for a long time is if you have good properties and a good manager, you\u2019ll do just fine in this business. These properties were operated with a variety of different names, no internet marketing, no brand name, and yet we had a number of properties that 96% plus occupancy. So really good quality real estate. Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan : I mean it seems like when you typically buy stuff in the past, the occupancy is lower and that\u2019s part of the play. Occupancy is clearly higher on this one, it\u2019s because there is something just in terms of rate that\u2019s compelling or something else? Ron Havner : Well, Florida [ph] \u2013 so my guess is we\u2019ll probably end up doing a little better on expenses, maybe a little better on pricing and there is some properties in here with some occupancy opportunities as well. Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay, thanks. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Burke with Green Street Advisors. Ryan Burke \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Thank you. A follow-up Jordan\u2019s question earlier. Can you just provide some more detail on how operating a property that is 95% occupied might be fundamentally different in some ways than operating properties let\u2019s say 85% or below that? Ron Havner : Ryan, this is Ron. There is a variety of things and I\u2019d rather not do that, because from a competitive standpoint this is really not the forum to get into that kind of discussion. Ryan Burke \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay, understood. Thank you. Second question, you achieved a pretty nice increase in the yields on your 2012 acquisition bucket year-over-year. It\u2019s been a fantastic operating environment over that time period, both new supply and the affect of aggregators that we mentioned on the call so far, but looking forward from where we stand right now, stay over the two or three years, is there anything that you see that might fundamentally change in the sector, whether it be for better or worse? Ron Havner : I\u2019m not sure \u2013 in terms of two to three years, that\u2019s a long time, and I am not really capable of forecasting out that far. I would say right now the fundamentals are very good. I think the \u2013 I don\u2019t know if all the public companies have reported, but certainly the ones that have, have demonstrated strong fundamentals. Certainly our same store properties demonstrates strong fundamental. There is development going on in the marketplace. We\u2019re developing, other people are developing. So supply is on the uptick. So when you kind of look at the big picture of the industry from where it was four years ago, rates are higher, occupancy is higher and development is starting. So kind of the risk of the industry is probably a little greater today than it was four years ago, but I think we\u2019ve probably have at least another year or two of great fundamentals for this business. Ryan Burke \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co: Yes, good afternoon. Just two quick questions from me. The first one just along the line of the aggregators that are now moving into the sector. Just wondering, does it make sense \u2013 again as you guys being the largest player in the market to try to take on that rule or kind of build up a third-party asset management business like some of your peers, or when you look at the economics of that business, you just don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it? Ron Havner : Tayo, this is Ron. I think one of the really distinguishing features of our Public Storage vis-\u00e0-vis the other operators and the aggregators is branding. We get a fair amount of our \u2013 70% of our searches are organic. That means someone is punching in Public Storage, and so we don\u2019t pay for that. And I am pretty confident no one is even close to that number in terms of organic searches. And when 70% or 80% of the business is coming through the web and another 70% or 80% of that is organic for us, we are just in a much different place than the other operators in the industry that really don\u2019t have a brand name. Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co: Okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then the second question is with the ramp-up on the ground-up development, just curious if that\u2019s a commentary on you feeling less bullish on the acquisition side of the business, or you really kind of see good opportunities for external growth both from development and acquisitions? Ron Havner : The second. Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co: Okay, the second. Great. Thank you very much. Great quarter. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Suntrust. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey : Thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Could you give the \u2013 you guys typically give the comp promotions stat, what was in the second quarter in terms of number of customers receiving a promotion? And I guess you typically give it in percentage terms, the decline in the amount of promotion dollars? John Reyes : Ki, I think \u2013 this is just off the top of my head. I think we gave away about roughly 65% of our move-ins received some sort of a promotion. And remember our promotions could be 50% off the first month or a $1 for the first month. And then last year I think it was roughly around 70-ish or something like that. Ron Havner : Dollar amount, Ki, John mentioned earlier is about the same, $20 million to $20 million. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And\u2026 Ron Havner : But the rates were up 7% so that would tell you \u2013 rates were up 7% on that, that the number of customers must be down where the dollar \u2013 the percent of actual dollars we\u2019re giving away in terms of 50% versus the dollar would be down 7% to offset that. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey : And just second question. Your payroll costs declined 4% on your same store portfolio. Just curious what you did there? Ron Havner : We\u2019ve done some things in terms of labor management to help improve the productivity of field operations. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey : So which is basically less hours to pay for? Ron Havner : Fewer hours, yes. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey : Yes. Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with Keybanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : Hi, it\u2019s Jordan again. I just wanted to come back to the acquisition question. It sounds like there is some opportunities. With Europe turning around as sharply as it is now operationally, is that on the radar again, maybe views on sort of incremental investment there? Ron Havner : Yes, Jordan, I wish there were more acquisition opportunities in Europe of the products that we like. It\u2019s pretty slim pick-ins in large measure because the industry size over there is far smaller than the U.S. Recall, Europe has probably 1,500 facilities, and I think 800 or 900 of them are in Great Britain. In the Great Britain, we\u2019re not really interested in too much product outside of the London and the M25. And there is a lot of product outside there in kind of country-side that we have no interest to it. When you get into continent, there is not a lot of property portfolios that are interest to us. Couple and we\u2019re in contact with those people. If we could do something we probably do that especially since we\u2019ve kind of got the finances in the balance sheet in Europe fixed. My longer term expectation is that in Europe it\u2019s more of a development play. And so we\u2019re looking to undertake some development there, mainly in London. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : So you\u2019ve started to invest in the development platform in London again? Ron Havner : Yes. Jordan Sadler \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Ron Havner : Thank you, Jordan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup: Yes, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. I just had a follow-up. In terms of the occupancy, what\u2019s that standard? You have 2,000 facilities, how clustered are those around the 95%? So I don\u2019t know if you can maybe put them into some groupings in terms of \u2013 there are certain amount of facilities that are running much higher that, call it 97%, 98% or even up the full which is kind of nutty, but maybe you do have some. And then how far down to go and what that bucket is? John Reyes : Hi Jordan, this is John. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup: It\u2019s Bilerman. John Reyes : Sorry Michael. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup: I used to work with Jordan but\u2026 John Reyes : I am sorry. We do have some properties that are highly occupied. There is probably one in there that\u2019s 99% and there may even be one at the 100% occupied and we\u2019ve seen that in our portfolio for our same store properties, but I would say the bulk of them are clustered. If you did like a bell curve, it would be very tight bell curve right around that 95%. Just the odds are it is probably nothing below \u2013 in the same store below 85%, because we would have done something with that property with pricing and promotion to try to push it back up real quick. So it is a fairly tight kind of bell curve around the 95%. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup: And then as we think about the acquisitions that you did last year, I think it was north of over a $1 billion. And I can remember last year we talked about yields, and Ron, I think you said it was 0% to 8%. I am curious now as those acquisitions have been under your belt for a little while, what that current yield is and where ultimately can go as we look at the \u201815 because arguably that\u2019s a nice piece of your growth platform? Ron Havner : Yes. Michael for the 2013 acquisitions for the six months, the yield was 5.1%, excluding merchandize and tenant insurance. And what it will be next year, I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s going to be higher. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you. Operator : And that appears to be your final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clemente Teng : We appreciate everybody\u2019s participation this morning, and we will talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

And we're taking down -- we will take down about $400 million plus of acquisitions this year. So it's turning out to be a pretty good 2014. With that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Jeremy Matz with Ross. Ron, can you just talk about how rent and discount trends have been going here into fourth quarter? Ronald L. Havner: Sure, I'll let John touch on that. The trends are positive. Edward John Reyes : Yes, month-to-date, in October, our move-in volumes, up about 3%. And the rates that are being taken are about up about 4%. So pretty happy about that. Street rates are up currently about 5.5%. I will say this, however, during the month of October, we did start discounting a little bit more than we had in the past. So our discounting is up about 5% or so. One of the things we're trying to do, as I mentioned in the last call, was we're trying to gap out our occupancy going to the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year, so we are spending more on television advertising as well as Internet advertising. And along those lines, we're also giving away more discounting to try to get our occupancy spreads wider. Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And on the -- and for the -- move-ins during the quarter, what was the realize -- the gap between the realized rents for the move-in versus move-outs? Edward John Reyes : For the quarter, folks were moving out at about $133 a month -- monthly rent versus move-ins were coming in at $131. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. So it sounds like that gap has actually narrowed some from prior quarters. Edward John Reyes : Yes. And if you want to compare it to last year -- the quarter of last year, they were moving out at $128 and moving in at $126. Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then, I think Ross had a question as well. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Ron, I missed unfortunately your lengthy opening comments, so hopefully you didn't touch on this. That was a joke. But can you talk about your development pipeline and in particular, it looks like you added $100 million of projects to the pipeline. Can you just review where those new projects are? And where do you see the overall size of that development pipeline going into next year? Ronald L. Havner: Sure, I have David here, so I'll let him, since he's doing all the work, explain the pipeline. But as I mentioned, I think I've mentioned in previous calls, we're trying to get up to a $300 million to $400 million pipeline run rate, which I'm very proud of the team for getting that, achieved this quarter. It will fluctuate quarter-by-quarter as there's deliveries and inflows. But pretty well got the development team staffed up now and they're starting to hit the stride. In terms of where we're developing, I'll have David kind of run through that with you. David F. Doll: Thank you, Ron. Today, we've got about -- we have developments going in 13 different states : California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, Maryland lead the list of locations where we're developing today. So it's really where the best opportunities to fit new development inside our existing portfolio. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : David, your modeling what for stabilize yields on those projects based on current market rate? David F. Doll: As high as we can get them. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : That's not overly helpful. Any numbers? Ronald L. Havner: Ross, I'd say you have to think about 200 to 300 basis points over acquisitions. And with that, that's your -- the third question, so I need you to get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Wanted to just understand how you thought about occupancy during this past quarter. Maybe a year ago, 1.5 year ago, we probably wouldn't have expected you to kind of hit 94-plus. So I'm just kind of wondering how you thought about maybe taking the occupancy to maybe even 96? And how you kind of thought about pricing? And just looking forward, as you said you're trying to narrow the gap, so how did you kind of think of it in terms of taking it up even further? Edward John Reyes : Well, I would say this, we're not about -- I mean, although maybe everybody thinks we're about occupancy. We're not about occupancy. We're really about revenue growth of long haul. And so to get that growth that we're targeting, we pulled in different levers whether it be occupancy, promotion, pricing and what have you. So it's for us, it's not solely about occupancy. It is important, don't get me wrong. But in the third quarter, we allowed the occupancy to tighten up with the spread to narrow vis-\u00e0-vis last year by being more aggressive on pricing and giving away less promotions. As we move into the next couple of quarters, we're going to try now to expand the occupancy. So we [indiscernible] between which lever to pull and which lever we think is going to be optimal to get us our revenue growth as we move forward. So it's not one component solely. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just -- there was another? Ronald L. Havner: I would add to that, John said what our long-term goal is, it's optimizing the revenue per foot. But at the end of the day, it's really cash flow per foot that we own. So expenses and CapEx go along with the revenue side of the equation. And so if you're trying to maximize your cash flow per foot of real estate that you own, you want an ideal situation, 100% of the building occupied, right? Because you want every square foot you own paying rent. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : No, that's a fair point. And then just one quick clarification on the expense side. I know you said you started maybe spending a bit more to kind of help manage the dip in the occupancy. But it seems like this is a pretty solid quarter in terms of expense management and on the payroll side, in advertising and I would've assumed maybe some of that has kind of run its course. But it just appears that maybe you could see a few more quarters of nice control there. How are you thinking about expenses? Ronald L. Havner: I think on the expense side, the big dip for the quarter was advertising, which was down almost $1 million year-over-year. Utilities moderated a bit. And then on-site payroll is down 2% and that's been trending down, as we've done some things to improve the efficiency out of the properties. That's all on our variance, productivity variance, not a rate variance. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So you'd say more so that is -- you've realized most of that or is there still more to come? Ronald L. Havner: Expense control and improvement in productivity is an ongoing thing here, so it's never done. And we have initiatives going in all areas to moderate expenses. So it's not a onetime thing or we just did one thing and that's the end of it. We're constantly doing things. As I've touched on before though, on the long run, despite our productivity and scale and all that, I mean, you should think about expense growth here for the long-term at 2% to 3%, especially given the waiving of property taxes being our largest expense and the fact that while we're aggressively appealing them and all sorts of things, we have -- we don't have as much control over property taxes as we do some other expense items. What John touched on in terms of advertising and selling is that in the fourth quarter of last year, basically had none. And this year, we'll probably have $2 million to $3 million in Q4 for advertising. So you'll see the expense growth pick up in Q4 but the big variable on our expenses is always, I should say, advertising and snow. Snow is the other big variable that we have year-over-year. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Burke of Green Street Advisors. Ryan Burke : Ron, your average construction cost on a current development pipeline is $115 per square foot. Can you talk about that mark relative to where stabilized assets or trading on a per square foot basis on those markets? Ronald L. Havner: Yes, it's a little hard to give you an exact number. I mean if you take our development pipeline in Texas, there's 11 properties, our blended cost per foot is $91. Austin, we're probably developing there in the low -- $105, $110 max, maybe $100. And we're seeing assets trade in that market North of $200. We've got some stuff here in California that we're developing at $124-foot, California usually trades north of $200 a foot. Arizona, we're developing at $80. We're seeing stuff trade there at $150. And then New York, that's really a redevelopment at $175 a foot and those traded $300 a foot plus. So I'd say somewhere between, if I had to make a guess, but it varies by market, 150% to 200% of replacement cost in some cases. Ryan Burke : Okay. And how does that gap compared to past development cycles Ronald L. Havner: I couldn't tell you. Ryan Burke : Okay. One more question. Is there a point where cap rates on your stabilized properties get so low that you start considering selling more assets obviously, with an eye towards recycling capital back into opportunities that are still right for value creation? Ronald L. Havner: Well, that's a logical question and something we think about. When you step back and look at Public Storage, we have a lot of firepower in terms of ability to acquire and/or develop assets. Our balance sheet is pretty under levered. So sitting back and thinking about selling assets, once you start to think about how under levered the balance sheet is, it kind of moves off of the priority list. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citigroup. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Ron, you talked about 200 to 300 basis point spread on the developments over acquisitions and I remember your comment from, I think it was last year, it was 0 to an 8 cap. So that 200 to 300 is off the 0 or it's off the 8? Ronald L. Havner: Come on, Michael. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I'm just curious, you had an average, what would be the average yield? Ronald L. Havner: I think developments are somewhere between 8% and 11%. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. You haven't been in the capital raising market from a preferred perspective in a bit. You have I think 250, 270 actually being able to be redeemed next year, I think at 145 in April, at [indiscernible] and 125 and 6.5 in October. I'm just curious as you think about potentially with the ramping development pipeline and ramping acquisitions, would you look to seek to do that at along? Edward John Reyes : To do what Michael? Ronald L. Havner: To redeem those... Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And also [indiscernible] and sort of where you think that capital cost would be today? Edward John Reyes : Well, I think a new preferred for Public Storage is probably about 6 to 6.8, somewhere in that neighborhood for Public Storage. Certainly not where we would like it to be. But we have other capital sources, a variety of sources. We talked about potentially issuing some debt in the past. We may go out in the fourth quarter, first quarter and raised some capital in anticipation of calling those preferreds and in anticipation of the ramp-up for the development expense. So I would expect that something within the next, probably, 4 to 5 months we would be out in the capital markets trying to do something. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And I guess your comment is given where the preferred pricing is, you'd prefer to go out and do that as debt rather than issuing preferred ? Edward John Reyes : Yes, I'm just saying that there's other possibilities. We could do preferred. That certainly are normal mode of operations but we can do debt. As Ron mentioned, our balance sheet is very, very delevered. We currently only have about $71 million of debt on our books. And that's dropping down as we move into the end of the fourth quarter. So we may tap into some of the debt markets, if possible. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, perfect. And then just last question just as we think about when the $342 million of the current development pipeline, it looks like most of the spend will occur by the end of next year. When should we start thinking about deliveries of that capital being spent from an income recognition standpoint, so should we think about, I don't know if there's going to be some stuff hitting next year and obviously, it will take time to stabilize, how should we think about that aspect? Ronald L. Havner: Michael, I think you ought to think about 300,000 to 400,000 feet a quarter coming online. Let's see, we've got, in Q4, we've got 8 properties, 450,000 square feet. Q1, '15, 8 properties 300,000; Q2, 5 properties, 500,000. That give you a sense is that what you were looking for like dollars? It's about $35 million, $40 million per quarter of developments coming online. Keep in mind though on developments, in our business, it takes 2 to 3 years to hit stabilization, normally. So they're generally going to lose money overall or breakeven if we're lucky in the first year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] . You're next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital. Todd M. Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Ron, just curious to get your broader thoughts on new supply. All 4 public company pipelines are increasing and the regional developers are looking to get involved to the extent that they can. What's your outlook here on new supply overall? Ronald L. Havner: Same as it has been, it's coming. We're ramped up. As I said, we're north of $300 million. And listening to some of the comments of the other CEOs in terms of what they're doing on CEVO deals and how they're thinking about buying CEVO properties and all that. I'm sure the developers are very excited to be building. And that will, in my mind, accelerate new supply. Todd M. Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, John, you mentioned that discounting is up in October. Is that up from September or is that up year-over-year? And last year, I'm curious in the fourth quarter, when did you begin to really start to increase discounts, at what point in the year? Edward John Reyes : Well, my commentary about it being up, it's year-over-year, October this year compared to October of last year. In terms of fourth quarter of last year, we discount like throughout the period. There's no kind of ramping up last year, really. So last year, we gave away discounts of about $19 million in the fourth quarter. I would expect that discounts will probably be a little bit above that. Right now, as I mentioned, we're up about 5%, that's month-to-date October. And depending on how the move-in volumes pick up, as well as occupancy spread ticks up, we'll throttle it back or increase it more, depending on how the volume picks up. Operator : Next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I was wondering if you could comment on some of the recent trends in the Shurgard portfolio and just sort of color on what you're expecting over the next 6 months or so? Ronald L. Havner: Well, the -- we started a pricing strategy in Europe, a really novel. Cut rates dramatically and won't behold more people move in. So we started getting really aggressive in the Q4 last year in Europe, and we've continued that into this year. And you're seeing the results with move-in rates, realized rents down, I see, for the quarter, about 3.7%, but a 7% uptick in occupancy, very strong move-in volumes, which is overall, leading to positive revenue per available foot. And we hit 90% at the end of Q3, which we haven't been at for several years. We've positive revenue growth in all markets, even Holland, which has been our Achilles' heel over the last couple of years, up 1.7% in the quarter. And my expectation is that you will see that revenue growth accelerate into 2015, as we achieve stabilized higher occupancy and are able to moderate the price concessions and discounting. Also, we call up, I think 2011, I believe it was 2011, the VAT in London, and we basically absorbed that, which is a 20% rent reduction on all existing tenants. And As those customers have rolled out, we've got a nice uplift in the U.K. Our same-store revenue growth in the U.K. for the quarter was up 5.8%. George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then one -- another question. Actually, going back to capital raising issues. In terms of debt that you guys you would potentially do, would you consider doing a traditional bond deal or is this potentially just another term loan? Ronald L. Havner: I'll let John elaborate, but in Q3, we did the -- the Shurgard team actually did a EUR 300 million bond offering. And so while it doesn't show up on our balance sheet, effectively 49% of that was ours. And the proceeds were used to repay the intercompany loan. So you could look at that as kind of a debt financing. So we have a variety of sources to think about in terms of where we get capital. John? Edward John Reyes : Yes, I don't really have much to add, George. I mean, again, we could issue preferred, still on the table. I don't want to suggest that that's off the table. But just want to make sure that folks understand that issuing debt is not off the table. It's something that we have considered and are still considering the possibility of issuing debt to be at either the public markets, private markets or what have you. So we're keeping our options open. We're not at that point where we need to do anything at this point in time. We have plenty of capital with cash on hand, our retained cash flow as well as our line of credit at this point in time. So we're not pressed to do anything at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : On the fourth quarter acquisitions, just wondering, do you have a blended occupancy number for them and the ones on the contract, too, I mean, what's the rough number? Ronald L. Havner: Yes, Mike, I think most of these are probably about 85% on a blended basis, I guess. Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And is that about what the Q3 wins were as well or is that lower? Ronald L. Havner: I don't have those numbers here. It's usually, probably 5 to 8 points of occupancy growth and most of the stuff we're buying but it varies by portfolio. Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then, given that today's the 31st, I'm sure you probably don't have the October 31 occupancies. But do you have a more recent mark like you typically provide when the call is -- the following week? Edward John Reyes : Yes, I mean, we're up on occupancy year-over-year. As John touched on, our move-ins are up. Net any move-ins versus move-outs, were up 151%, which sounds like, wow, that's incredible. We had 3,000 -- 3,300 net positive this month versus 1,300 last year, but the 31st is a big move-out day. So I wouldn't read too much into that number. I mean, those are the numbers, but it'll change by the end of today. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : John, I know you guys have a more conservative same-store NOI accounting policies than some of your peers. But I was curious, do you guys have the number if you included some of the acquisitions you've made and not waited 3 years for the inclusion of some cases, what your same-store NOI growth would've looked like? Edward John Reyes : No, I don't. We just don't think about it that way. That's not how we look at our same-stores. So no, I don't have that. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Yes, I mean, obviously for more comparative purposes than... Edward John Reyes : Yes, I'll tell you this, Ki Bin, by Monday, we will have filed our 10-Q, and we do breakout each of the vantage years of the acquisitions and you can easily just add those to our same stores and compute what the number is. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. This quarter, it seems interesting that a lot -- you guys included, a lot of self-storage peers have decided to on a year-over-year basis, maybe increase promotions or decrease rate a little bit earlier than you typically do, even though it is seasonal. Just curious what collectively, the self-storage company, I guess for yourselves are seeing out there that is causing you to maybe be a little bit more competitive on pricing heading into the winter? Edward John Reyes : Well, I can't speak on behalf of the other folks. I expressed kind of what our strategy is, and we're trying to take up some momentum on our occupancy spread. We're trying to gain to level out the seasonal trends in our occupancy. And view the fourth quarter and first quarter as areas where we can pick up some occupancy spread. So that's our game plan. And as a result of that, as I mentioned, we're spending more on television, a little more on Internet advertising and we're being a little more conservative on pricing and promotions. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Do you think that might create a little bit of risk in 4Q from the optical standpoint on same-store NOI? Edward John Reyes : Well, again, that's why I'm telling you about it. Because I think at the end of the day, our fourth quarter NOI is going to be negatively affected by it, but it certainly, I think will set up a decent or better-than-expected Q1. Ronald L. Havner: Ki, I would just add something on the same-store. We started doing that 20-plus years ago and the purpose of the same-store reporting, which is by the way, the same way we report to our directors, is to give people, investors, our shareholders, a picture of kind of the core underlying growth rate of the business. And what are the fundamental trends, so that people like you can figure out, okay, is the business growing, slowing down, what are the fundamental trends. And so unfortunately, to become a bit of a gamesmanship in terms of what's gets included in same-store and what doesn't. But that is the purpose and that's why John doesn't know what it is if you include recent acquisitions because that's not the purpose of reporting the number from our standpoint. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Ron, are you seeing anything in the business today from a competitive standpoint, from pricing standpoint that would lead you to believe that your same-store revenue growth can breakout higher from the call it, 5% to 5.5-ish percent range you guys have been in the last year or 2? Ronald L. Havner: I'll let John elaborate on that. But one of the things, Ross, that might give you a picture in terms of why that's a pretty darn good number. The Q, as John said that will be coming out on Monday, is the 5%, 5.5% is a blend of a whole bunch of markets, 2,000 properties. So at any one time, somewhere of 8%, 9%, I think Denver was up 9%, Q3 and then you have markets like D.C. which were up, maybe 1% in Q3. So depending on your portfolio weighting, you kind of get a mix that averages out to the 5.5%. In Northern California, the Pacific Northwest is really strong right now, LA is doing well. D.C. soft, Philly is picking up, but it's relatively soft. New York is coming off the hurricane over a couple of years ago, it's a 2% or 3% but having 5%, 6% a couple years ago. Edward John Reyes : And I'd add that Florida has lagged the rest of our portfolio. And one of the primary reasons for that is we added a lot of new product into Florida that were busy we're trying to fill up and we are filling it up. And so I think that Florida will show more strength. But let me kind of add a little bit more to what Ron is talking about. So for the West Coast properties, revenue growth for the quarter was 6.4% and Texas market, or the Texas properties were on average 6.7%. In the Southeast we're at -- excluding Florida, we're at 6.4%. So we have a lot of markets that are really doing really well. The Northeast is -- we've taken a bit of a hit on average, it's about 2.9%. So that's the drag on our portfolio right now. And some of that is constant as Ron said with respect to hurricane or super storm Sandy that has now, we're comping against that and it hurt New York and we've struggled in Washington, D.C. So can it get higher? It depends on your market mix and we're pretty diversified, so when one market is up, there's probably a market that's down. But on an overall net-net, I think 5% to 5.5%, as you mentioned, we've consistently done that for probably the last 3 years now. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And that sort of leads me to the follow-up, which is that's been in an environment lately that's had, I don't want to say 0 supply, but virtually 0 supply and that's changing and feels like it's going to be changing fairly rapidly given the spread between development yields and where market cap rates are. So if we look out a year from now, 1.5 years from now, is it unreasonable for the market -- is it unreasonable for investors to say, hey, what if the economy stays constant, supply is picking up, the self-storage industry is going to have a heck of a problem maintaining 5-ish percent same-store revenue growth? Ronald L. Havner: Ross, it's -- with the qualification of the portfolio where it's diversified, a number of markets are relatively straightforward to build in and a number of markets are very challenging to build in. If you take Los Angeles or San Francisco, the Bay Area, or Seattle, very challenging markets to build in. Not a lot of new supply. We're struggling to find product to build in those marketplaces. And yet, in those markets, especially in the urban areas, you have tremendous densification of population with the apartment construction. We were up in Seattle last week, and I was amazed at all the apartment construction going on up there. And we have a lot of properties in the Seattle market and they're going to benefit tremendously from that influx of people. You take a market like Dallas, Texas, right, it's not hard to build in. It's our highest volume market. And my guess that's a market that will probably get oversupplied faster and more than other markets around the country. Florida is usual market. It tends to get oversupplied. But if you're in Miami and West Palm Beach area, also very difficult to find land and very difficult to build in. And we have a big presence there. So that market will do better than average. So kind of depends on where your portfolio is and which market. Operator : Your next question comes from Paula Poskon of DA Davidson. Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Just to follow up on new supply. Are you seeing any increase in adaptive reuse and in-store locations? Ronald L. Havner: Redevelopment, Paula? Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Yes. Ronald L. Havner: Yes. Our derived properties are big redevelopment. We just took down a property, industrial building in Irvine that we're going to redevelop into industrial. So yes, we could take existing, other kind of building usage and reconfigure them to self-storage. Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : But are you seeing non-self-storage builders doing that, I guess? Ronald L. Havner: Non-self-storage builders. I don't have any anecdotal evidence. It's not something I monitor. So I really can't answer, yet on that. Operator : And this time, there are no further question. I Would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clemente Teng : Thank you for your attendance today's conference call, and we'll speak to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Havner: Thanks, Clem. We had a pretty good quarter Q4 and year in 2014. I want to commend the operations field support, [indiscernible] the Real Estate Groups for doing such a superb job last year and really positioning us well for a solid 2015. And with that, operator, let's open up for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS Ross Nussbaum : Hey, good morning guys. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how rent and discounting trended in Q4 on a year-over-year basis and how that translated into January? John Reyes : Yeah, this is John. From a discounting standpoint, we increased our discounting during the fourth quarter, which was consistent with what we talked about in the third quarter conference call. We wanted to ramp up the occupancy spread and we were going to discount more as well as spend more on television advertising which we did and we were able to accomplish our goal of increasing our occupancy. In terms of street rates and move-in rates they were both higher in the fourth quarter relative to fourth quarter of last year. On the moving rate which is more important to the street rate, moving were coming in at about 4% higher and we got about 4% more move-ins also. So it was a great quarter. We accomplished what we wanted to accomplish, so we're pretty happy with that. Ross Nussbaum : And have those trends held into January pretty well? John Reyes : Into January we did a little bit more television and move-in volumes kind of flattened out a little bit, but we were increasing street rates more and so we pretty much broke even on the move-ins, but they were moving in at rates that were higher than the 4% I would say. Ross Nussbaum : Okay and the second question from me on the Shurgard acquisition, the vintage [ph] market is about $250 a foot there which seems pretty rich. Can you just maybe give us a little more color on that since they bought it and if that's market or what was unique about those assets to drive the pricing there? Ronald L. Havner: Well, I'll say the portfolio is about 69%, 70% occupied on a trailing NOI basis the NOI is somewhere between 4% and 5% and you should know, European rental rates on average are about double the U.S. Ross Nussbaum : Okay, thanks I guess. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Ki Bin Kim : Hi, good morning. Could you, actually your third quarter 10-Q does give in your fourth quarter not yet, but I know in this sector and most real estate sectors that the same-store definition is a little bit different by company. Yours is always a little more conservative because I know you wait three years for assets to move into your pool. But going back to the third quarter Q, it seems like the poppy [ph] pool from 2013 the things that you bought the NOI differential in 3Q 2014 over 3Q 2013 was about $15 million. So it has been pretty substantial, and your 2012 pool was up only $1.4 million. Now just hypothetically, if you, just major definition a little bit more loose and more some of the two other companies that sat there, how would your 6.8% same-store NOI growth, what would that be, would it be close to 8 or more than that or less than that, just curious, because I'm really trying to look at it from an apples-to-apples basis. Ronald L. Havner: Well, Ki, I'll touch on that and then I'll let John add. I don\u2019t know to whether I could call a same-store pool more conservative I would call it more practical because if you, and what we're trying to do is give you the investor as well as our directors and is this the way we run the company as well, what's an apples-to-apples comparison of the business in terms of our store performance by properties and we're not trying to manage to a number or put in properties that clearly are not stabilized to improve our same-store NOI. So the number that we published for you and put the 10-K and the 10-Q are the same kind of numbers that we run the business with. And properties that aren\u2019t stabilized go into a non-stabilized pool and the management teams are measured on those differently than they are in same-store operation. What the numbers are with non-stabilized properties in them is obviously they'd be higher because the properties aren\u2019t stabilized and so their growth rates are higher. What it is I don\u2019t know. John? John Reyes : No, I have nothing to add to that. Ki Bin Kim : Okay and just a second question, if I look at your New York revenue growth and not just your New York assets, but for most of the public peers and with no stores in New York it doesn\u2019t seem like from a same-store revenue standpoint is really growing that much faster than any other market and even the sick bucket you call other markets is pretty close to that or better. So just curious, is the market like New York really based on the pricing, is it really going to put up that much better growth and you think just self-storage in most other markets or is it like kind of like 2014 anomaly? John Reyes : Yeah, you know, if you're referring specifically to New York and we talked about that in the third quarter also, where we mentioned that as part of the problem we had was a year-over-year comp because we saw a huge lift from super storm Sandy, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 and that carried over in throughout 2013 where occupancies were very high in New York and we were experiencing above the average rental rate growth. When we got to 2014 then the comps became very difficult and so that's what you're seeing in New York, and if you're looking at Q3 and the when we show you Q4 in our 10-K you'll see a similar thing. But what we are seeing now as the comps now, we're kind of rounding the corner again, New York is beginning to fare better, meaning that the year-over-year growth is going, is starting to rise and get back on track to what I would say normal growth would be for it. Ronald L. Havner: Ki, if you look across the portfolio in Q4 and you'll see this when the K is out, you're going to see an acceleration on the West Coast market. For example, if you take Portland for the year it was up 7.4, but in Q4 was up 8.6, San Diego for the year was up 4.9, but for the fourth quarter up 6.6, Sacramento for the year up 4.7, but Q4 6.6, Los Angeles for the year 5.2, but for the quarter 6.1. So, you've seen a real acceleration in the rate of growth in our West Coast markets and then also in some of the Florida markets, Orlando for the year was 4.4, but in Q4 5.6. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jana Galan : Thank you. And on the third quarter call you mentioned looking at other debt financing options, you know, curious why you decided on the preferred financing in December and how you're thinking about capital needs in 2015? Ronald L. Havner: Well, the preferred financing in Q4 we thought the 5.80 or 5.87 was a pretty attractive rate. It wasn\u2019t a big trade, but it was and it was a nice trade below 6% coupon. Regarding the debt financing we're still looking at various options. Do you have anything to add on that John? John Reyes : No, I think right now we're not under pressure to do anything even though our development pipeline is ramping up as we've noted in the press release, but for the most part the ramp up in development can be funded with our retained cash flow. So the big question mark for us is the acquisition environment and how that plays out for the rest of the year. Currently we're sitting on about $150 million to $180 million of cash. Most of that is from that preferred that we issued in December. But as Ron said, we are looking at potentially issuing that, but that's not something that we feel under pressure to be doing any time soon. Jana Galan : Thank you and then just a quick question on advertising, if you can kind of comment on paid search trends, where you think the pricing will increase in '15 and maybe with the decision to continue doing TV advertising? John Reyes : Yes we did. As I mentioned we did television in Q4. We did some in January. We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of television advertising. My gut is that we will probably do similar amounts as we did in 2014, but that kind of remains to be seen. Our occupancies are so high right now; it gets more and more difficult to justify spending television advertising dollars. With respect to other advertising, we continue to spend money on either search terms with both Google and Yahoo and I expect that to continue probably at the same paces we've experienced in 2014. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Thanks. I wanted to ask you just about the payroll, and I know you've talked earlier in the year about reducing hours and it did decline again in the fourth quarter and of course for the year, just are you seeing any pressure at that segment of the labor market and any thoughts on where pricing might go in 2015? Ronald L. Havner: Well, I think Smedes we've done some things to improve labor productivity in the course of 2014 and I would anticipate probably a little more normalized rate of increase in wages between 1% and 2% in 2015 year-over-year. And I say that not knowing the impact that Wal-Mart's decision to increase their wage rates is going to have in terms of our ability to recruit people. So that was just announced and I don\u2019t know what impact that's going to have, because we usually, we're kind of in that labor market wage rate, so for our people that we hire is relief managers. So, hard to anticipate the impact of that right now. Smedes Rose : Okay that's helpful and then on the Shurgard expenses, was that, it looked like they went up a lot in the fourth quarter, is that just transaction oriented and related without sort of stabilized going forward? Ronald L. Havner: Are you talking about the same-store operating expenses that were up quite a bit? Smedes Rose : Yes? Ronald L. Havner: Yeah, that was, we had some credits in the fourth quarter of last year that we didn't have in the fourth quarter of this year and then they accelerated some R&M and yeah, the credits were mainly related to property taxes. So they look higher, but I think if you look at the full year they are pretty good expense control for the full year. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with Keybanc. Todd Thomas : Hi thanks, good morning. Just following up on the Shurgard Europe acquisition, I was wondering Ron, maybe can you frame up what the investment opportunity set for Shurgard Europe looks like, you know, what the pipeline looks like and maybe what the current thinking is towards investments there? Ronald L. Havner: Yeah, Todd, as you probably know 2014 the investments we made combined around $90 million $95 million are the first investments we made in quite some time in Shurgard. We've really been focusing on taking the cash flow and deleveraging the entity with a completion of the private placement in June of last year, refinancing the debt, Shurgard has a fair amount of free cash flow and so they've been ramping up their opportunity set in terms of acquisitions and development. And so, at year end I think we have three or four properties in the pipeline to develop in London and then we did this acquisition in Germany. And I would anticipate that you'll see more activity out of Shurgard in 2015. We generally don't comment on transactions and they've got some stuff in the hopper, so I don\u2019t want to really get into what the details are, but I would anticipate that Shurgard will be active again in 2015. Todd Thomas : Okay and then second, on the developments, domestic developments, you're starting to deliver that product in the market now and I was wondering if you could just give us an update, any thoughts on sort of lease up timeframes here. I know historically I believe it would take anywhere from maybe three or four years or so to lease up and stabilize and the development I know your large Bronx facility leased up much quicker than that. I'm just curious what you think the average time is to get these projects delivered over the next 12 months the stabilization might look like? Ronald L. Havner: Yes. Our underwriting of to achieve stabilization has not changed. It's generally somewhere between three and four years depending on the property size and that achievement of stabilization and part of our underwriting is we impute a cost to carry until we do achieve stabilized NOI. So far we've been fortunate. I believe most if not all of our developments are ahead of schedule in terms of pro forma occupancies and cash flow. They are not ahead of schedule in terms of achieving targeted rents and that's by design in terms of we use a different pricing strategy for developments than we do for stabilized properties. The Bronx, the Gerard property is actually about 92% occupied today, which if you would ask me 18 months ago when it opened, if it would be at 92% occupied and 18 months with 4000 units, I would have laughed. So the pricing group, the marketing groups have done a great job in operations in getting that property filled up and that's kind of the way it's working across the platform. So hopefully, we'll be delivering pleasant surprises with respect to our developments, but our underwriting hasn\u2019t changed. Todd Thomas : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Hi guys, just want to see if I can get the occupancy for the end of January? Ronald L. Havner: Yeah, George, it's about, occupancy is about 93% versus 92%, 93% last year. George Hoglund : Okay. Okay, got you. And then also just wondering if you can comment on the potential FX impacts from a Shurgard portfolio and sort of how you're addressing that for 2015? John Reyes : With respect to the foreign currency exchange? George Hoglund : Yes? John Reyes : Well, there's not a lot we can do about the dollar strengthening against the euro, that\u2019s we're really trying to, it is certainly going to have a negative effect on Public Storage, given that I think for all of 2014, I think the average exchange ratio was somewhere about 1.32, where as the euro, I think that exchange rate today is somewhere down about 1.54. So it's about a 13%, 15% decline there. Meaning all things being equal, the income we pick up from Shurgard Europe will go down. Keep in mind however that Shurgard Europe represents about 5% of our FFO or so. So it's not a significant impact on the overall Public Storage earnings potential. Ronald L. Havner: We were fortunate that our intercompany loan, we financed just about a month before the precipitous decline in the euro, because that would have been a real hit. George Hoglund : Okay and then can you also comment on rental rates in Europe given you're still seeing year-over-year declines in the Shurgard portfolio? Ronald L. Havner: You mean what is the outlook for rental rates in Europe? George Hoglund : Yes? Ronald L. Havner: Yeah, you know in Europe we've gotten really aggressive on pricing to drive occupancy and we've been able to do that. I think we're up 500, 600 basis point year-over-year in occupancy, but the net effect of both of those is that we've still been able to deliver positive revenue for available foot growth. So while the rates have gone down, the volume has increased greater, so revenue growth is positive. I would expect that to continue in 2015 because our average for year 2014 was about 86% and Mark and the team over there are targeting to get their portfolio up to 90% to 91%. So I think you'll see probably continued in place rent movement down offset by higher volume and I think we'll see some pretty good top line revenue growth net, net out of Shurgard in 2015. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks, very helpful. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : You talked about Europe being more active seemingly on the acquisition side. You know, looking at the press release you talked about a new \u20ac40 million credit facility. Was that meant to be a one-off facility for the acquisitions or is that something that can be expanded, you know, fund anything that's on your plate going forward? John Reyes : The \u20ac40 million is a revolver Mike, and so it has a term of about three and half years. So yes, they're putting it in place to help fund the acquisition, but to the extent they do pay it down between now and the facility expires they can redraw on the line on that revolver. Michael Mueller : Okay, thanks. Okay, that was it, thanks. Ronald L. Havner: Yeah Mike, your question might lead to what is the financing capacity of Shurgard and under their loan the private placement that they did in June, I think they have borrowing capacity of another \u20ac100 million, \u20ac150 million. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay that was helpful, thanks. Bye. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinksy with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Salinksy : Hey, good afternoon guys. Just given the higher occupancy kind of going into the year this year as well as it sounds like keeping the advertising cost the same, just kind of talk about where you see the greatest opportunities on the releasing front in 2015, whether maybe you plan to push rate a bit more just given the high occupancy, how much concessions are left to reduce, can you just kind of talk about that a little bit? Ronald L. Havner: Mike, I'll start and I'll let John add to this. You know, if you look at Q4 we were able to do what I think are two really incredible things. We were able to move period in occupancy up 0.8% which is a real achievement in the fourth quarter as well as move in-place rents up from 4.6% to 4.9%. So, moving in-place rents as well as the occupancy in Q4 really set us up nicely for January.  And if you go back to what we've been talking about, our opportunities on occupancy are really in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. So what we did on the promotional discounts and the television in Q4 not only helped our positioning, our revenue growth in Q4, which accelerated over Q3, but it's positioned us nicely going into Q1 for higher occupancies and higher in-place rent. John Reyes : And I would add to that, I think that street rates are going to be higher this year. I think we're seeing competition now pushing street rates more aggressively than they have in the past, probably due to the fact that their occupancies are much higher than they have experienced before, which overall is a good thing for Public Storage because that's been one of our more difficult places to grow revenue. So, as I mentioned, we are seen move-in rates starting to accelerate. Hopefully that will continue. I would also think that the level of discounting will subside, will come down. In Q4 we gave away approximately $20 million of discounts. On an annual basis that's about $80 million. So there's a lot of room to reduce discounting. So we'll work on that also. Ronald L. Havner: The third bucket Mike, just to add to that is, customers greater than a year up-ticked in Q4 as well at 56.7% versus 55.8%. So we ended the year with about 10,000 plus more customers in that age cohort of greater than a year. Michael Salinksy : Thanks, very helpful, and then just is my follow-up question. You talked about Europe and the acquisition opportunities seen there. Can you talk a little bit about the U.S.? I mean, obviously third quarter, fourth quarter activity seemed to pick up there, are you seeing more product on the market? And then just given the success that you've had in expanding the development pipeline over the last few months, are opportunities becoming more plentiful there? Ronald L. Havner: Well, Q1 is typically a low product opportunity. There's not a lot of product coming into the marketing in Q1. It really starts to pick up in Q2 and Q3. So there's not a lot of stuff in the market right now in terms of acquisitions. As we move through 2014, I would tell you pricing continued to get more and more aggressive. We've moved out into some other markets, where we have a strong presence, but out of some of the more core competitive markets in terms of acquisitions and I would tell you, I mean there's deals getting done well below five cap rates on the acquisition front, which is I'd have to say we somewhat saw this coming a couple years ago which is why we've accelerated the development pipeline. And if you look at our pipeline it's almost double what it was at the end of 2013 and I think you'll see us continue to try to accelerate that form of expansion vis-\u00e0-vis acquisitions. We are very happy with our development pipeline, both the growth of it and the quality of the assets. Michael Salinksy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Ki Bin Kim : A couple of quick follow ups, what is the percent of customers receiving a discount in the fourth quarter this year versus last year? John Reyes : Yeah, Ki, I don\u2019t have that in front of me, but I would, my gut reaction is probably somewhere about 76 versus, I don\u2019t know a little less than that last year. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, and I know you guys don\u2019t typically do this, but just given where your occupancy rates are and your commentary regarding street rates that might be improving in 2015, jus t ballpark figure, what do you think your portfolio can handle or push through in terms of street rates in 2015? John Reyes : I don\u2019t know, I wouldn\u2019t want to guess. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. John Reyes : I know it will be wrong. Ki Bin Kim : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. David Bragg : Operator : Dave, your line is open. David Bragg : Yes, thank you, good morning. Can you hear me? Ronald L. Havner: Yeah, Dave, how are you? David Bragg : Great. Most of my questions have been answered, but I want to follow up on your point made on the low acquisition cap rates driving you incrementally into development, to what degree are you seeing that across the rest of the market, how much new supply do you observe under construction today relative to a year ago? Ronald L. Havner: Well it's simple and so it's more and I'd tell you it's more than people realize. We had a real estate meeting yesterday and I was surprised that the number of markets where we're starting to see development. So there is a fair mount more activity than people realize. And it's logical, like if you are a developer and you've got these public companies buying the CIVO deals nice bridge to what you can build it for. Why not build the product? And it is coming to market. You know and Texas is an easier market to build in and so there is a fair amount of product coming online in Dallas and Houston, the Carolinas. So we're going to see more and more development. David Bragg : So is it your sense that the construction environment has loosened up considerably for the private developers? Ronald L. Havner: Yes. David Bragg : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hey, Ron this is Ross this time in case you didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t me before. Ronald L. Havner: I thought your voice had changed. Ross Nussbaum : Thank you. So if I look at the per square foot cost of your acquisitions that you did last year I think was about $128 a foot. If I look at the cost of your current development pipeline, you're building to about 117 a foot and I know it's not directly apples-to-apples in terms of the geographic mix. But I guess my question is, do you think it is a fair comment to say that you're paying above replacement cost for the acquisitions? That's part A. John Reyes : Yes. Ross Nussbaum : And if that's true, which sounds like it is, why not and I know you've accelerated development but why not put even more capital into the development bucket and pulled back on acquisitions? Ronald L. Havner: Ross, we are trying, you know it may relative to our size $400 million may not look like a lot, but that's what we reported on is like a pipeline of 29, 30 properties, behind that or another 25 or so properties that we're working on to get into the development pipeline. So there is a lot of properties in that mix. We've ramped up the staff considerably and as we get more and more comfortable in terms of the market, people in place, the experience, I think you will see the development pipeline increase. The great thing about the development pipeline is obviously we're building the replacement cost, we're building brand now product. We're getting into submarkets where there is little competition and where we have little product. So we're really able with the development teams to fill in markets and submarkets that we want to be in and really improve our market share and the quality of our portfolio in the various markets. Ross Nussbaum : And just remind me again the stabilized yield that you guys are building to based on current market rents as well? Ronald L. Havner: Oh, you know it varies by property, but I'd say somewhere between 8 and 10. Ross Nussbaum : And just an extension of that prior questions, if that's true, right and people are paying pretty low cap rates today, why aren't we about to see, for lack of a better word, an explosion in self storage construction in the next 12 to 24 months? Ronald L. Havner: Well, Ross it's still hard to do, but as I just touched on with Dave Bragg, there is more development going on and it is accelerating. If you think back two years ago no one was really talking about development except us and now you go to the self storage conferences and everyone's talking about development and trying to do it. So, I believe you will see an acceleration of development. We are seeing it and it will continue to accelerate. And in some markets like Austin there was a portfolio that traded north of 200 bucks a foot and we're developing in Austin at $80 to $90 a foot. I assume a local guy there can development at $100. I mean that's a big spread I'd say. Ronald L. Havner: Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with D.A. Davidson. Paula Poskon : Thank you. I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the new supply and the amount of development Ron. Are you seeing that any development in what you would consider to be good infill locations or way back to raising the cornfields at the edge of town? Ronald L. Havner: Well, we don\u2019t spend a lifetime in the cornfields, so I can't tell you about that. In terms of\u2026 Paula Poskon : Metaphorically speaking\u2026 Ronald L. Havner: In terms of, yes, yes, now I know. Where we're seeing the more development in markets where you would expect the southeast where it's easier to build and Texas where it's easier to build. So it's logical, oh and yes, Dave Doll is here in New York. New York we started to see development pick up 18 months ago and a lot of stuff is really coming online in New York. So those are the major markets. And we're doing some stuff, but we are doing some stuff in California. We don't see other people doing stuff in California, not a lot in Florida to give you some idea. Paula Poskon : That's helpful and are you seeing much redevelopment or repurposing? Ronald L. Havner: Well, we've been doing redevelopment for five or eight years. In terms of what other people are doing I can't comment. I mean that's an ongoing part of our program. So we've been doing it and we will continue to do that. Paula Poskon : Okay, thanks very much. Ronald L. Havner: Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn this conference over to management for closing remarks. Clemente Teng : Well, I thank everybody for participating on our call today and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem. We had another solid quarter. We continue to execute on all fronts. In the U.S. and Europe revenue growth continues to accelerate, our development pipeline continues to expand and industry fundamentals are good. With that operator let's open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Europe is obviously pretty small this point relative to everything overall, can you just an update on pricing, occupancy and NOI trends there? Unidentified Company Representative : Occupancy for the quarter was for all of Europe was 87.9 versus 82.1 last year, so up 7.1%, rates were backwards 3%. So REVPAF was up close to 4%, 3.8 for the quarter. So, we\u2019re feeling good about Europe. All markets, but one was up in NOI and Holland our most challenging market, occupancy was 81.4 versus 70.7 last year, so a big 15% increase in occupancy year-over-year. Michael Mueller : And I forget is there a follow-up or is it just one question? Unidentified Company Representative : You can follow-up. Michael Mueller : Can you talk a little bit about the G&A increase relative to prior quarters and what\u2019s a good run rate to expect for the balance of 2015? John Reyes : This is John. So our G&A for the year quarter was about 24 million and that compared to last year at around 19 million. And the major swing items, the increases were basically of three categories; one was a share-based compensation expense which was up about $1 million; the second item was our development overhead that\u2019s been expensed, that was up about 0.5 million and then legal cost which is up about 4 million for the quarter. So on a run rate basis going forward, I would expect that our G&A although it's running about 24 million for the quarter, don\u2019t think they will run 24 million for each of the next three quarters, but it will continue to run higher than last year. Primarily due to we expect additional increase to legal cost as well as share based compensation and development overhead cost the expense, so expect higher G&A going forward. Michael Mueller : And what\u2019s the legal cost tied to? John Reyes : Various litigation matter, I mean various parts for the company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Jeremy Matson : Jeremy Matson with Ross. I was just wondering if you can take a little bit more about traction that you're making on rate growth you obviously see some good acceleration in 1Q, it appears to be at some of the highest levels in quite a long time and just how much of an impact lower discount is having and where realized rents were moving, were relative to move outs. John Reyes : Jeremy this is John again. For the quarter our street rates were up about 6% roughly and our move in rates were up about a little over 5%. Our volume of move ins were up about 1.3% and so I'm pretty happy that we're able to move street rates and people are accepting those higher rates. And we're seeing competition also raise their street rates, which we really haven't seen a whole lot over the past couple of years. So I got to believe everybody is fairly full and people are getting more aggressive on rates. On the discounting side, at least for the quarter the number move ins receiving discounts was -- the percentage was about the same as the first quarter of last year. So roughly about 80% of our move ins were getting discount. I expected that as we move forward given our occupancies we'll start turning now back and we're starting to do that in the month of April. Street rates continue to move higher in April. They're now somewhere in the neighbourhood of about 7% higher and moving rates are also moving higher at this point of time. So [indiscernible] right now. Jeremy Matson : Great and then just one for Ron if I can, just a little bit bigger picture on the development front more broadly obviously you guys pipeline grew a little bit this quarter but anecdotally we're hearing about pickup from all the new money [indiscernible] stores, it's looking for different ways beyond the acquisitions and the looking at more fair deals just kind a giving your footprint where you're see any sort nationally in the development front? Ron Havner : Jeremy, we start our development program a couple of years ago in part because acquisition pricing was starting to trend above replacement cost and I said, it's many cases well above that and so we're already happy we've got a good development program growing at -- despite some meaningful deliveries this quarter, we still expended the pipeline. So worked at 31 projects about 3.6 million square feet. We're seeing increased development across the U.S. Is it something to worry about today? No not really. It's kind of natural given the comments John just said in terms of rates moving up, it's natural then that developers will look at those rates by us and others would say okay at those rates I can develop and make a decent return on capital. Jeremy Matson : We have David Doll here any color you on development? David Doll : No, I think we're pretty happy with the things that we're opening. In fact we'll open one next Tuesday in Glendale and continue to see other new development in natural markets like Miami, Houston, Dallas but not so much in Southern California, Northern California or some of our other key markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line George Hoglund of Jeffery. George Hoglund : Yes internally acquisition environment, are you seeing any difference in the composition of potential buyers out there and also any difference in the motivation from sellers of anyone feeling more of a rush to get deals done nowadays? David Doll : Not in terms of -- David Doll again. Not in terms of new equity players, there has been a constant inflow of folks trying to come in to the marketplace. I don't think that's changed any perception any over the last several quarters but in terms of quality of product coming to the marketplace, we don't see high quality products available today and hence it's one of the reasons why we're so happy with our development program, it gives us an opportunity to bring better product to the market player to our customers. George Hoglund : And then in terms of development you guys are seeing outside of the projects you guys are doing? [Tough that's] schedule become online in your markets generally who are the developers or the operators of these facilities? David Doll : Many of the local regional players that have continue to hold their portfolios and have active development programs started. There are a number of developers that has sold out in the prior 2006, '07, '08 timeframes; they're back in business again trying to start up development programs. So, it's generally people that have [technical difficulty] business over the years. Ron Havner : Keep in mind, remember the industry rights got 50,000 facilities to top five operators have less than 10% market shares to the industry's highly fragmented. And you can extrapolate that into the development programs as well. It's highly fragmented -- a lot of small one, two, three property operators doing development programs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : I was curious, where do you think the portfolio can get from an occupancy standpoint is 96% possible in late July, along lines are you seeing any changes in move out activity related to existing customer rent increases any changes in behaviour around that? Unidentified Company Representative : I'll start and Ron can jump in as. In terms of changes in customer behaviour with rate increases, no we haven\u2019t seen any changes there is still a very sticky for the most part we're seeing tenants are being with this longer than year an annual increase and we're not seeing any change in that. In fact we're seeing that our ageing of our tenant base is actually continues to improve I think we're just about 56.5%, 57% of our tenants have been here longer than a year. So that continues to improve how high can occupancies get, I don't know I made and I think two years ago saying that that can get higher than 94 and were higher than 94. So can I get to 96 we have properties that are at 96 we have properties that are probably higher than 96. So there are certain properties and maybe even markets that can get to those levels but I don\u2019t think our entire portfolio can get there. Ron Havner : Just to add during April we had three markets where the market as a whole was 97% or better occupied during the month of April. I would agree with John to get 2000 properties at 97% is probably not going to happen. Unidentified Analyst : Okay that\u2019s helpful. And if I could just follow up with regard to litigation matters, can you just shed some light on what that pertains to seems like sort of a big number? Is that something that you foresee continuing throughout the balance of the year? John Reyes : Whatever we could talk about will be in the 10-Q. So that\u2019s what you should read kind of clarity on the litigation. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask you as you look back on some of the properties that you've acquired are you reaching stabilization maybe faster than you would have expected given how strong fundamentals are in the business. And as you look forward have you changed your expectations around how long it would take to reach stabilization as you lease up new assets. Ron Havner : Generally what we do on properties that aren\u2019t what we consider stabilized 90% plus occupancy is we'll tend to be a little aggressive actually a lot aggressive on rate to fill them up. And as they fill up and stabilize then we'll start to push the street rate and the in place rent customers. Are we filling up faster than we anticipated yes, you take the Gerard property which opens in May or June of 13 4,000 units and ended April at 93.9%. I think we forecast that property taking four years to fill up and it's basically filled up in less than two. So much faster than we anticipated however it is filled up at lower rates than we anticipated it. But we think we'll make that up and so net to net we'll be ahead of the game and we're seeing that in both our developments and acquisitions. The table that is in the press release if you look at the 2013 acquisitions kind of give you an indication of what we're doing last year there were at 863 then in Q1 at 928 so up 7.5% and then you see the contract rents moving from $13.25 to $14 are up 5.7%. So you should expect in that portfolio that maybe occupancy comes up a little bit in terms of stabilization but at the rates will continue to move up at above average levels for probably the next couple of years because we filled then up at bit below market rates. Smedes Rose : And then I just wanted to ask you announced redemption of some preferred in the quarter. Are you still leaning towards issuing that at some point as well for your financing needs and as much as you have any but or perhaps your thoughts around that changed at all. Ron Havner : No we're still looking at potential issuance of debt on time in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Ki Bin Kim : So [hawing] up on the last question if you did pursue that where is you mind set because obviously you expand your line of credit. Is it more shorter term duration or are you looking more at the 30 year type of range. John Reyes : What we did expand our line of credit so most likely what we'll do is we'll get in deep into our line of credit before we start thinking about longer tenure debt. We could do anything from 7, 10, 12, 15 with 30. I think we can look at the whole spectrum and tranche up [that we see a] best fit for public storage. We have invented that point to have to make a decision yet but I think we have a lot of options open for us. Unidentified Analyst : And maybe just turn to your same-store expenses, you\u2019ve done a very good job of keeping it very flat and we were mostly other expect a lot of expense increases, just curious besides the payroll part of it, which we talked last quarter, but how are you keeping in flat for a while and notice that your allocator overhead was favorable to the expense number by a 1 million or so? If you could talk about that and how long can this be or does it -- you have to return like an inflationary rate? John Reyes : Well the answer to the second part of your question will it return long-term to an inflationary rate, yes we consistently say that. Having said that as we\u2019ve also consistently said, we\u2019re always working away to take cost out of our system to get more efficient, more productive in all aspects of our business. If you look at Q1, big increase item was snow removal; we were up $1 million over last year. I can\u2019t believe we're up a $1 million over last year\u2019s where we were. Utilities are down, gas prices are down, oil prices are down and so I think -- and we\u2019ve renegotiated some new utility contracts. So I think that number could remain flat to slightly down. Advertising and selling were 95%, occupy there is a not a lot of need for that. I think when we get to Q2, we didn\u2019t did do advertising in Q2 last year, so you won\u2019t see advertising this year. So that line will probably be flat and whether we do advertising, the balance of this year is yet to be determined. Other direct property tax cost were up 3.6 and then allocated overhead was down mainly because we used to have our annual sales conference in the first quarter and we moved it into the third and fourth quarters of last year and so last year was a double up and this year we have the expense savings in Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : For the acquisitions already completed this year, the annual contract rent is 11.65 and just lower than some of the previous years. Is there anything we can read into that number, is it a reflection in the markets you're entering or any [see about] deals included in that? John Reyes : It's a function -- it really varies by market. You\u2019ve got some of the properties are down in Texas and I think we got under contract in East Palo Alto it probably has a in place rent of double what is down in Houston. So just depends on which markets for the properties are in that quarter's acquisitions. We\u2019re not sitting here targeting, we want to buy properties at $13 or $14 of in place rents. It's really a function of do we want that property? Yes and therefore the rent -- the rent makes sense and so we\u2019ll buy it. Todd Stender : Maybe the sample size is small item looking at. And then just second, can you provide any color in the land lease buyout that you had in Q1? John Reyes : It was a remnant transaction from the Shurgard merger in \u201906 and we had an option to acquire the land lease this year and so with a pretty terming formula and we exercised our option and closed on the transaction. But pretty good transaction for us, only 15 million, but it's pretty good transaction. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019ll now return the call to management for any additional or closing remarks. Unidentified Company Representative : We appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in Public Storage in our first quarter\u2026wait, there is one more call there. Operator : You do have a question from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors. Dave Bragg : Just bigger picture question on supply for you, there is a lot of concern over this new supply; it's emerging, but in light of your strong operating results. The question is, how much new supply does the industry need? It seems the supply is needed and when you take a step back Ron and you look at eight square feet per capita, does that seem like the right level going forward? Ron Havner : Dave, I think I said that before and if you kind of take the U.S. population, seven square feet, eight square feet per capita, normal population growth of 1% a year or you're going to take 50,000 facilities and 1% a year that\u2019s 400 to 500 facilities per year and that kind of keeps everything at seven feet or eight feet per capita. I will tell you as you go across the country markets very greatly between two square feet and three square feet per capita and 12 square feet and 15 square feet per capita and obviously the ones that have the higher square footage tend to have lower rate growth rate. If you ask me where development will happen fastest. New York has been working on development programs for a while, so I think we\u2019ll see big uptick meaningful uptake in supply in the New York area. And then across the country vary between infield markets and then outline markets where it's easier to get zoning, permitting and land is cheaper. But 400 to 500 properties a year kind keeps things static and we haven\u2019t had much developments since '09. So we kind of four five years behind in terms of the curve of new supply relative to organic population growth. Dave Bragg : So the industries saw a significant sector shift in terms of growth of square feet per capital of may be three 20 years ago to eight today. Seems like your thought is that we grow in line with growth in line with population growth would make sense that -- not the result the demand that we're seeing don\u2019t necessarily indicated that we need nine or 10 square feet per capital. Ron Havner : I guess my point mentioning the nine or 10 like I know Austin has got over 11 square feet per capita and Austin is a pretty good market for us. So is the max 7? I don\u2019t think so it varies my market and could the country wide in the U.S could we go to a 10 or 11 square foot per capita? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable given the trend to a movement to apartments smaller homes especially in markets like Manhattan and San Francisco and even parts of LA. It\u2019s not impossible to get to a 10 or 11 per square foot is that going to happen I can't say. Unidentified Analyst : One quick housekeeping one you've referenced us to the 10-Q is that coming out today. Ron Havner : Probably next week David. Operator : Your next question is a follow up from Smedes Rose of Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here. Ron I may miss your opening comments because I dialed in late. Did you commented in terms of how you are going replace the COO role I know Shaun left in March to be I think see some private educational company. Can you just a little a bit about what those plans are. Ron Havner : Well those plans have already been put in place. We have divided up the country and given responsibility to three outstanding executives that are been with public storage 15 plus years. And those three exceptional executive are now running operations Michael Bilerman : By committee. Ron Havner : With the team. Michael Bilerman : The three report effectively and I ask it more -- I think the CEO role has had some turnover over the last five or six I think Shaun made third in that seat. So I didn\u2019t know if there was something structurally that wasn\u2019t working just talk about what those inhibitors just reasons why each of them left. Ron Havner : There are different reasons why each of them left but you can describe it to my inability to hire a COO. So I'm just leaving it at that but the guys we have running the operations are long time public storage execs that have grown up here in the operations and -- well, you can tell by the results they're doing an exceptional job. Michael Bilerman : And then what was the change in Chief Legal Officer during the year was that a retirement or what transpired there? Ron Havner : Yes Steve retired and actually I don\u2019t know what Steve is doing. But he is retired and we brought on [indiscernible]. Operator : At this time there are no further questions I'll now turn the call to Clemente Teng for additional or closing remarks. Clemente Teng : Thank you again for your interest in Public Storage and we'll speak to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Public Storage first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We had another solid quarter, hitting on all cylinders in Europe and in the U.S. and our development pipeline in tenant reinsurance. So, with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you about your -- about Shurgard there, obviously, made some fairly large acquisition in the quarter and things seem to be going very well there. Haven\u2019t met with your team over there quite recently? How do you think about your ownership there going forward either in the public vehicle or in a private vehicle or kind of -- or do you just like the status quo? Ron Havner : Well, right now Smedes, our Shurgard Europe is relatively or modest leveraged. They just did another \u20ac300 million financing, so they have \u20ac600 million of term debt, average duration of about nine years sub 3% and they will be internally generating about \u20ac82 million to \u20ac90 million of cash flow with really no requirements other than for growth. So in terms of doing an IPO at this juncture, not sure what we would use the proceeds on since they funded all their acquisitions and they're sitting on \u20ac70 million, \u20ac80 million of cash at this juncture. Longer term going forward, that will depend on market conditions, growth opportunity those kinds of things. Smedes Rose : Okay. Could I just ask you too, we keep saying a lot of media storage pop up about potential changes to proposition 13, particularly related to commercial property versus residential? Do you -- just being out there and maybe being more [indiscernible] in some of us, sorry, do you have -- can you add any color to that in terms of what you think could happen there if anything? Ron Havner : Well, I can't tell you what might happen, but as far as, we know there is no pending legislation or bills in California. But I don't know at the moment what is being introduced. We haven't heard anything to give concern at this juncture. Smedes Rose : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : Yes. Hi. You said Europe is strong. Could you share operational occupancy and rent data for European portfolio? Ron Havner : Sure. The same-store portfolio for Europe operated at 90.1% for the quarter, that's up from 84.9% last year, so 6% increase in occupancy. Realized rents were down a point and half, so revenue growth is about 4.5%, 4.6% and at quarter end the portfolio occupancy was 91.1%. All the markets across Europe were up in occupancy year-over-year. The strongest being in the Holland which closed out at quarter 87.5% versus 76% last year, so 15% growth, but if you recall Holland has been a challenge for us over the last couple of years, so it is obviously recovering and catching up with the rest of Europe. Gaurav Mehta : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Ron Havner : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Good afternoon. If we could first focus on profit margins for the quarter in the U.S., saw a nice improvement there? Can you discuss, I guess, the declines in advertising, selling expense and R&M, what we should expect maybe going forward the next couple quarters or even into \u201916? John Reyes : Yeah. Jeff, this is John. On the advertising, the advertising was down in the quarter, primarily because we didn't do television advertising in this second quarter versus last year where we did do about, I think, about a $0.5 million of advertising. We also spent a little less on the key search terms on the Internet. I think that was down maybe a couple hundred thousand dollars there. Going forward on the advertising, I would expect that it\u2019s probably going to be relatively flat Q3 and into Q4, because we probably go back on to television in those quarters similar to what we did last year. As per the R&M, I think it's really -- it's down but it\u2019s mostly I think timing, I think, we're expecting for the full year that R&M will be relatively flat. So there should be a little bit of an uptick in the latter half this year. Jeff Spector : Okay. Great. And then, I know that each quarter we asked about occupancy in the business, your portfolio as a whole for all self storage keeps rising at national levels. I mean, any new thoughts on full occupancy levels to your portfolio even just in general for self storage industry? Ron Havner : Is your question, what we think we possibly achieve, like what is the maximum occupancy level? Is that the question? Jeff Spector : Yeah. Basically and of course, I would assume that's based on what you're seeing in your markets in general? Ron Havner : Yeah. We have a couple of markets, our better performing markets in the quarter like Denver and Portland that had -- I think that ran about 97% almost 98% occupancy for the quarter. So you can say nationwide, so we possible achieve that where you have every market was hitting on all cylinders. But more likely than not, is there some strong markets, some average markets and some weak markets. So that might be tough to achieve on a national basis. For instance, right now, our DC, Norfolk Virginia markets are languishing a little bit. At the Midwest, it\u2019s not nearly as strong as the West Coast. So to say 2000 portfolio will operate at 90%, probably pretty hard. Having said that, we\u2019re about 96% today. Jeff Spector : Okay. Thanks. And then last question on the supply front, I know the last time I saw your team, we discussed the competition for land with departments, anything thereon on competition for site, anything on the supply front to share with us, any anything more recent from June, July? Ron Havner : While I think our main competitors for sites are multifamily, not really retail. Some storage guys although once in a while we run into a storage guy competing for the site but it\u2019s mainly the multifamily. In terms of supply nationwide, we think it\u2019s picking up. If you look at our development pipeline as a percentage of our portfolio, it\u2019s about 2.7%. So maybe you can extrapolate that in the industry and say the industry is growing at 2.7% as a whole. So that 1000, 1200 properties. Growth is not uniform across the country though. It\u2019s occurring where you would expect Texas, Florida, the Carolinas. The positive of those markets is they have above average population growth. It\u2019s not occurring to any significant degree in San Francisco, L.A., Boston, Miami, the markets which are much more challenging to get zoning and find sites to develop. Does that address your question? Jeff Spector : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of Keybanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Just -- I was wondering if you took a look at the SmartStop portfolio and if you did why you chose not to be as aggressive on the deal as your competitors, just given where your cost of capital fits? Ron Havner : Todd, we did look at the portfolio but I prefer not to answer that question. Todd Thomas : Okay. And thinking about your marketing platform and your digital footprint, how does the scalability factor in to your decision to buy properties and does it factor into the equation at all for PSA when you\u2019re looking to make new investments? Ron Havner : Certainly scale does. We look to increase our market share in our key markets where we operate. So if you look at our market like Florida, Miami, Fort Lauderdale. Over the past five, eight years, we've grown from about 14% market share to 25%, 28% market share. The same has happened in markets like Minnesota, Seattle, certainly in Dallas and Houston where we\u2019re building. Our market share is increasing there. So we very much focus our acquisition in our development program on expanding our platform in the key markets where we operate. And so that\u2019s certainly enters into our decision in terms of when you look at our portfolio like the one you just mentioned, there is a lot of tertiary markets there where we have no product and in a number of cases, we have no interest in having a new product. So it doesn't do much for the platform. Certainly scale in markets is very important. John can touch on the marketing side of it and the pricing side of it and scale in terms of operating efficiency, managerial talent, brand awareness. Here in L.A., we often have analyst come through and say, jeez you guys are everywhere here in L.A. and we are here in everywhere in L.A. We dominate the market and it\u2019s 200 plus property. So that's great for brand awareness and in television advertising and marketing. You want to add anything? John Reyes : No, I don\u2019t want to add anything. Todd Thomas : Okay. Ron Havner : Does that answer your question? Todd Thomas : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. Just a follow-up then on, selling and advertising expense, it was down nearly 10% but it was still about $5.5 million in the quarter. And just thinking about where occupancy is, why is that not down more? I would think that you could pare that back a bit more? John Reyes : We\u2019re doing everything we can to pare it back. Even though our occupancies remain high, we still had over 2000 tenants move out during the quarter. So we still have to advertise to replace those tenants and maintain the occupancy level. So if people stop moving out, I can guarantee you will cut down that advertising cost quite a bit. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Ki Bin Kim : Dennis, it\u2019s a follow-up on that previous question. As you\u2019re approaching 96% -- I guess, you hit 96% in July. It\u2019s unlike -- what point do you think it drove sufficiently high enough and I know you\u2019ve been pushing rates already but maybe push harder? When does that equation can start to favor pushing the rate level much more than just keeping occupancies higher? John Reyes : The problem that happens when you start pushing rate too high is you will get a tenant that you probably have to continue to provide the dollar special discount, and/or you will get a tenant that will not be a very long-term tenant. So, it's not necessarily -- the game is not won on the move-in rate. The game is won on getting the tenant that stays long and becomes very sticky to rate increases. Although we are pushing rate could we get more aggressive? Absolutely. We would lose occupancy and we would get a tenant that would not stay as long. And that's not in our strategy. Ron Havner : They key to follow-on on that, for the quarter, percentage of customers greater than one year was up 60 basis points to 55.9%, up from 55.3%. So if you had a chart in front of you last three years, you would see each quarter and year-over-year, we are moving that percentage of customers greater than one year up. And that really tends to -- goes to John\u2019s comment in terms of filling that base of stable customers that are somewhat of an sticky annuity. Ki Bin Kim : And the second question. When you are talking to, which I\u2019m assuming you are -- lot of the big operators outside of five public companies now. How have the conversations evolved in terms of their willingness to sell, kind of -- the bid-ask spread between what they want versus what you are willing to pay for assets? Has that gotten -- you are trying to put a measuring stick to it, more feasible to do bigger deals or still tough as before? Ron Havner : Well, usually the dynamic in the larger portfolio is not per se question of price. At this juncture, it\u2019s more a question of ownership dynamics, connecting the families that can be partners. That can be that other alternatives to selling, just simply refinancing because it\u2019s not hard to refinance a full stable portfolio at this juncture. So there is a lot of alternatives to the more established operators besides just selling and/or price. There is other dynamics within the ownership going up besides just do you want to sell or do you not want to sell. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yeah. Just wondered if you can comment on what the insurance participation rate was at the end of the quarter and then also if there is any update you can provide on any of the ongoing loss to the legal fees, whether it\u2019s pertaining to tenant insurance or what other matters that may have been resolved that you can comment on? Ron Havner : So your first question was how much -- was your question how much of the portfolio was covered by insurance or customer base, or what\u2019s the tenant insurance rates for new customers? George Hoglund : What part of the existing portfolio? Ron Havner : George. So, approximately 66% to 68% of our tenants have the tenant -- participate in the tenant reinsurance program that is offered at our properties. In terms of the G&A, this part quarter, G&A was up about $5.5 million and about $3.2 million of that were related to increased legal costs and it\u2019s for various matters out there. And we are not going to go through what those matters are on this call. George Hoglund : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hey. It\u2019s Ross Nussbaum here with Jeremy. Can you talk a little bit about the topic of move-ins versus move-outs? What was the percentage increase or decrease year-over-year for each of those stats in Q2? John Reyes : Yeah. This is John. So the move-ins were down about 1% of the move-in rate. The rental rates that they came in at was up about 8% for the quarter. On the move-outs, the moved-outs were about flat year-over-year. The rate -- the contract rate or the rental rate that they retain was up about 4.5%. Does that answer your question? Ross Nussbaum : Yeah, it does. I asked this question of extra space as well. I\u2019m trying to think of -- how should we'll be thinking about the fact that move-ins are down year-over-year yet the industries enjoying such significant occupancy and pricing pressure? Should we be considering all without that number? John Reyes : I can\u2019t speak about other people\u2019s move-in volumes and whether they are up or down. But what I could tell you with respect to ours, with their occupancy as high as they are and our occupancy spread being higher than last year, we have less inventory to sell. So notwithstanding the fact that our absolute numbers of moving volume is down, the velocity of move-ins, the move-ins relative to what we have to sell as a percentage is up quite a bit. So, I mean, if you took it to an extreme and we were 100% occupied, we would have no move-ins, right. So, closer we get to 100% occupied, it's very difficult to get move-in volumes on a year-over-year basis to increase. So, we are quite comfortable with the move-ins. We are still getting a lot of -- unfortunately, we're getting a lot of demand into our system, the demand, the call volume, the hits to our website, our website of both mobile and desktop are still way up. Part of our problem is that we have -- we are running into capacity issue in terms of inventory. Ron Havner : Ross for the quarter, even though the move-in volume was down about 2000 customers and the move-outs were about flat, we still had 21,800 net customers for the quarter. That\u2019s less than last year when we had 24,000 net customers. But to John\u2019s point, we still had on that 21,000 more people move-in to move-out during the quarter. Ross Nussbaum : Got it. Okay. Ron, look, strategically you talked about the Shurgard European IPO in the works. You and I have talked in the past about PS Business Parks. And while you\u2019re talking earlier, I was just pulling up a relative chart of PSA versus PSB over basically any timeframe you want to put out from year-to-date to 20 years. And PSA has been kicking PSBs, but from a relative share price performance. I guess what\u2019s it going to take ultimately to spin those shares off to shareholders and what your existing shareholders say if they want them be invest in self-storage, let them surely invest in self-storage. And if they like PSB, they can hold those shares. Ron Havner : Well, Ross, step back couple of things. First of all, if you -- self-storage is a completely different business than flex industrial. So that\u2019s one. Two, PSB is about 4% of our NOI enterprise value whatever you want to call it. Three, if for us to change our attitude on doing anything with PSB in terms of spinning off or sign it, there would be need to be a change in the tax law such that we would not pay any taxes on that, because most of our interest are held in OP units, which have quite frankly a de minimis tax basis. And so whatever we did with it, we for the most part be purely taxable income and in that requiring a distribution. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. Yes, that last point is interesting. Okay. I think Jeremy has got a question. Jeremy Metz : Hey, just one quick for me. Obviously you took -- it looks like 10 Houston assets are the same-store pool. Can you just talk about what\u2019s going on with those and what kind of costs you\u2019re looking at to get them back online just given that you\u2019re self-insured? Thank you. Ron Havner : While there were flooded, there were some pretty severe weather in Houston in the Q2. They\u2019re poorly damaged and so we took them out of the same-store pool because they will require extensive repairs. And on tenant insurance business, we had about $800,000 additional cost for estimated claims related to those properties. And in terms of our final estimate of how much it\u2019s going to cost to repair, we don\u2019t have that, that\u2019s still under process. My guess is it would be a couple million dollars. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, thanks. We saw that Shurgard issued the bond to fund their Netherlands acquisition. And Ron, you noted that they are generating free cash flow. But just as a reminder, is there a commitment in place for Public Storage to provide capital to Shurgard, just get a reminder what the commitment is if any? Ron Havner : No, Shurgard operates as a standalone entity. We own 49% of it, a large pension fund owns 51% of it, the other 51% and Shurgard has taken quite a while to get here, but Shurgard is self-funding. And as I noted and it issued the bonds, the \u20ac600 million bonds without any credit support from either of the two shareholders. Todd Stender : But nothing in writing to say you would commit equity to a large acquisition or anything like that? Ron Havner : No. Todd Stender : Okay. Thanks. And then just to look at an update of your current expectations, your same-store pool continues to generate accelerating fundamentals at this point in the cycle. Any updated thoughts on what it takes to say stabilize new development and C/O deals, anything that you\u2019ve revised anything internally as we enter August here? Ron Havner : Well, internally we continue to use our historical underwriting assumptions of generally about three years for a standard size property. If it\u2019s above average size, say like Gerard property, I believe we used four years. So for 2000 plus unit property, we used the four-year stabilization period. The nice thing is we are exceeding those by quite a bit. We opened a new facility here in Glendale about 2000 units at the end of April and it\u2019s already have 50% occupied in about two months. So that\u2019s a quite incredible, that\u2019s a combination of, it\u2019s a great product, the marketing team, the internet marketing team highlighting that facility, the pricing team pricing it to sell, and then of course operational execution at the unit level. Todd Stender : Is that causing you to accelerate your underwriting as you look at stuff that may close in the second half of this year? Ron Havner : Accelerate, you mean accelerate development faster? Todd Stender : Your expectations of stabilization? Ron Havner : I think we will be -- all of our stuff that\u2019s in the pipeline now filling up. Todd Stender : I guess new deals. Ron Havner : We are well ahead on across the board in terms of financials. John Reyes : We are not changing our underwriting. Ron Havner : No, we are not changing our underwriting. Todd Stender : Okay. So still three years. Ron Havner : We continue to underwrite it conservatively to keep the discipline on what we\u2019re developing. Todd Stender : Okay. Thank you, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Hi. Sticking with development for a second, it looks like right now the pipeline is $450 million to $500 million for development and expansion. Two questions, one, does it feel like over the near term that\u2019s a good run rate for the size of the pipeline? And then secondly, if you didn\u2019t start anything new, how long does it take you to complete those developments to bring them online? Ron Havner : Mike, I think we are -- the team has got their track shoes on and they are going around the track about as fast as they can with respect to the development team. They are doing a great job. And keep in mind in terms of the development pipeline, you\u2019ve got stuff delivering right. So we\u2019ve got product like the Glendale property delivered in Q2, so that comes out of the pipeline and so you got to backfill that just to kind of run in place at $500 million or $480 million. So there's a continuous in out process on that pipeline of deliveries and the new projects coming into it. So I wouldn't anticipate much more, that number going much above $500 million, certainly not within the next six to 12 month. In terms of what we've got under construction and how long, it will be pretty much third, fourth quarter of '16 before that's all built in out of the ground and up and operating and then you can figure two years after that before it stabilize. So think in '18 before what we're working on now get stabilized. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. John, as you just kind of parse through the rent data, I guess, can you kind of hit on my question? But I\u2019m just trying to think if you see anything kind of in the data as it relates to rent increases, pushback from customers, anything kind of by region, maybe by demographic profile of the center, just anything that you could sort of share with us about kind of the elasticity of demand here? Ron Havner : Yes. Steve, we do look at that, we look it by markets, by demographics. We aren\u2019t seeing anything different than what we saw last year, so they\u2019re behaving the same for the most part. So we\u2019re continuing to send out those increases just the same strategy as we have last year. We probably year-to-date have spent out about 5% or more increases and the percentage increases about the same as last year, which is about 9% to 10%. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. And then Ron, I know we\u2019ve talked a little bit about sort of your funding strategy and your maybe desire to expand your capital sources. And you are sort of contemplating the unsecured bond market. Just kind of what the status today, I realize you're largely self-funding unless maybe something large comes along? But is there any even thought process to doing some longer data debt and we even have an opportunity to maybe call in some of the preferreds and new kind of a swap there? Ron Havner : Steve, we are certainly looking at that. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if before the year it\u2019s done that we haven\u2019t kept into some form of debt. I\u2019ve mentioned the last time we\u2019ve been looking at private placement as well as public debt. We\u2019ve looked at various maturity levels, which certainly long-dated maturities also. And we do have a few series of preferred stock, one becomes callable in the fourth quarter of this year. And I think we have two larger series that become callable next year, so definitely on in my mind. And I think you might see something happen before the end of the year. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is a follow-up from Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Ron, I want to just come back on development. So, 2.7% outstanding today relative to your stock and I think you commented that used as a good proxy for the rest of the industry. And I guess from the delivery standpoint, I think you said most of what\u2019s underdevelopment today is going to deliver by the end of 2016? Or do you think some of what gets pushed from a completion standpoint at the '17? Ron Havner : No. Michael, I think most of what in the projects that I kind of used the 60 properties, either under construction or about to start construction. We\u2019re pretty close to getting the deal tie down. I would anticipate that those will be constructed by the end of 2016, a good chunk balance of this year, first half of next year but it will dribble out through 2016. So if you take that 60 properties, we\u2019re 5% of the industry say, so that\u2019s about 1200 properties nationwide, right. 100 million to 120 million square feet, it\u2019s not occurring at all, but all the uniformity they\u2019ll cross the country. Where we\u2019re developing, where we see other people developing the most of markets where you'd expect, Texas, Florida, Arizona, we\u2019re not developing anything in the Midwest but their stuff going on there. Where's development not or it\u2019s de minimis Los Angeles, San Francisco, Downtown Seattle, Downtown Miami, Boston where it\u2019s very challenging to get sites. You\u2019re competing with the high-rise residential guys where there is simply not available, land available to build self-storage. So it\u2019s not uniform across the country. But if you can take our portfolio, our development is a percentage of our portfolio and where we are in the industry. 2.5%, 3% industry expansion doesn't sound unreasonable. That compares with the kind of the Canada growth rate, which I talked about on previous calls, of U.S, population growth which is somewhere between 0.8% and 1% across the country. Again, population growth is not uniform. It\u2019s higher in markets like Texas, Florida, Arizona, so maybe the product coming on there can be absorbed by the above average population growth. Michael Bilerman : Do you feel like the rest of the industry is accelerating development faster than you as more capital comes into the system and they see the good fundamentals and so, while you maybe developing 2.7% of your base. As we move over the next 12 months that 2.7 is going to expect at least double from the last 12 month but it doubled again and rise to 5% of the stock as we go into \u201817 and \u201818? Ron Havner : I don\u2019t want to rule out any possibility. Certainly the opportunity for developer to do what is referred to as the C of O deals with pretty much the other public companies are offering to buy properties newly developed, take away the fill-up risk, the operational risk and from what we\u2019ve observed, pay close to retail prices on that. That\u2019s certainly a very, very strong incentive if you\u2019re a local or regional developer for you to build and sell product and into the public market be as a C of O deals. What that does to the volume, I don't know. And does our percentage reflective of the industry or maybe we start development a couple years ago, so maybe we\u2019re at low ahead of the curve. But our feeling here, our observation is certainly development is accelerating, most regional and local operators that we talk to are all developing whether it\u2019s one project or five. Lot of people are developing product. Michael Bilerman : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Omotayo Okusanya : My questions have actually been answered. Thank you. Operator : Next question is a follow-up from Todd Thomas of Keybanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Hi, guys. It\u2019s Jordan Sadler here with Todd. Just a follow up on your last comment there regarding folks paying, I guess, your competitors paying retail for the C of O deals in your retail. How would you define retail versus wholesales or what do you think that is the premium level of the cost? Ron Havner : 150%, its varies Jordan. I mean, I don\u2019t have any information to say what we just -- we can look at what we're building for per foot approximately and see some of these deals and go. Okay, that is about 150% to 200% of what we\u2019re building for those market. Jordan Sadler : That's interesting. Okay. And I have a totally separate question which is just, regarding dividend policy. Can you speak to I mean historically over the years I feel like you guys have try to maintain your dividend to add that taxable net income essentially. But by the same token as this is your portfolio had seasoned and your leverage had decline relative to the size, the overall portfolio your payout ratios have climbed. I think it peaked in the last cycle, you were probably paying out less than 50% of cash flow as a dividend. And today we\u2019ve got you in low 80s or something like that. Can you speak to that at all and are there any strategies that you can employ besides sort of maybe levering up, where you would be able to sort of reduce that and is that on your mind? Ron Havner : Jordan, if you -- let's go back to the kind of middle of your question, you start to where we at the 2008-2009 kind of the great recession that we were at 50% payout, why where we that low? While we had done the Shurgard merger in 2006 and if you recall that was about $5.5 billion deal. We structured that, even though it was all stock as a taxable transaction. So, which was very important to us, so we picked up a lot of tax basis in that transaction in one shot. In addition, a lot of the merger costs and option exercise costs and severance costs we waited till the deal closed. And so we\u2019ve got a lot of tax benefits from that transaction in \u201806, \u201807 or \u201808 which helps to keep our -- our earnings were growing, our payout wasn't changing and so the spread between earnings and payout got very low to your comment. As time has gone on, the portfolios continued to improve, we\u2019ve delevered and some of those tax benefits have burned off to where we\u2019re -- basically, our payout is still at a taxable income. That strategy has not changed in 25 years is still our taxable income. But as the portfolios grown, we are only able to retain $250 million, $300 million a year. So as the earning basis is growing, that has reduced our percentage of retaining cash flow. The absolute numbers about the same but percentage wise, therefore our payout ratios has gone up. John, you want to? In terms of -- if we did leverage, would that help us, if it was positive leverage it would probably exacerbate the problem. John Reyes : And the other thing, George, as we just recently increased our dividend, so we increased it to a level that we think will sustain us probably for another year. So right now what you're seeing is that 80% that you threw out will probably get down into the 70s. So it's not -- you're looking at, I think for one quarter because we just bumped it this past quarter. But it'll get back down into 70s again. So, you are looking at the front end of that dividend increase relative to the current earnings. What we did is projected out earnings for the next 12 months and came up with that dividend level. So, I think you\u2019ll see it come back a little bit more in line but it\u2019s not going back down to 50%. I think it\u2019s probably -- we pretty much hit the wall in terms of, I think what we can do to reduce taxable income. So, I think that\u2019s where you are going to see our payout ratio for the foreseeable future. Jordan Sadler : That\u2019s helpful. Does that factored at all when you're underwriting an acquisition, the ability to sort of utilize that depreciation and maintain that cash flow because on your base it's obviously pretty significant. John Reyes : Well, each acquisition is about the same percentage of land, building, and a depreciable life with 29, 30 years. Jordan Sadler : Yeah. I meant more like portfolio or entity level acquisition. John Reyes : You mean when we go to do something, similar to Shurgard where we can get a large all stocked taxable transaction? Ron Havner : Yeah. Well. It would be nice but\u2026 Jordan Sadler : Is that a piece of the equation as you look at portfolio and you look at M&A, looking at this potential free cash flow and freeing up this monstrous free cash flow, you get a tax benefit of. Ron Havner : Let me go back to the Shurgard transaction. So the way that was structured is -- what are the underlying cash flows, what\u2019s the underlying real estate and how much real estate value are we giving up by issuing 20% of our stock, 25% of our stock in exchange for the Shurgard assets? So that was the way we structured the deal, the pricing we came up with the deal. We didn't factor in synergies and we didn't factor in the tax attributes. Those things were icing on the cake. And to take care of the things that we didn't know about in the transaction. But so our underwriting on real estate, the way we think about it, what markets, sub markets, really goes to that question I answered earlier about our strategy of building presence and dominance in markets, building and buying A and B locations, the tax side of it is not part of that underwriting analysis in terms of what we'll pay for something of our view on the quality of the real estate. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call to Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clem Teng : Thank you all for your attendance this afternoon and your questions. We\u2019ll speak to you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s Public Storage second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio Webcast replay of this conference call on our Web site at www.publicstorage.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Ron. Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem. And welcome everyone to the third-quarter call. We had a pretty solid quarter across all of our businesses. And our West Coast properties in particular, Denver, West, performed particularly strong this quarter, and in the makeup, a pretty good size of our portfolio. But overall it was a great quarter across all of our businesses. With that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : Ron, can you talk about your performance in Europe for the quarter? Ron Havner : Sure. Europe had a great quarter. It would have translated into a really good quarter for us were it not for the currency. But operating fundamentals were excellent. Same-store NOI in Europe was up 8.8%, led by the Netherlands, which was up 13.9% year-over-year. Occupancy for the period was 91%, up from 86.5% last year, so solid quarter in Europe. And then we did a couple of portfolio acquisitions, so I think overall NOI in Europe was up 15%, 16%. Gaurav Mehta : Okay. And one more, if I may, what was the peak occupancy for your U.S. portfolio in the quarter? Ron Havner : You mean which months? Gaurav Mehta : Yes, or how much. Ron Havner : For the quarter we peaked at July at 95.5%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : I don't want to get hung up on one quarter but when I look at the performance that you guys put up on same-store revenue, 10 basis points deceleration from last quarter. Not a big deal. But when I compare it relative to your peers that reported, the other guys were able to reaccelerate or continue acceleration this quarter. Just curious what your thoughts were on why your portfolio didn't reaccelerate? Ron Havner : This is Ron. I thought we had an exceptionally good quarter. Comparing us to others is a little hard, both because of geography mix as well as what people put in their same-stores versus what we put in our same-stores. So, it's a little apples and bananas. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And can you give me a quick update on what your street rates were this quarter in terms of year-over-year? John Reyes : I'll tell you what our movement rates were up by because that's more important than street rates. Street rates, the move-in rates were up about 5% year-over-year -- 5.3% actually, our move-ins, just to add a little bit more to that were up about 1% with higher move-in rates by about 5.3%. Ki Bin Kim : I see. It seems a little bit lower than last quarter's 8% number. Any particular reason why? John Reyes : Last year we also had less move-ins, too. We had about 1% less move-ins with an 8% increase in move-in rates. I would say the second quarter was by far a very strong quarter for us. Third quarter was a great quarter, too, but not as strong, I think, as what we saw in the second quarter. The other thing that happened in the third quarter is we spent about 20% less in marketing costs. So, we didn't spend nearly as much as we spent last year on both the Internet on search terms as well as on television. So, that doesn't show up on the top line. It shows up in the expense line. But nonetheless, pretty happy that we got a 1% increase in move-ins with about 5.3% increase in rate without doing nearly as much marketing as we did last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : During the quarter it looks like only two property acquisitions closed and you had a little bit of a larger pipeline at the end of last quarter. Is this just because most of those deals are C of O deals yet to close, or is there any sort of delay in closing deals going on? Ron Havner : No, they weren't C of O deals. The challenge with them is they had debt assumptions, CMBS debt assumptions, which, if you've ever done one of that, that's like getting a tooth extracted. So, it's taken a little longer to close. But I think we've got 10 or 11 queued up to close in Q4. George Hoglund : And then just one other thing, just in terms of the debt issuance, you guys doing the private placement in euro denominated. But going forward, would you guys also be looking to do a U.S. dollar denominated issuance if you guys have a use for the proceeds? Ron Havner : Probably, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask you, looking through the first nine month you've done an amazing job at keeping the total cost down, only up 1.3%, the cost of operating the properties. And as you look into next year, what are the key areas where you might be seeing more pressure? I would imagine property tax is one of them but are there any others that you see any particular upticks? Ron Havner : Smedes, I think property taxes, they were up 6.1% for the quarter on our same-store properties, 5.1% year to date. That will continue to be a challenge. John can elaborate on that. Payroll will probably be 2% to 3%. We've enjoyed for the last two or three years declining advertising Internet cost because the portfolio's been full. We've been able to extend customer duration. So, we just have not needed to spend as much on promotion. I would be surprised if that number continues to decline in 2016. And then the other categories, I'd just assume a general inflation rate. Quarter to date, for the quarter our advertising promotion was down 19% year to date. It's down 18%. And that's really contributed to the big decline or flat-lining of expenses. And again, I wouldn't expect that to continue, John, any comments on property taxes? John Reyes : Nothing in particular, we're all seeing that property taxes are going up. Many municipalities are becoming more and more aggressive. It's mostly on the valuation, at least with respect to our portfolio, reassessing the values. We do the best we can to push back on valuations, but it gets tougher and tougher and they're more aggressive out there. So, I expect that next year we could probably -- this year we're looking at about a 5% increase for the full fiscal year -- next year I wouldn't be surprised if that bumps up to about 6%. Smedes Rose : Okay. Could you just maybe -- you just mentioned length of stay or duration -- what is that now and how is that changing or how has it changed over the course of the year? Ron Havner : Sure. For the quarter we had 56.6% of our customers with us greater than a year. That is up from 55.8% at the same time last year, so 0.8% absolute increase in the percentage of customers greater than a year. To put that in perspective, in 2012 that number was 54.5%. If you could look at it over the last two or three years, each quarter, quarter over quarter and year-over-year we've been able to move the length of stay up, the percentage of customers, greater than a year. That translates into this year versus last year we've got 13,400 more customers greater than a year in the portfolio, a 2.2% improvement. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hi it's Ross here with Jeremy. Ron, you've been at this 20, 25-plus years. I'm pretty sure this is as good as you've ever seen it in the business. What's keeping you up at night? It looks like, at least for the time being, as we look ahead to 2016, there doesn't seem to be anything that's going to throw a wrench into the system. Other than the supply number ticking up, is there anything that worries you about the ability to maintain pricing power? Ron Havner : A couple things, Ross, new supply is coming and I believe it will continue to accelerate for all the right rational reasons. You can build far cheaper than you can buy. Operating fundamentals in the business are unbelievably good for a variety of reasons -- full employment, job creation, the economy's doing well, low interest rates. So, the fundamentals of the business are exceptional. You can get capital to build. So, new supply is coming and at some point that will start to impact people's pricing power. Simple supply and demand -- as more supply comes in that will impact pricing power. I don't see that being a big negative headwind at least for another year but it's coming. And then in terms of the economy, I can't predict the economy but the economy's been good. Things that hit the economy tend to be shocks, and then that disrupts the business environment, and then you start to have an uptick in unemployment and layoffs and all those things, which tend to not severely affect us but will slow growth down. So, that's probably on the horizon. But barring those, the fundamentals for our business are great because of the employment and the last four, five years, lack of new supply. Ross Nussbaum : Jeremy's got one. Jeremy Metz : I just had a quick one on discounts. It feels like the gains from the lower discounting may be largely behind us at this point. But I just wonder if you can give us an update on where they trend in 3Q relative to last year, and just how you're viewing discounting here going into the slower season. John Reyes : Jeremy, this is John. In terms of the number of tenants getting discounts during the third quarter, I think we were giving them to about 70% of the move-ins versus about, I think, 73% or 75% last year. But the absolute dollars of discounts are actually up because our rental rates are higher than that, than the percentage decrease in the absolute number. So, we are giving less but it's translating into more dollars because our rental rates are up. I think for the quarter our discounting, just to give you some numbers we gave away about $23 million of discounts. That's versus $22 million last year. So we're up about 5% there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Going back to Europe can you talk about any additional opportunities there? There's a bunch of smaller players. Clearly they don't have the platform you guys have or many of the other U.S. players have. Just if you could give us some sense of any incremental opportunity there you see. Ron Havner : Recall, there's only Western Europe, 1,600, 1,800 properties in all of Western Europe. I think 800 to 900 of them are in Great Britain and a lot of those are outside of London. And we don't really want to, in terms of Great Britain, go outside of London. So, a lot of those just don't come into our radar in terms of where we want to grow the portfolio. In several of the markets we have dominant share -- Stockholm, Belgium, 70%, 80% share of the market. In terms of the rest of Europe, there's probably a couple hundred million of stuff to do but not a lot. To give you some perspective, you take the city of Berlin, 3.5 million people where we acquired two properties earlier this year there are 15 self storage properties in Berlin with 3.5 million people. You have markets like that where clearly the opportunity is to develop versus acquire because there's really not much to acquire. So we're ramping up our development program in Europe. We were fortunate to get these two acquisitions. There may be, like I said, $100 million or $150 million more. But really the growth in Europe's going to come from development for us. Vikram Malhotra : And to clarify, you're looking to maybe develop some additional assets there? Ron Havner : Yes. We opened one in London this quarter and we've got two more coming out of the ground in the next six months. We've hired a person to help us in Germany, and in particular Berlin, so you should expect some development activity in that market next year. Vikram Malhotra : And just to clarify, your sense of what the heals are over there versus here in the US? Ron Havner : I haven't seen anything on paper yet but my guess is they'll be close to the US. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Just a follow-up to Jeremy's question, you ran through you the discounting in the quarter but I think you've previously talked about that as the overall customer acquisition cost. I was just wondering if you could share with us where that cost is today and how that's trended over the last year. Ron Havner : Sure. For the quarter, Todd, our marketing costs were down $1 million. Our discounts were up $800,000. So net-net, we were flat on promotional cost. Move-ins were up 1%, up 2,000, as John said. So our cost to acquire a customer went down $1 from $126 to $125. The move-in rate was up 5% or $7. The move-in fees were up $1. So net-net for each customer we made $35 upon move-in versus $26 last year. So, that's a 35% improvement in our customer acquisition cost for the quarter. Year-to-date numbers are somewhat comparable. We have a 31% improvement in customer acquisition costs from $26 to $34, again due to lower spend, greater volume, higher rates. Todd Thomas : Is 35 -- is that a peak for the portfolio? Ron Havner : In terms of profitability upon move-in? Todd Thomas : Sorry, is that the highest number -- yes -- the most profitable quarter that you've seen? Ron Havner : Since we've been tracking this, yes, our overall promotional and marketing cost, to put it in a different light for you, in 2011 we spent 9.2% of revenues on promotional discounts and marketing cost and year to date we're at 5.7%. Todd Thomas : And then just a question on development, it sounds like the C of O portfolios within the REIT portfolios are growing rather quickly here, and developers are bringing sites to the market and you're talking about new supply accelerating. What's happening to land prices? And is the competition for development impacting your ability to start new projects? Is the pipeline potentially going to thin out a little bit? Ron Havner : It hasn't so far but my guess, my expectation, is that it will change as development is ramped up and more people start to do it. But that really hasn't been an impediment for us. The thing that we are seeing is an uptick in construction cost and it's harder in some markets to get contractors available to perform the construction. Guys are building apartments and hotels and retail. So, the construction business is pretty good now, so we've seen a little more challenge on the labor contractor side and then an uptick in material cost. Again, not big enough to slow us down but we have seen that versus two years ago when we started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors. David Bragg : G&A saw another pretty large increase again this quarter. We assume that it's again driven by legal costs. Can you talk about when we should expect to receive more clarity on the nature of these costs? Ron Havner : There's legal fees, and in this quarter we booked a $3.5 million reserve for a proposed settlement. Dave, if you recall, in our 10-Q we break out in a fair amount of granularity the components of G&A. David Bragg : Yes, we've seen that. We'll look forward to it this quarter. Okay. And as far as you can see, the outlook for 2016 legal expenses relative to 2015, does it look like this will subside? Ron Havner : I hope so. David Bragg : Second question, although you've been pretty clear in recent quarters that you continue to pursue debt options, how about a commercial paper program, which a couple other very large REITs have pursued? Is that on your radar screen? Ron Havner : No. It's not even thinking that way. David Bragg : Okay. Last question is on property taxes. You talked about the outlook there. Relative to prior cycles, what's your view on the extent to which assessments are below market? And outside of California, is there any big variability? John Reyes : This is John, David. I think California's probably, as you pointed, because of Prop 13 is probably the biggest variable. I think most other states, depending on what you think market is or what assessors think market is, I think most of our properties are either assessed each year or every other year, at the worst. So, they're probably for the most part fairly close to market, but I'm guessing at that. I don't know because, again, I don't know what the assessors are looking at. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Going to development for a second, if you put aside a project like Gerard or something, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the time to lease up new developments today compared to underwriting? I guess per expansion that's really going to be a function of size. So, just on the new development side what you're seeing. Ron Havner : Yes, Mike, the new developments are leasing up much faster than we underwrite. Now, part of that's attributable to the fact that we're opening them with lower rates than we're underwriting and probably a few more discounts. We open a property here in Glendale in May, 2,000 units, it's about a mile and-a-half here from corporate headquarters, and it's already 72% occupied, which is phenomenal. We underwrote it for three-, three-and-a-half year fill-up. And that one's actually pretty chose in terms of rates that we underwrote. That's filling up at rates pretty close that we underwrote. In general, for developments, depending on the size of the property, we underwrite a three- to four-year fill-up and a reserve in terms of the cost to carry that property until it stabilizes. So, so far, knock on wood, developments are filling up much faster than anticipated. Michael Mueller : And then for the projects where you really cut the rent and fill it up, can you bring everybody to market the year after that or close to it, or do you have to stagger? What's the dynamic there? Ron Havner : It will take a couple of years. It depends on how far below quote market we brought them in at. So it will take a couple years of rental rate increases to get them close to market. And then once the property stabilizes, we'll bring the rents closer to market. So, it will take a couple of years of rent roll-up for it to get to the targeted or underwritten rental rate, in-place rents. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Hi, guys, I tried to hop out of the queue. I had a question on Glendale, which you successfully anticipated. Maybe I'll ask one more on the balance sheet. You mentioned not wanting to do commercial paper. But would the preference be for tenured debt or maybe even pushing it out to 30 years? What's the mindset on the debt market? John Reyes : Right now, yes, we've looked at 7, 10, 12, 15, 30 year debt. So right now, when we go out there and issue debt again, we'll probably look at how it's -- we want to properly tranche the debt so that we feel comfortable with future fill-up maturities. So, I think right now for us we're not ready to do another one but when we do we will look at the various maturity dates. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Just looking at the acquisitions, the two in Colorado, you have a few teed up to close, it looks like, in the near term, California, Florida and Texas, can you just talk about the difference in cap rates you're seeing, if there is any, really on a stabilized basis? Ron Havner : Todd, I don't think there's a material difference. For the most part, stuff is trading at trailing 4 to 5 yields on previous owners' NOI. And that seems to be the market or the market expectation. The thing that we, given that we pay a lot of attention to, is what is replacement cost and asset location. So, what do we think we can do in terms of rental rates and then how much does this property cost versus what does it cost to build, out of those 11 properties, 800,000 square feet, just over 800,000 square feet, you're at about $132 a foot, which is within plus/minus 5%, 10% of what we think we can build the properties for. Todd Stender : And any details on the MSAs you're buying in? Are these the top 25? And what's your appetite to go within the top 50? Ron Havner : We're finding the top 50. These particular properties fill in our portfolio nicely, both in terms of -- I think the Florida ones are primarily in Orlando and they fill in our Orlando franchise nicely, as well as the stuff in Dallas and Houston. So it's really, if you think of a market like Dallas or Houston or Orlando where we have anywhere between 50 and 100, 120 properties, we're really trying to do acquisitions that fill in the franchise, cover some markets where maybe we don't necessarily have product but we'd like to have product. Todd Stender : And then, finally, if you could just shed some light on how your underwriting assumptions, particularly for the Glendale property you said is leasing up at 72% occupied, how does that relate to what your underwriting yield was relative to how quickly you can lease it up? Ron Havner : Five months into it we would have underwritten about 20%, 24% occupancy. It's at 72%. So, even though the rates may be slightly low, the cash we're getting and the net cash flow, the property's already breaking even and generating a profit. We would have underwritten to not make a profit for six to nine months, so we're already net positive cash. It will take a couple of years, when it stabilizes, to really sit back and say what is the cash on cash return, and how much extra money do we make by filling up faster versus taking a more traditional approach of starting rates higher and filling it up slower. I'd also say that property is rather iconic and there is a lot of great things going on in Glendale. The market was undersupplied. So, there's another aspect of building the right product in the right submarket and certainly that property fits the bill there. Todd Stender : Great. Thank you. Ron Havner : Did that answer your question? Todd Stender : It certainly did. Thank you, Ron. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America. Jana Galan : A trend we're seeing in apartments currently is smaller MSAs are experiencing stronger rent growth than the larger markets. I was curious if you're seeing that in storage as well, or does rate and demand continue to be primarily driven by submarket density? Ron Havner : I'm looking here at the revenue growth for most of our markets. Our top revenue grower for the quarter was Portland at 15.7%, followed by Orlando at 13.5%, Sacramento at 13.8%. Nashville was 12.1%. Dallas was 11.9%, Houston was 11%. Does that give you a sense of things? The flip side is Philadelphia at 4.3%, DC at 3.2%, Chicago at 3.2%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hi, it's Ross again. Is there any thought of potentially using some equity funding here, given the potential run up in the stock this year? How are you thinking about cost of capital on the equity side relative to your alternatives? Ron Havner : Ross, I certainly like the stock price. It certainly reflects the great fundamental trends in our business. But one of the things you have to ask yourself is does it really make sense to issue equity when we have such an unlevered balance sheet. We did the euro deal at 2.7 or 2.17 and we can probably do a 10-year deal at sub-4%. Does it really make sense to go issue equity, John, do you have any other comments on that? John Reyes : No. You'd have to ask yourself what's the cost of capital of issuing common stock. There's growth -- I'm sure you're just looking at a cap rate of whatever you think it is trading at. For example, say you're saying it's a 4 cap rate. But it will probably grow somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.5%, 4% on an unlevered basis, which, in my mind, brings the cost of capital issuing common somewhere in the neighborhood of, call it, 6% to 7%, which, again, when you combine that with a de-levered balance sheet I think our first choice right now is to lever up the balance sheet with debt and fund our acquisitions and development programs with that method first going forward. That's not to say we won't issue equity for the right transaction. If the right transaction came along we'd certainly consider issuing equity. Ross Nussbaum : Is there any part of you that's ever thought about actually bringing the leverage of the Company up closer to, I would say, the REIT average, if you will -- so go out and do a multi-billion dollar debt issuance and just do a special dividend and just recapitalize the Company? Is there any thought to that? Ron Havner : Not at this time. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. And then the last follow-up I had, I drive by a number of your facilities quite often. Some of them look beautiful, spectacular, new, shiny, and some of them look 30-plus years old. Some of them have the toll free number on them some of them have the Internet site on them. Maybe can you talk a little about branding and consistency of branding and how important do you think that is going forward? When I drive by a McDonald's they're usually the same. I drive by a Public Storage increasingly they're not. Maybe talk a little bit about how much of an issue that is or is not. Ron Havner : Given our current occupancies I would say it's not too much of an impediment. The key for the branding are the orange doors and the name, Public Storage. And that is so dominant and so powerful, it's just unbelievable. We can talk for an hour about what it does for us on the Internet, customer awareness, et cetera. The point you raise in terms of the dichotomy of our, I'll call it, property image is certainly true. One of the things that we've been doing for several years is redeveloping properties. It's a little harder than you think because in many of those infill locations where you're probably driving by, self storage has been zoned out and we can't get the city to even reconsider redeveloping the property because they just as soon it wasn't there. If you're down in the Florida, there's a property down there in Aventura that we redeveloped. It took us four years to get that done. So, while we'd like to go through and change up the image of the properties and standardize it, it's a lot more challenging than on the surface. And combined with, there's a dichotomy in the portfolio because a lot of it's been acquired from other people that built it to different standards or different specs, so it's going to look different. That's also attributable to different zoning regulations. So, even some of the new stuff that we build, I think we've got one property where we can't have any orange on it. Not our choice but that's the zoning regulations. Ross Nussbaum : I think I drove by a blue one the other day. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Andrew Rosivach : Sorry to jump on at the end like this. A prior question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly, that obviously your G&A's been elevated, as you mentioned, because of the Q because of legal expenses, but that the primary case associated with those legal expenses has now been settled? Ron Havner : There's a reserve that we made in Q3 for about $3.5 million and it's a tentative settlement. We have other ongoing litigation. Andrew Rosivach : So I shouldn't presume that's the primary one. That's not the case? Because it just sounded like you could get some relief in the legal expenses going forward. Ron Havner : The question was will they be lower next year and I said I hope so. Andrew Rosivach : I hope so. Yes. That's the other items, the $0.02 that's sitting in your FFO? John Reyes : That's correct. Operator : With our final question, I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clem Teng : I want to thank everybody for attending our call this morning and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Bye. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Ronald Havner : Thank you, Clem. We had a pretty good fourth quarter in 2015. So, we're happy to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. My question is just looking at your property manager payroll and supervisory payroll, these line items, combined, came in \u2013 it looks like about 1% for the full year in terms of total increases and you guys always do a good job with keeping those payroll numbers fairly low in terms of percentage of increases. But I do think about 2016, is that sustainable keeping it at that pace or what kind of increases would you expect maybe going forward? John Reyes : Smedes, I would say you should probably expect between 2% and 3%. Smedes Rose : That high? John Reyes : Yes. Well, I mean, you've got the supervisory payroll up the year for 1.9%, we relied a few district managers in 2015, so we'll fill in the bench there. Onsite property manager payroll, I'm looking, 0.6%. That will probably be up 1% to 1.5%, would be my guess. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then, can I just ask you \u2013 you did the acquisition activity, thus far, in the first quarter, it looks like almost as much as you did for the full year in 2015. Can you share maybe what kind of yields you're buying out or maybe any thoughts on kind of just the pricing that you're seeing now versus what you were seeing last year or availability of product? Because it seems like it's accelerated quite a bit from what you have done last year. John Reyes : Yeah. I wouldn't read too much into that. I think last year, we were a little light on volume. Pricing has, for the most part, gotten away from us. The transactions that we see \u2013 a lot of transactions we see in the marketplace, which is it doesn't work in terms of what we're looking or in terms of returns, or value per foot. And that was pretty much the case last year, and I would say it's continued into this year. We get deals here and there. And so that's why the volumes are $100 million, $150 million. Smedes Rose : All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. For Ron, as you look into next year or this year, and next year, do you see anything on the horizon that you can point to that would suggest or make that 6% realized rent growth or contract rent growth number you posted this year to slow down at all? Ronald Havner : Well, Ki, I've been saying for the last couple of quarters, and I think it's true, eventually the uptick in new supply, number of properties being constructed, will have an impact on rental rates or realized rents per foot. When that takes place, I don't know. Is it back half of this year? Is it 2017 or 2018? I don't know. The new supply stats are kind of a best guess. My best guess is we probably got 1,000 to 1,200 properties under construction in the U.S. And that's probably 2%, 2.5%, which is close to three times population growth. The flip side of that is that new supply is not coming in, in all markets. And so the markets with the greater-than-average supply growth, unless the population is flowing there, will have rental rates impacted sooner rather than later. But when that takes place, I don't know. It will happen, though. I mean, its economics, supply and demand. And so as that supply comes on, it will impact our ability to price product. Ki Bin Kim : And you said, 2.5% of that coming on line. How much of that is in your market when you look at it, not from areas where you're not in, but just where you're competing at? Ronald Havner : Well, the new supply usually comes in in a market where it is easier to build, so Texas and Florida. The bros of New York have had a number of projects under construction for a while, big projects. So, I'd focus on those markets in terms of new supply. The flipside of that is Florida and Texas have great population close to them, so they can handle above-average supply growth. We're not seeing a lot of stuff here in California or really on the West Coast to speak up. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America. Jana Galan : Hi. I was wondering if you could talk to kind of just operations during the slower winter months use of concessions and what you saw \u2013 and I think I was surprised the occupancy held up stronger than prior fourth quarters. John Reyes : Hi Jana, this is John. The occupancy continued to hold up, we did some television advertising in Q4. As we did it in Q4 last year. I don't think it was as effective though as we saw on the prior years. But nonetheless, I think the demand was still there but not as strong as we were hoping. Our move-in volumes were up about 0.9% and people are moving in at rates that were approximately 4% higher. But overall, I was very pleased, I think the demand coming into our systems, either through the call center or the websites, continues to be strong. I think our biggest problem right now is really having the available space to rent and to satisfy that demand. So, we'll keep working on that as we move forward. Demand continues to be strong year-to-date for the first month-and-a-half of this year. So, things still look pretty good right now. Jana Galan : And just in terms of any geographic variance, are you still kind of experiencing stronger rent growth and occupancies on the West Coast markets? John Reyes : West Coast is definitely our strongest markets, regions. The Midwest and I would say the Great Lakes markets are probably the weakest right now, the Chicago market, the Milwaukee market, Minneapolis, down into St. Louis. Florida is doing very well. Most of Texas is doing well. The Carolinas also doing well. We're a little weak in the D.C. market, the Baltimore market. But other than that, most of the other markets are doing pretty good. Jana Galan : Thanks, John. John Reyes : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Just thinking about fundamentals in the current environment and your operating strategy here in the New Year with the peak leasing season approaching, do you think that your customer acquisition costs will continue to improve in 2016? I think last quarter you said you profited $35 per move-in in the first month. That was net of marketing and discounts, and that was a peak since you began tracking that much. Do you think that you can improve upon that in 2016? John Reyes : Hold on. We'll get that. The short answer, Todd, is yes because I think Street rates will be higher in 2016 than 2015. We probably won't do as much advertising and we'll be mindful upholding customer volumes, so net-net, to reduce your marketing cost, rates go higher and you hold volumes and the customer profitability will go up. In Q4, our profit was about $27 per customer versus $19, so we were up 42% in terms of customer profitability in Q4. For the year, we were up about 33%. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then, just following up on, I think, the prior question, you said that the TV advertising was not as effective in the fourth quarter. Any reason why that you can point to explain that? John Reyes : Todd, no, I can't explain it. It's one of the things we just never really know how markets are going to react. It would be weather, it could be people busy doing something else, not paying attention. Maybe \u2013 we just don't know. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hey. Good morning to you, guys. Ronald Havner : Hey, Ross. Ross Nussbaum : Ron, can you talk about how the fourth quarter played out to what your expectations were? And in particular, as you all know, the retailers had a tough calendar fourth quarter because of the warm winter weather, so people weren't buying jackets. But I'd imagine it probably meant that they might have been getting out of their houses more to do things like use self-storage. Do you think the winter weather played into your favor in the fourth quarter? John Reyes : From a revenue management standpoint, I think... Ronald Havner : Yeah. I think... John Reyes : I think it came in where we thought. Ronald Havner : Yeah. I think we were \u2013 there was no surprise, Ross, in terms of demand into the system, the rental rates that we were getting. A lot of our properties aren't really \u2013 still the West Coast is still doing very well, which is really driving a lot of this. And I don't think the West Coast is subject to weather changes as maybe the East Coast is. John Reyes : And Ross, move-in volume in Q4 was up 0.9%. The move-out volume was up 1.7%. Recall last year in the fourth quarter, pretty harsh winter. So, my guess is people were maybe unable to get out of their storage facilities, so maybe that's why we had an uptick in volume. But we still had positive flows on the insight. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. Second question. Can you talk a little bit about to what extent you're using targeted online advertising such as Facebook? And I think about when I travel to Los Angeles, right, Mark Zuckerberg somehow knows I'm in Los Angeles and starts sending me LA-based business ads. Are you guys doing that in any fashion and thinking about shifting more of your spend away from TV towards targeted online and embracing that channel a little more? Ronald Havner : Well, I would say this, we do spend \u2013 we actually spend more money on online, advertising either through keywords search bids or banner advertising than we do on television advertising. Television has really come down in terms of our spend. Much of our dollars are now being spent on online. In terms of what you're referring to in terms of using, I guess, social media to do things, we certainly are thinking about things like that. I don't want to tell you that we are doing things like that at the moment, but certainly something that we're constantly exploring thoughts on how we can attract the customer and a better customer, actually, using the demographic information that we have or can get from some other source to try to attract a better customer. But I would tell you this. We're in the very beginning stages of even thinking about doing stuff like that. John Reyes : Ross, to give you some color, on television last year, we spent about $4.5 million, and on the Internet, we spent about $13 million. So the Internet is by far our major marketing channel. And that's a combination of some of the marketing stuff John has touched on, the website and then bidding on various terms and prices across the country. Ross Nussbaum : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yeah. Hi. Can you just talk a little bit about G&A costs for 2016, kind of what might be a good run rate, and how much of legal cost will be \u2013 are you guys assuming for 2016? John Reyes : I'm looking at our GC here, and she is smiling and shaking her head. She doesn't know what legal costs will be. But we're estimating a ballpark range of between, for G&A, for the entire fiscal 2016, somewhere in the neighborhood of between $80 million and $90 million. George Hoglund : Okay. Thanks. And then just one thing on Europe, I think you just commented a little bit on Shurgard's performance. And then also, how is development ramping up in Europe? Kind of last quarter, you guys had mentioned that they're starting to pick up. John Reyes : Sure. Well, let me start with development. Last year, we opened three properties in London, and we've got three more at various stages of development as well either we've taken down the land or about to take down the land. We're working through the zoning process. So, all \u2013 combine that, when that's done, we'll be at about 500,000 feet added, $90 million invested there. And we're looking at other market to look to do some development and it's Berlin, but we don't have anything in the [indiscernible] the moment. For Europe, Q4 revenues were up 4.7%. Income was up 1.3%. They had a fair number of R&M stuff and property tax credit last year that didn't fall through this year, so expenses were up a bit. So, it didn't \u2013 all the revenue growth didn't flow through to the bottom line. For the year, Europe revenues were up 4.5% and NOI was up 5.5%. So, Europe had a very good year. Occupancy average for the year 89.8% versus 85.3% last year, and minor degradation of rents. So, it was very good year in Europe operationally. George Hoglund : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Burke with Green Street Advisors. Ryan Burke : Thank you. Ron, a gap in operating ability has always existed between PSA and your private competitors. In your view, has this gap widened or narrowed over the last five years, and why? Ronald Havner : Well, since I have no information on private competitors, I can't answer that question. Ryan Burke : Okay. And if we can look to a point beyond 2016, just speaking specifically towards PSA, in an environment where operating fundamentals have slowed meaningfully, what are the main weapons that you'll utilize to continue to capture outsized share demand? Is there anything particular that you have left in the closet right now that hasn't been brought out yet? Ronald Havner : Well, the great thing about Public Storage is we have a thing called the brand, which no one else has. So, that is the, by far, the biggest, so to speak, bazooka which we're using all the time. We combine that with the operational skills of our field personnel who are exceptional, the Internet marketing, the technology, all that in a platform. If you look at how \u2013 what market share we have in the major metro markets, I mean, for the most part, we're the dominant provider. And as I think I've said before, when things get tough, the big dog eats first, and we're the big dog. Ryan Burke : Sure. Thanks. And you produced 22% NOI growth in your 2013 acquisition bucket during 2015. Can you provide just in general the early-stage strategy of acquisitions? What do you focus on from a revenue and expense standpoint during year one versus year two versus year three. Ronald Havner : Well, expenses, they fit in to the platform. So, if you have a property in Miami or Dallas or LA, they just kind of fold into the district, and the operating platform, and the expenses become very consistent very quickly with what other properties in that market are operating for \u2013 operating out in terms of an expense per foot other than property taxes which is always kind of the swing item on the expense side. On the revenue side, it's fill them up as fast as possible. Generally, discount rates increased promotional discounts, fill them up to get them stabilized and get that tenant base in there. And then, operate them consistent with the way we do the rest of the portfolio. Ryan Burke : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Hi. A couple of things. First, I was wondering, can you give us the January 31 spot rates that you typically do, the year-over-year rate increase for occupancy, et cetera? Ronald Havner : Sure, Mike. At the end of January, occupancies were 93.2% which is 93.0% and our in-place rents were 15.50% versus 14.61%. So, occupancy is up 0.2%, in-place rents up 6%. Michael Mueller : Got it. And then... Ronald Havner : Street rates were higher. Michael Mueller : Okay. And then, for rate increases going out to tenants at this point, any color you can share with us? John Reyes : Yeah. Mike, this is John. We really haven't started sending that increases or we'd be gearing up at the end of this month to really start sending the first wave out. I anticipate that'll be very similar to the past two years. People who been here longer than a year will receive an increase, and the increases that we've been doing in terms of percentage, year-over-year percentage increases have been in the neighborhood of 8% to 10%. So I expect that we'll continue that in 2016. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. Thanks. John Reyes : You're welcome. Ronald Havner : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Thanks. Just looking at the full-year acquisitions, it looks like occupancy were in the 85% range and rental rates were sub 13%. Can you give us a feel of what those numbers look like at the end of last year, and then I know you made some acquisitions so far this year, just what the fundamental trends are? Ronald Havner : I'm sorry, Todd, what number are you referring to? Todd Stender : What were the occupancies of the acquisitions you've made lately and then rentals rates? Just seeing how far they can be pushed once you hold on to them, that's where I'm going. Ronald Havner : Yeah. Well, most of the acquisitions were, David, 80%, 85%? Yeah. 80%, 85%, we didn't, I don't think we bought anything that's ground up empty. We got one in Houston that was zero, Todd, that's a fill up. But for the most part, they're somewhat stabilized properties, somewhere between 80%, 85%. Extrapolating what's that going to be versus what is in our press release, right, because the acquisitions \u2013 I'm looking here at the annual contract rate of 1506, that's probably not the way to go because the rate per foot is going to vary by market. So if you get a property in Ohio, it's going to have a very different rental rate than a property in New York. So you really can't take things and say, okay, everything's going to migrate to $1,506 a foot. Generally, though, once we get them stabilized and up into the platform, our ability to push rates consistent with everything else we've said on the call, 6% and then rental rate increases, pretty much happens. Todd Stender : That's helpful, Ron. And how long is that period for you to stabilize them according to your metrics once you layer in tenant insurance, and maybe if concessions start to slow down, what does that period look like? Ronald Havner : Well, operationally, in terms of fitting them into the system and operating them as a Public Storage property, I mean, that's usually 30 to 90 days. The real estate group is great at fixing the offices, rebranding the property. It goes into the system in terms of Internet, marketing on the website, in the call center on day one. So, you can usually see quickly the impact on moving volumes once it gets into our system. There's usually problems on delinquency, so we have outflow. But generally, six months to a year, you get the thing stabilized, and then in the second year is when you start to see some meaningful growth. Recall, if you're going to lower rates and increased promotional discounts to fill it up, revenues generally going to not \u2013 revenue growth is not going to be very strong in the first six months to a year. Todd Stender : Great. Thank you. Ronald Havner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Baird. RJ Milligan : Hey. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could give any color on the estimated development yields and redevelopment yields on the projects within your pipeline. Ronald Havner : Development yields after an imputed absorption cost are going to be somewhere between 8% and 10% on a cash-on-cash basis. With no absorption, it's going to be 150 basis points higher than that. Develop \u2013 we developed \u2013 so that's on the development. The redevelopments can go anywhere from 10% to 30%. Then, as I've said over and over again, redevelopments are great because it's low risk, you know the property, you're not paying for the land again, and I wish we could do $1 billion a year of those. But they're just not that much opportunity. RJ Milligan : And in terms of those development yields, is there a difference between markets? Are there any markets where the development yields are much more attractive and particularly the high barrier to entry markets or what traditionally has been those high barrier to entry markets? Are you seeing any difference in development yields regionally? Ronald Havner : Well, generally, the higher barrier to entry markets are where we're having greater competition for the land, and we're having to pay up for the cost, so those yields tend to run a little lower than the lower barrier to entry market. And the way we look at it is, okay, on a lower barrier to entry market, we need a higher yield because it probably won't grow as much as these high barrier to entry market. RJ Milligan : That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Ronald Havner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yeah, guys. Just looking at the balance sheet. You guys have about $375 million of the Series Q preferred, they're callable in April, and almost $500 million of the Series R, they're callable in July. I was wondering what the plans are there. John Reyes : George, this is John. We don't have any definite plans at the moment, but I would say that it's pretty likely that we make call one or both of those series, but we haven't made the final decision yet on that, but I wouldn't put a passage from calling them. George Hoglund : Okay. And would it be \u2013 would you be more inclined to just refi it with more [indiscernible] or do you include some unsecured debt? John Reyes : We could be both. We did a preferred in January, so we're sitting on cash which will cause a little dilution to our assets in Q1, and that was a $300 million deal. I don't know whether the preferred market will be open throughout the remainder of 2016. We did mention that we were looking at doing unsecured debt that's still \u2013 that is not off the table, it's still on the table. So, we could do that also. So, we'll wait and make a decision when we need to. George Hoglund : Okay. Thanks. John Reyes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Hey. It's Jordan Sadler here. Just a quick question regarding sort of appetite on the acquisition front. I know you've got some competition out there from some of the smaller competitors. But just curious, there were some that seemed like they'll be a little bit more on your wheelhouse geographically in L.A. that crossed recently, curious if those were on your radar, if you had interest and just maybe talk a little bit about your appetite. Ronald Havner : Jordan, good to hear from you. We have an appetite for acquisitions. We tried to be disciplined in our approach in the stuff. In California, we looked at it. It's a pretty good product we just couldn't get our heads around. I think that went from about close to 300 a foot, and we just couldn't there in terms of that kind of pricing. But it's good product, it's fine. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then on a separate but similar note, when you guys make acquisitions, I know you give some pretty good disclosure on this but just in terms of breaking your acquisitions from prior years out separately rather than include them in your same-store portfolio. But what do you view as sort of the potential uplift? In terms of buying something from a private operator, you buy something that's maybe not fully stabilized, but what maybe a private guy would call somewhat stabilized. What are you able to sort of pick up in incremental yield on those acquisitions over sort of a one- to two-year timeframe? Ronald Havner : Well, Jordan, that depends on a lot of variable factors. Generally, we try to underwrite where we think there's \u2013 I'd say, on average, 150 basis points, 200 basis points uptick in terms of NOI over 12 months to 18 months. One of the things that we overcome in acquisitions is property tax reassessment. So whereas an operator may have had the property for 20 years, he's got a low tax basis, we buy it. Now, we've got to pay tax bill, so you kind of make that up in your NOI in you growth rate. But generally, 150 basis points to 200 basis points. The stuff we bought in 2013 and prior and even 2014 is performing better than we anticipated because the industry fundamentals are better than anticipated. We underwrite things on today's rent in that marketplace. We don't do a forward forecast of what we think rents might be two or three years out. And so the fact that the operating fundamentals in the marketplace across most of the U.S. have been very good in the last 24 months, has helped us outperform our own expectations in terms of our last couple of years acquisition, as well as our developments. Our developments are performing across the board better than we anticipated. Jordan Sadler : That's helpful. Thank you. And then Todd has one on on-demand. I know you know that business a little bit. Todd Thomas : Yeah. Hi. Just quickly on a number of those on-demand storage services that are operating in a few of the major metros. Are you seeing any impact from them in some of your markets, any competition or anything that you can comment on? Ronald Havner : Well, at record occupancies, I would say no. The Bay Area where a lot of that tech stuff, we know of a couple of things up there that are going on, no impact. We are chock-full in the Bay Area. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Ronald Havner : Thanks, guys. John Reyes : Thanks, Jordan. Thanks, Todd. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Good morning, everyone. Can you provide an update on the development in Glendale? How is that leasing so far? Ronald Havner : 85% or 90%, it's full. Wes Golladay : Okay. What type of yield did you get on that? I guess it looks it's vastly exceeding underwriting. Ronald Havner : It will. It has not been open a year. So, taking the last 10 months of income is not indicative of what that income is going to be over the next 12 months. But I think we end the road with three-year fill-up pretty good, probably even a little bit longer than that. And so it's far exceeded our expectations. And the other about that fill-up on the property is we do not have to discount rates. It's heavily \u2013 to get it filled up as we normally do on a typical development. So, it's a homerun. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then when you look at acquisitions, how far are you on the final price where [indiscernible]? And with the cost of preferred coming down and cost of equity coming down, will more deals make sense now versus, say, last year? Ronald Havner : I'm sorry. I didn't understand the first part of your question, Wes. Wes Golladay : Okay. Yeah. So how far off are you when you look at acquisitions that you're missing on pricing? Are you like 5% away from the final price, or is it like 10% to 15%? Just wondering if the improved cost of equity, cost of preferred equity will help you pencil more deals in this year. Ronald Havner : Yeah. Well, there\u2019s two things. It's both yield and then price per foot because we have a development platform. We know about what these things cost to build. And so even though the yield may kind of fit the current cost of capital, you could get \u2013 in terms of cost of capital, you could get really creative and say, well, our line cost, less than 1%, so why don't we use that in terms of underwriting acquisitions, which we don't. But when we're looking at LA properties at 300-foot and we're building in LA at a 150-160 a foot, we're just not going to pay 300 a foot. Wes Golladay : Okay. Got you. Thank you. Operator : There appear to be no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clemente Teng : I want to everybody for participating on our call this morning, and we will talk to you next quarter. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem and welcome everyone. We had another solid quarter here in Q1. So, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gwen Clark with Evercore ISI. Gwen Clark : Hi, guys, good afternoon. So I realize this information will be available on the 10-Q, but since that data won't be out for a few, can you give us some color on the operating performance within your largest metros? John Reyes : Glenn, this is John. I can run through some of those. So Los Angeles, which was by far our largest market, revenues were up about 8.2%, San Francisco which was on second -- I'll just give you a top ten. San Francisco was 7.8%, New York 4.6%, Chicago 2.4%, Seattle 8.4%, Washington DC 2.6%, Miami 6%, Dallas was 8.9%, Houston 5.2% and Atlanta 7.8%. Gwen Clark : Thank you and I guess on that note, seems like Chicago and DC were at the definite under performers, can you just talk about what do you think was driving that? John Reyes : Well DC has been an underperformer for us for several years actually, we struggled with DC, and I think that\u2019s mostly competition. With respect to Chicago that's more of a recent phenomenon. Don\u2019t really know exactly what's going on in Chicago, it's been a struggle for us throughout the market, so it's not just any particular part of the market. So I really can't tell, I think we're keeping our occupancy there but we're lacking pricing power. We'll just keep working on that and see if we can improve it soon. Gwen Clark : Okay. Clem Teng : Gwen, when you get through the queue, I think you will see that actually Chicago's NOI was up almost 11% and that's not due to operating fundamental, that's due to less nodes than last year. Gwen Clark : Okay, that is helpful and with that I'll hop back in. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Thanks. I wanted ask you about your acquisition activity which looks like it's picked up year-to-date and I think is now an access of what you did for the entire year in '15, and I was just curious, ar you seeing more products come to market or are you changing, what you're looking for in some of the acquisitions you're making or is there any -- something that\u2019s driving that increased volume there? Ron Havner : Smedes, this is Ron. We've not changed our criteria at all, but I would summarize the market for acquisition as more product, lower quality, higher prices. Smedes Rose : More products, higher prices and lower quality Ron Havner : Yes. Smedes Rose : Okay, but so within all of that, you're still able to find something that you like. Ron Havner : It's a broad market as a whole, inside of that are some good products, some reasonably priced. We were able to do some transactions here and there, but historically we intend to do what make sense for us as a franchise, what makes sense for the platform, what make sense on a price per foot, it varies by market and that strategy has not changed, it's consistent, we continue to build out the platform in the markets where we are. Both submarkets as well as markets in general. So nothing has change in terms of strategy, but we are seeing given the robust pricing, more product coming to market and I would say overall lower quality. David Doll is here, so David would you have anything to add to that? David Doll : No, I think the only reason we're seeing a little more activity is we've got, looking for some of those one off and off marketed properties that can fill in some of our -- as Ron suggested markets where we're trying to build out scale. Smedes Rose : That's helpful, thanks. Ron, when you say higher prices, can you maybe just generally just quantify like how much CapEx have declined in the last year or quarter, how are we going to measure it? Just to get a sense of pace of price increases of what folks are asking? Ron Havner : My guess would be, everyone measures cap rates different Smedes, they include insurance or retail or don\u2019t include certain operating expenses, so it's a little hard to say in terms of the way we underwrite and what we're seeing out there. I'd say 50 to 75 basis points at least. David? David Doll : 1.5 times to 2 times replacement cost. Smedes Rose : Great, okay, thank you very much. That's helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jana Galan : Thank you. I was wondering, if you could talk about the decisions to grow the development pipeline and maybe comment on land prices and construction costs? Ron Havner : Well, the decision to grow the development pipeline, our growth -- to development started about three -- in earnest about three years ago, and we started doing that in part because we couldn't find product and markets or submarkets where we wanted to build out our franchise, build out a platform and two, we saw the continued escalation of prices of acquisitions which previous question I just answered, just kind of comes up bare it has been for the last 12 to 18 months. So, the pricing on acquisitions wasn\u2019t making sense and then getting new product in markets where we didn't have existing product is rational for the development platform. And to the teams' credit this quarter we ended with 600 million in the pipeline which is a new record for us and most of that about two thirds of that 350 million will be delivered this year, which is also fantastic. In terms of construction cost let me pass to David. David Doll : So construction costs, across the country there's different markets where we're seeing acceleration of costs mostly due to labor shortage or subcontractor coverage. Markets like the Bay Area, Miami and smaller markets like Phoenix and Denver we're starting to see some pressure on construction costs. Land prices generally I'd say factor of availability and so in those key markets where availability is becoming more and more difficult, then we begin to focus our efforts on redevelopment and most of those markets we've got a great portfolio that can be redeveloped on our existing real estate. So the team has to be nimble in terms of where those opportunities exist and how they could execute it. Jana Galan : Thank you and I believe last quarter you identified overall supply maybe about 1,200 plus storage facilities in some stage of development, just curious if you had an update on that number? Ron Havner : I think that's been pretty close between 800 and 1,000 and that's nothing has really changed, my guess always it's accelerating, so as we go through the year that probably -- number will accelerate, the number of people entertaining development, trying to get their arms around it, or undertaking it continues to grow. Jana Galan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Jeremy Metz : Jeremy Metz on with Ross. John, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are seeing on the rent front, given the maturity of the portfolio close to max occupancy, it does seem like you guys are still able to get some good traction pushing rents in the market continues to bear it, so any color on street rates where they trended during the quarter and maybe that spread between move in and move outs? Ron Havner : I'd say that the street rates during the quarter were up about 5%, the take rate on our move in, which are move in were about up 1% during the quarter and they were moving in that rate that were about 4% higher than last year. The move out rates that were up 5.6% year-over-year and just to give you a flavor of the take rate, the move in rate was about average on the per unit basis about $124 versus the move out rate of about $135, which is about probably $11 difference there. And that compares to last year at about $119 move in versus $128 move out. Jeremy Metz : That's pretty similar, and then just one on the -- you had a pretty good bump on the late charges in admin fee this quarter, I was just wondering is that more late fee driven and assuming you'd be even be willing to provide it, are you able to say what kind of percentage of the portfolio is in [indiscernible] at this point has that increased at all lately? David Doll : With respect to delinquencies, we're close to or at record low delinquencies. So the uptick -- it's late fees and admin fees, the late fees haven't changed, it's all in admin fees, we've bumped those a little bit last year. And so on a year-over-year basis they're higher, plus as John noted you got about 1% - 1.5% increase in move ins. Jeremy Metz : Okay, and I think Ross has one quick one. Ross Nussbaum : Your occupancy in March was flat year-over-year, do you have an update on where you are here at the end of April? David Doll : I have an update, yes as of yesterday we were up about 11 basis points. Ross Nussbaum : And then Ron, given your comments on where the transaction market is with lower quality and higher pricing. Have you thought about putting some of your \"lower\" quality noncore smaller market assets up for sale and using that as a source of development funding? Ron Havner : Well we have thought about that Ross, we continue to think about that. In terms of needing that as capital for development, we have plenty of firepower here on the balance sheet to undertake our development program. Keep in mind $300 million to $400 million, call $350 million a year of retained cash flow goes a long ways towards funding the development program. That's what our spin will be this year, so it's basically -- this level of development we're basically taking our retained cash flow and underwriting the development program. To your first question yes we are -- we continue to look at maybe peeling off some markets where we don't want to grow in and we don't have much of a presence. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Todd Thomas : Ron, just following up on new supply curious to get your read over whether there are any markets where you think that there are some real overbuilding taking place that you're watching carefully or were you maybe a little cautious over the next year or so? Ron Havner : Two markets that come to mind Todd, one is the boroughs in New York, we have -- we don't have anything in the boroughs per say, well we've got one on Long Island and we've got one over in Jersey City but that's it. But just looking at the sea of ordeals of the other public, our public competitors as well as what we know is going on, the borough seem to have materially above average level of development and high proportion of existing supply coming in, the other is Denver where we've been told there's 40 to 50 properties on the board or about to be developed in that market, which is a big number for that size of market. We're developing quite a bit in Dallas, we -- where we are developing North Dallas, we're not seeing a lot of new competitors, we're down in Houston, we've seen some uptick in Houston, but nothing relative to the size, in terms of size and market, nothing from our perspective to be concerned about at this juncture. Todd Thomas : And then the lease up cycles for new development say -- they were taking place at a much-much faster pace for quite some time. Has that changed at all or with some of the new deliveries or -- is absorption taking place at pretty much the same pace? Ron Havner : We're pretty much ahead across the board in terms of our selling up faster, ahead of pro forma, so that process continues. The fundamentals of the business are great. Our customer acquisition costs were down again this quarter, we've brought in more customers at lower costs than higher rates. So, the fundamentals of the business continue to be just excellent. And that's playing into fortunately our development platform as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Just wondering if you could talk about overall operating expenses, in 1Q you guys benefitted from lower snow removable cost, but as far as trends going into the rest of the year, are there are any areas where we could see savings that would keep the cost lower? I mean I would assume you guys won't be expecting a negative, another negative quarter year-over-year costs, where could we see some savings then? Ron Havner : George, I don't recall what Q2 snow removable cost were last year, I'm sure we had some, it was a pretty tough winter last year, so there maybe some minor positive expense variance on snow or next year but most of the other expenses, as I always say, I would count on 2% to 3% property taxes we've got them running at 4.5%. We don't see that change much, so if I were modeling I'd model 2% to 3%. Operator : Our next question is comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, good morning guys. So, just a follow up on a previous question, you guys gave April occupancy stance, so I was wondering if you could provide contract rate, what that looks likes in April or moving rates which I really think is more useful. Ron Havner : Ki, we don't usually provide that but I don't think there was any trend different in April than what John mentioned in the first quarter in terms of moving rates and move out rates, and street rates versus take rates. Ki Bin Kim : So, I guess just broader, is this spring leasing season, generally behaving the same way the previous couple of years spring leasing seasons have behaved in terms of you guys being able to push that take in rate or contract rate year-over-year, much higher in the spring time versus winter time? John Reyes : Ki, this is John, yes, it is, you seen that sequential push, I think that difficulty for us in Q2 is comps compared to last year where we had an exceptional Q2 last year, that was surprising to us about how much demand came in and our ability to continue to push rates, so we're confident against that but the trend lines are still the same but it is a tougher comp for Q2 this year than we experienced historically. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : I was wondering, any color on Europe, can you just give us quick rundown of what you're seeing over there? John Reyes : Sure, Mike. Europe occupancies for the quarter were 89.8% versus 88.1% so up 1.9%. Realized rents were up 3.1%, so overall rev path growth was 5.2% for the quarter. Expenses were only up 2.8%, so we had 6.7% NOI growth across Europe, so the team is doing a great job over there, every market was up in terms of NOI being led by Sweden at 16.2%. The laggard was Germany at 0.8% Michael Mueller : Got it and just in terms of investment activity over there, what's going on in terms of development or anything on the acquisition side? John Reyes : We opened up three new properties in London in the back half of last year, we've got a couple of more that we're undertaking this year. We're trying to get things started in Berlin. So that's on the development side, nothing at this juncture in terms of acquisitions. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Belcher with Wells Fargo. Jason Belcher : If you could give us some of the operating metrics for the assets that you acquired in the quarter, as well as those already acquired so far in Q2, I'd be particularly interested in any color you could share on the occupancy rates in place versus market ramps and cap rates. Ron Havner : Jason, I don't have the occupancies or any of that stuff on the acquisition here with me. They are generally somewhere between 70% and 85% occupied. In terms of price per foot, we acquired was about $110 and $120 a foot, it varies by market. Jason Belcher : Okay, thanks and then just on the preferred you issued in January, I think it was 5.4% coupon, wondering where you think you might issue that now? John Reyes : Lower. Jason Belcher : Alright, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Hey guys, looking at Europe, how are the barriers to entry in that market from a development side, is it difficult to permit finance relative to say a core West Coast market such as San Francisco and Los Angeles? Ron Havner : London and Paris, first of all those are the big market, I assume we're talking about the major metro centers, London, Paris, Berlin? Wes Golladay : Yes. Ron Havner : They're just like Los Angeles or San Francisco or Manhattan, I mean, you've got core -- the core markets the inner ring in Paris, downtown near Buckingham Palace is central part of London. First of all you can't get zoning, second of all if piece of land is for sale it's incredible expensive, probably doesn't make sense, so it's equally as tough. And that the sites we've done in London are -- they've not been easy in terms of getting the zoning. Same challenges that you face here where the markets where you really-really want to be in and there's no competition, it's really hard or there's no zoning. Wes Golladay : And then when you go to market such as Europe is your platform -- we always talk about the -- your platform in the U.S. has been much better than some of the small mom and pops, do you have that same advantage when over to Europe and can you consolidate anything over there? Ron Havner : You got to keep in mind, in all of Western Europe and again this is best guess statistics, somewhere between 1,500 and 1,800 facilities in all of Western Europe including Great Britain, over half of which are in Great Britain, so the product that's available across the continent is pretty thin, there's not a lot of -- I think in Berlin there's 10 to 12 facilities in all of Berlin. So, there's not a lot to buy and the product is on an average I'd say much lower quality than U.S. because a lot of that was not purpose built, a lot of it was converted, office, converted garages, converted industrial buildings, and it takes a variety of shapes and sizes. So, not a lot of purpose built product in Europe, not a lot of product to even buy and most surprised there's over in Great Britain and a lot of its outside London. Operator : And there appear to be no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clem Teng : Thank you for participating on our call and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Have a good afternoon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ron. Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem. Welcome everyone. We had another solid quarter here in Q2. So, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Sun Trust. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Hey Ron, could you comment a little bit about the same-store revenue deceleration? I know, it\u2019s not that much; it\u2019s only 50 basis points also good number, but I am curious if you can provide some details of what caused it. And tied to that, I cover you, I have always known you guys to be little bit more biased towards occupancy part of equation, so maybe a comment on the decline you saw towards the quarter-end? Ron Havner : That\u2019s a lot of questions, Ki, but I\u2019ll try to answer it. And then, I\u2019ll have John chime in with some details. If you look at the same store portfolio and growth year-over-year between -- in our top 20 markets, you see two markets that really stand out, Denver and Houston. Denver\u2019s revenue growth year-over-year declined by 8.3% and Houston year-over-year by 6.6%. So, those markets declined from nearly double-digit growth last year to about 2% this year, and then you\u2019ve got Washington DC chugging along down there at about 2% growth as well. But the big declines were in Houston and Denver. And those are also markets where occupancy degradation was probably 150-200 basis points. So, challenging markets, we have fair amount -- there is a fair amount of new supply in the markets, we have a number of properties and to fill up. So, there is some cannibalization of the product there. But I think Houston itself has some general economic slowdown there. The other markets, our West Coast markets are doing phenomenal from San Francisco to LA to Seattle, Sacramento and they\u2019re full. So, they are not able to grow enough in terms of occupancy to offset the decline in markets like Denver and Houston. So that\u2019s kind of the big picture in terms of revenue growth. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Does that mean -- I can see those two markets being the supply -- controlled by supply markets\u2026 Ron Havner : Supply, in Houston, you\u2019ve also got, I think there is some impact there from the slowdown in the oil industry, probably some outmigration of people in that marketplace right now. Ki Bin Kim : So, would I be stretching too far, if I assumed for the other markets where as you talked about more supply coming on, not just this year but maybe next year as well, is this -- kind of draw straight line and say there is other markets that might be seeing this weakness further down the road that might impact your overall results? Ron Havner : Well, certainly, there is new supply. And I\u2019ve been saying for a year or two years that new supply will definitely impact revenue growth. And certainly, in markets I think like Denver, New York, it is impacting to some degree our revenue growth. But if you look across the markets, you got Denver down 8%, Houston down 6%, Chicago and West Palm Beach were down 2% but everything else is plus or minus 1%, kind of the standout on the upside were Seattle 2% change in the growth rate year-over-year and Sacramento up 3% year-over-year. Sacramento had a phenomenal quarter up 11.8% in terms of total revenue growth. So, everything else is kind of bouncing around plus 1, minus 1. But then, you\u2019ve got these big anchors there in terms of Chicago, Houston and Denver. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, I am here with Jeff Spector. Just a question on rates. Any sense of what you\u2019re being able to push on a portfolio basis to start the third quarter? And if you can help us maybe get a picture of how that trended throughout the second quarter each month, maybe throughout the second quarter versus July and maybe what we are seeing in August to-date? John Reyes : Juan, this is John. Our rates, I would say, as we continue to the second quarter and into July, we have continued to -- overall, portfolio continued to ratchet rates downward, so that now our rates are below last year. We have also turned on more discounting, the dollar special discounting as well as discounting our websites. And as Ron mentioned, much of that is coming from some of these weaker markets. So, overall that\u2019s down. But there is markets that are up, like the West Coast that Ron mentioned. So, I would expect, until we see this weakness -- and if the weakness is coming in on the demand side, our existing tenant base is not turning over any faster than it has previously; the move-ins that do come in are sticking around just as long as they have always had, I think the difficulty that we are seeing in these markets is just lack demand into our system and therefore, we are having to reduce pricing and increase promotions. Juan Sanabria : And could you give us a sense of what the year-over-year delta is in maybe July, just to see how that\u2026 John Reyes : I don\u2019t have that, but I could tell you in the quarter, the year-over-year delta in the move-in rate, last year the delta -- I\u2019d say the year-over-year move-in rate delta is about -- we were up 3.9% on the move-in rate, but our move-in volume was down about 3%. So, overall, in terms of I would say contract or projected ramp, we were up slightly by about 0.5 percentage point. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then just on the supply picture, could you give us a sense of what you are forecasting or thinking supply could be across your markets\u2026 Ron Havner : Do you mind getting back in the queue, so that people can ask? Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Ron, do you want to touch on supply? Ron Havner : Sure. I think it continues to expand. I don\u2019t have the second quarter numbers from all the public companies yet. But last year, at the Self Storage Association, I gave kind of a projection of 30 million square feet to be delivered this year. And using the same methodology, it\u2019s up to about 38 million square feet. So, whether my methodology is correct or not, if you extrapolate that, there has been about a 20% uptick in the volume of new supply in the last 12 months. Again, it varies. As I have continued to say, it varies by market. Certainly the lower barrier entry markets such as Dallas, Houston, parts of Florida, people think of New York as a low barrier to entry market, but there is a lot of supply coming in New York. Those are markets that are gaining, I would say, above average growth. And supply, while markets like San Francisco, Seattle and even most of LA have an absence of new supply. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. And I guess second, it was striking this quarter that your expenses were up little over 4%, I realize the first half of the year you\u2019re still low at 0.6%. I know sort of talked about expenses, maybe finally picking up to a more normal rate, maybe people have doubted that, but maybe it started to come. I guess, can you just talk a little bit about some of the line items that are up? In particular, the onsite payroll was up 6.5%. And I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re saying on a sustained basis kind of vague inflation and other things that maybe putting you in a more normalized expense environment. Ron Havner : You said it correctly at the front, Steve, I\u2019ve continued to say expect expenses 3% to 4%. And so, we\u2019re, kind finally there. First quarter, Q1, we got a big benefit of snow removal, and obviously that\u2019s not going to recur. Property taxes continue to drive our expense growth there, by far the largest item, and they are up to a 5% run rate. Onsite payroll, wage growth is about 1% and 1.5%, the change in payroll is really -- we had a workers\u2019 comp credit last year I think of 1 million, 1.5 million, and then we had an uptick in medical insurance. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that line. Going forward though, obviously over the next couple of years, here on the West Coast, we\u2019re going to see an uptick in base wages due to changes in minimum wage laws. Does that address kind of what you\u2019re thinking about? Steve Sakwa : Yes. I guess it sounds like maybe this sort of call it 3 plus percent expense growth, which you\u2019ve been able to keep in kind of a 1% range, plus or minus maybe ending, and we should be thinking about a more normalized expense environment, sort of from here forward. Ron Havner : I think that\u2019s a fair statement. John Reyes : Steve, this is John. I\u2019d also add that advertising expense is going to uptick. And what we will be doing in some of these weaker performing markets is we will be increasing our advertising spend on the web, as well as we may increase our spend on television advertising sometime in the third quarter and into fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : So, staying on the development topic, I mean your development pipeline is now about 630 million. Do you see that number is continuing to grow, and are you seeing any cannibalization from your new developments on your existing portfolio? Ron Havner : Well, last year, I said the development pipeline was hitting about 500 million, I thought that was a peak; and Dave Doll and the team down there have moved it up to 600 million, certainly some of those properties will fall out. But, I\u2019m pleased with what we do have in the pipeline. We\u2019re going to have about 180 million of the deliver in the back -- in the second half of this year. So, it will come down, we\u2019ll see if the team can replace that 180 million. We continue to develop, we see attractive yields; in some markets, just there is some cannibalizations. Although we trying, very focused in terms of developing where we don\u2019t have existing product right near our current products. That\u2019s not always the case, there is some cannibalization. And certainly smaller markets like Austin, Texas where we put a lot of product over the previous two years and we\u2019ve seen a lot of other new product, there has been kind of greater than average cannibalization, say in a market like Dallas where we are building, mainly in North Dallas where we don\u2019t have much product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : So, just looking forward into the back half and 1Q where things are naturally a little slower and maybe rate -- you pulled back on rate a bit. How are you strategically and tactically thinking, given what you\u2019ve expensed this past quarter? Obviously, the results are pretty strong, but I am just looking forward and saying at that time when things are weaker, what do you expect in terms of reiterating [ph] your ability to push overall rate? John Reyes : We\u2019re still pushing rates, the renewal rates to existing tenants; we are still marching down the same path we have. We are obviously watching that to see if it\u2019s triggering any ramp up and move-out activity. So far, it hasn\u2019t. As I mentioned, the real struggle on some of these markets is on the front end and getting more demand into our system. But if it continues -- the weakness will continue -- we will just continue to cut rates and we will continue to discount until we finally couldn\u2019t get to a point where we are comfortable that we\u2019ve found an equilibrium that we are happy with. So, we are not afraid to cut rates. And we will go right after market share. Vikram Malhotra : And so, just to ,clarify the existing -- can you just give us an update like how much is existing rate -- the rate to existing customers, is that in line with recent trends and street rate is still in that 6% range? John Reyes : Yes, we are still sitting on increases to the existing tenant rates, just like we did very consistent with what we have done over the one or two years, and the range is somewhere between 8% and 10% increases. Again, we are not seeing that our existing tenant is any less stickier than they have been in past. In fact, I think Ron\u2019s is getting through at it with the deck here, and I\u2019ll let him do that out. But, the problem again in those weak markets that just trying to get the move-in volume coming in the door. Ron Havner : The percentage of customers greater than a year for the second quarter was up to a 56.5%, which is an improvement from last year\u2019s 55.9%; and two years ago, it was down at 54%. So, we have moved that 2.5% over the last couple of years. Operator : And the next question comes from the line Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : First, a follow-up. John, I just was wondering if you could provide a little clarification. I think I heard you say that rates were lower year-over-year in July. Was that asking rates that you are referencing? John Reyes : Yes. Todd Thomas : Can you just provide a little more detail there or quantify what the year-over-year delta looks like? John Reyes : The year-over-year delta, I think the move-in -- I am going to refer it to what they\u2019re move-in and out versus the street rates because street rates, they are not as important as the actual move-in rate that\u2019s coming in, in the door. Move-in rates were down about 2.5% month-to-date compared to the same timeframe in July of last year. I\u2019d say, again, just keep in mind that\u2019s the average for entire system. Seattle\u2019s probably up 6% to 8% and Houston\u2019s probably down 5%. So, this is -- I am just going on averages here. Todd Thomas : And over the last few years, is this the first time system-wide that you\u2019ve had a reduction in asking rents year-over-year during a month? John Reyes : I don\u2019t have that data in front of me, but I think so. But, I don\u2019t know. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then, I am just curious, you just -- Ron, you just mentioned that you\u2019re increasing rents to existing customers, the percentage of customers who\u2019s higher year-over-year in the quarter. If you do start -- if you continue to reduce asking rents system-wide, what does that do to the percent of the portfolio that gets a rent increase or is eligible for a rent increase? Ron Havner : Generally, as you reduce rates, customer duration gets longer. And, so that by definition then or axiomatically would say, okay if customer duration increases, percentage of customers greater than year increases, therefore the more customers eligible for annual rate increase. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to happen, but I mean that\u2019s -- in theory, that\u2019s what would happened. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Gwen Clark with Evercore ISI. Gwen Clark : Just really quickly, can you give us an update on how Shurgard did during the quarter? Ron Havner : Sure. For the quarter -- this is same store, Shurgard had 7% NOI growth, occupancy was up to 90.6 -- average 90.6 versus 90.1 last year, and realized rents were up 3%. Overall, revenue was up 3.5%, expenses were down 1.3%, that\u2019s how you got to the 7% NOI growth. Do you want by country? Gwen Clark : No, I think that\u2019s good, but by and large it looks like those metrics look good. And, how you are guys thinking about your strategy post Brexit, if that hasn\u2019t impact at all? Ron Havner : It has no impact, I mean we\u2019ll deal with whatever kind of unfolds in Brexit. Keep in mind in Europe, over the next 12 to 18 months, you have a substantial number of elections, which could change the political environment quite dramatically over in Europe combined with the Brexit. So, we will see how it plays out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Jeremy Metz : Ron, I just wanted to ask you one on succession planning, and if you could talk about the decision to Joe Russell over to Public Storage and PSB? Ron Havner : Well, the decision was, we had a great candidate, a person Maria Hawthorne, who was capable of ascending to the CEO position at PS Business Parks, a 31 year employee, and which then made Joe available. Joe has a phenomenal track record at PSB. We have not had a COO at Public Storage for about a year and a half. And so, he is a great addition to the management team. Jeremy Metz : So, no intension to step down in the not too distant future then I\u2019m hearing. Ron Havner : I\u2019ll be here next quarter. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And then, in terms of Oklahoma, your acquisition there this quarter more than doubled your footprint in that market. I am guessing maybe this was a portfolio deal. So, I guess my question is, if you did this to protect your current position in the market or is this a market on your radar to further go into? Ron Havner : We haven\u2019t closed anything in Oklahoma. Jeremy Metz : Okay. I guess you have them under contract, right? Ron Havner : Yes. If it\u2019s under contract and not closed, I\u2019m not going to comment on that. So, if we get it closed, that\u2019s a good question for next quarter. Operator : Our next question come from line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to back to -- you mentioned that move-in volumes are down, and I\u2019m just kind trying to think about -- and as much as you can tell, do you think that\u2019s a factor of new supply overall or do you think there is sort of an affordability issue where the industry has push rates, high and long against very high occupancies for so long or people are just sort of turning away, and you need to make it more affordable again, which is kind of -- it sounds like what you\u2019re doing? Ron Havner : I\u2019ll will start and let John finish. Go back to my earlier comments of a number markets whether it\u2019s Sacramento, Seattle, even LA, Dallas, San Francisco, we during the second quarter here, we were full last year at 96%, 97%; we were full again this year at 96%, 97%. So, in terms of net pick up in move-in volumes, there was no more space to sell this year than it was last year. Where the markets are soft whether it\u2019s Houston, Chicago, Denver, as John touched on, we\u2019re cutting rates and it seems to be a demand issue. And so, that\u2019s where you probably had the greater fall off in move-in volume. So, think of it as part of your portfolio, a good part of your portfolio is just sold out year-over-year, and so you\u2019re not going to have much of change in move-in volume. And the stuff that is soft, is where you\u2019re going to have degradation in move-in volumes precipitating the change in rates that John touched about. Michael Bilerman : Hey, Ron, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Just going back to Joe Russell, can you talk a little bit about the role and responsibility? And I think when it was announced, it was President, didn\u2019t have the COO in the press release. So, talk a little bit about, sort role, responsibilities that you want him to accomplish. And then, talk about how it may be different? You have had a number of people through that role over the last five to ten years and not much stuck. And so, I\u2019m curious, how you expect Joe to make an impact and what his tasks are going to be successful in that seat? Ron Havner : Well, Michael, those are all good questions but we\u2019re little early in Joe\u2019s tenure up here at Public Storage to really answer all of that. As you know Joe and REIT community knows Joe, he\u2019s an established leader and accomplished CEO. So, he brings much more to the table than the COOs that I have had. And two, I\u2019ve worked with Joe for 13 years, at PS Business Parks. So, I have a pretty good understanding of his capabilities. Right now, he is focused on learning our business and learning our markets. So, right now, he has no direct operational responsibilities, he is out learning the business and learning the markets. Michael Bilerman : And he probably had -- he had a pretty big move to make to come over, probably didn\u2019t need any storage? Ron Havner : That\u2019s good, Michael. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Michael Mueller : When you look at your developments that are in process right now, are you noticing any changes in the time to fill up, I guess going to that incoming demand question, is it impacting the development pipeline as well, the lease up? Ron Havner : No, Mike. So far, knock on wood, the developments are filling up ahead of plan. Now, keep in mind, we\u2019ve had somewhat of a strategy of being a little aggressive on pricing and promotion in some of them to accelerate that. So, the real test would be in a year or two, do we achieve the targeted revenue level, as rates are stabilized. But for the most part there on average, ahead of plan, ahead of plan in terms of NOI, well ahead in terms of occupancy, and we are very happy with the developments, deliveries and what\u2019s been happening. Our San Fernando Road property here in Glendale that we opened in the May last year is already 92%, 93% and is already at stabilized revenue level, so an absolute homerun. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : You traditionally haven\u2019t been a big seller of assets, but I know you had a few markets you were testing the prospects of selling, one is in the Midwest. Can you provide any updates there and your asset sales, and maybe any other markets you are looking to test? Ron Havner : Yes. We pulled that package and have changed strategy in terms of what we are going to do in those markets. I can\u2019t comment on that now because we are in the middle of trying to do a couple of things, but I would just we\u2019ve pulled that transaction. We don\u2019t have any properties on the market for sale right now. And maybe, next quarter or quarter after, I\u2019ll be able to kind of explain what happened. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Burke with Green Street Advisors. Ryan Burke : Thank you. Ron, as we talk about the potential for moderating topline growth, is changing consumer behavior or the impact of new supply worry you more over the next 12 to 24 months? Ron Havner : I am not sure I understand that question, change in consumer behavior? Ryan Burke : Yes. So, demand from either, or decision patterns of either your in place customer or new customers, what rent increases they are able to digest, where are you going to be able to push rents? Ron Havner : I think we\u2019ve touched kind of the differences in some of the markets where the demand issue is more of a problem, and maybe there is an uptick in supply there certainly in markets like Austin. So, that\u2019s having an impact on demand and rental rates. As I touched on earlier, we have not seen any degradation in the churn rate, and actually I have seen an improvement in length of stay this year versus last year, which would lead you to believe that customer stickiness and our ability to have pricing power with our existing tenant base is still quite good. Does that answer your question? Ryan Burke : I think that gets me far enough. In terms of the same store pool, you only rolled about 15 of the 120 assets that you acquired in 2013 into the pool this year, which makes the definition of your same store pool diverge from that of your peers even more so than it usually does. Occupancy on those assets is mid-90%, so I believe you could have rolled the rest of those in. Can you just talk to us about why you did not? John Reyes : Ryan, this is John. The reason why we didn\u2019t is because stabilization isn\u2019t just about occupancy. I could fill up a property in a year by giving it away for free, right, and throw it into the same store the next year, and revenues would then just go skyrocketing. So, we view stabilization not only as stabilized occupancy but also the stabilization of the rental rates that the existing customers are paying. So, for those properties that we acquired in 2013 that we did not put in the same stores, even though the occupancies were mid-90s, the rental rates that were being charged to existing tenant base were still far below what we think stabilized numbers should be. So, those properties, we didn\u2019t put in; they are still growing at a much more rapid year-over-year change than the same store properties that are operating in those same markets. So, clearly they are not stabilized. And so, we didn\u2019t put them in. Ron Havner : Ryan, to add some color to that, what John just said on the 2013 acquisitions, our occupancies year-over-year were flat 94.6, but the contract rents were up 7.4%. And NOI growth on those was for the quarter about 12%. So, as John said, it will look -- make the numbers look nicer or stronger if we put them in from a objective reality and in terms of are they really stabilized or not; they are not, so we have kept them out. Operator : Our final question comes from line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Market. Todd Thomas : Ron, realizing that the development machine takes some time to get ramped up here, as you look at growth perhaps moderating a bit at this point in the cycle, do you feel as you look ahead over the next couple of years that you need to make any changes to how you are allocating capital, as it pertains to development? Ron Havner : Todd, I am not quite sure I understand, are you implying or indicating that we should allocate more or less, I am not quite following your question. I am sorry. Todd Thomas : I know, in certain markets like Houston for example, you have talked about a commitment to that market long term, plans to develop, say 100 facilities or so. You are also seeing softness in that market today. Does that change at all your commitment to that market or how you think about the pace of development? Ron Havner : Couple of things, Houston is a great market, we think it\u2019s long term -- I mean, I view it as the oil capital of the world. It\u2019s a great dynamic market. There is a lot of sub markets within Houston where we have little to no product, and some markets where we do have some product, but we could penetrate those markets more, same applies to Dallas. And in those numbers, markets around the country, but those two markets in particular are very vibrant, and this does not change our program going forward. Now, what may impact our program is as rates roll down, it may adjust our ability to develop, because it may not make sense in terms of what we can get land for and construction cost and the returns that we want on development to build as much in Houston as I would otherwise liked. But long term, we are committed to those markets. Our development pipeline itself, I think we delivered through June about 320 million or so. And so, there is a fair amount of embedded growth on that. We\u2019re targeting stabilized deals, 8% to 10% on the developments. And I think in the second quarter, we generated about $2 million on that $320 million of investment. So, you can -- going forward, as you kind of go out, \u201817, \u201818, \u201819, those development deals will provide a substantial source of growth for us. Right now, they are bit of a headwind. Our 2016 deliveries for the first six months locked about a $0.5 million. So, net-net, we think it\u2019s a great investment long term. As I touched on, they are filling up ahead of plan. But it\u2019s a bit of a headwind on earnings today but a great source of future growth. Does that address your question? Todd Thomas : Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We do have a question from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Just a follow-up, on the non-same store pool, I guess if I look at the numbers, John, the occupancy is about 500 or so basis points below your same store pool and the -- I guess the realized rent per foot is about $1.50 lower. I guess one, would you expect this pool to ultimately catch up to the same store pool? And if so, do you think that\u2019s a 12-month process or more like the 24 to 36-month process? John Reyes : From here on -- well, first off, Steve, it\u2019s a different market mix than the same store pool; so, it\u2019s hard to compare the two, sort of apples and oranges. But, if I would say that in terms of potential future growth in this, I think that will probably another 12 months to 18 months away for another kind of rate increase to existing tenants before we start getting to that level of them reaching that stabilization point. Steve Sakwa : Okay. So, I guess you wouldn\u2019t expect the operating metrics of this pool of property, assuming it stayed static to maybe get to the same level of occupancy, as the same store or you would? John Reyes : All else being equal, if they\u2019re in the same market, they should get there. But my point is that there in different market, the different market mix, and I\u2019m not sure what they are. For example, if they are in Houston, could they get to the same market mix against same rates or same stores, probably not because Los Angeles and San Francisco dominate our same store pool. And they have much higher occupancies right now than Houston does. Ron Havner : And higher rental rates? John Reyes : Correct. So, you\u2019re here asking me to compare apples and oranges. All I\u2019m telling you is that they\u2019re not stabilized and I expect that their growth will continue to outpace the existing same store growth, not only the growth of the overall same store portfolio but those properties that are in the same markets, they will continue to outpace them, just because of still filling up or stabilizing on rental rates. Operator : That was our final question. And I like to turn the floor back over to Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clem Teng : Thank you for participating on our call this afternoon. And we will talk to you next quarter. Have a good afternoon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Clem Teng. Please go ahead, sir. Clem Teng : Good morning, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Here with me today are Ron Havner, and John Reyes.

You could find our press release SEC reports and audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Ron. Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem. Welcome, everyone. We had another solid quarter and so with that I'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Good afternoon. And definitely want to recognize great growth in the quarter. Just Ron if you could give us maybe two minutes overview on the state of the market. You guys did a great job telegraphing some of the issues we may see this year in storage but if you could just summarize I guess the latest that you're seeing, whether it's supply, concessions, and how you're thinking of running the business through the end of the year that would be appreciated. Ron Havner : Sure, Jeff. I think big picture, a couple of items. Our revenue growth rate obviously slowed down to 5.1% but it's an incredible number, 5%. It's down from 6% last year but still a great number. If you look across our Top 20 Markets, all had positive growth year-over-year except one, Houston. The interesting thing though or trend thing that I think you want to get after is that if you take 80% of our revenue base, the rate of change in our growth rate decelerated in the third quarter year-over-year so you take a market like Houston which their year-over-year growth rate was down 9.3% Q3 '15 to Q3 2016. Denver was down 8.8% Q3 '15 growth rate versus Q3 2016. So 80% of our revenue base had a decline in the rate of growth and certainly, we were up against very tough comps from 2015. We had had an incredible third quarter last year. But what does that tell me? That growth is slowing. It's not all due to new supply because not all of these markets are impacted by new supply to the same degree. But you have markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco which are certainly supply constrained, very hard to get new product in. I'd say relatively new low new supply but their rate of growth slowed. The other big picture is expenses, uptick this quarter and for us, there's a couple of explanations, but overall expenses were up in the big change, one of the key items I think you should focus on is property taxes up 5.4% which continues to ratchet up year-over-year. Supply is up and the rate of change in new supply continues to accelerate. It's different across various markets and I think that will continue to be a head wind on pricing power going into 2017. For us, we're going to continue to build our development pipelines up to 600 million. David and the team have done an excellent job and product that we're building is just exceptional. It's filling up pretty much according to plan and our acquisitions we\u2019re also doing quite well. For the most part the stuff we bought from 2013 through 2016 most of it is ahead of what we under wrote. So the fundamentals of the business are still great. It's just the rate of changing growth especially the top line has slowed a little bit. John do you want to add any color on pricing and what we're doing in terms of marketing? John Reyes : Yes, I would say that what we are experiencing is mostly a softness in demand. The existing tenant base that we have is pretty much staying put like they normally have so they aren't vacating anymore rapidly than we've seen so the struggle I would say that we are experiencing is really on the front end, getting move-ins. Demand appears to be soft around the country not in any one particular market. I'd say in general every market is experiencing softness and as a result we're advertising more television, we're advertising more on the internet. We are lowering our street rates and we are giving away a little bit more discounts not much more than last year but a little bit more of this year so but again I'd like to emphasize that the existing tenant base is not vacating out any more rapidly than they have. We're continuing to send rate increase letters similar to how we did last year with increases in the range of 8% to 10%. Jeff Spector : Can I ask one follow-up on that softness in demand, can you discuss that a bit and is there anything you attribute to that specifically related to the economy whether it's jobs or lack of income growth? John Reyes : Well Jeff, I'll touch on that. It kind of goes to and this is my point in terms of 80% of our revenue base had a slower year-over-year rate of growth than Q3 of last year. We're up against very tough comps. It's broad based and a number of these markets have very dynamic economies, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Seattle this quarter had had had a positive year-over-year rate of growth change. Sacramento, Minneapolis, so there's a lot of markets that still have some growth in them but it's broad based in terms of slowdown and I think in part it's due to just an exceptional 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : Following up on the slowdown in demand and revenues, I was wondering how that impacted the acquisition market and how you're underwriting assets today versus a couple of quarters ago? Ron Havner : It's not materially impacting what we're doing. In underwriting our acquisitions, we use what we have in terms of kind of a spot price, in terms of rental rates on a trailing basis. We don't necessarily try to anticipate what the forward rate per foot is going to be, and then of course for us, replacement cost has been and continues to be a key element in terms of our underwriting. So the market may be tough. Take Houston. If we can get something at 60% or 70% replacement cost, we'll do that deal even though in the short-term we may be impacted by overall market conditions. Gaurav Mehta : And as a follow-up, have you seen any changes in cap rate for stabilized assets in any of the markets? Ron Havner : Not really. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Could you give some stats on the move-in rate for the quarter and how that trended into October, please? John Reyes : This is John. The average move-in rate during the third quarter was about $135 per month. That compared to last year at $137 for the month. That was for the quarter, on a monthly basis. Month to date in October, the average move-in rate is about $127 per month, and that's actually up a little bit from last year which was about $126 per month. But I will tell you this, notwithstanding the fact that it is higher than last year, the volume of move-ins that we are getting in the month of -- at least month to date October, is down about 3%. So we're getting higher rates but lower volume. Ki Bin Kim : And I guess as a similar question I asked, like half an hour ago, with your competitors call, but I know we tend to focus a lot of the supply side, but overall on the demand side, what do you think is causing it? The lower traffic or lower volume or price sensitivity? Because we just haven't seen it before in this sector recently, so what do you think is really causing this change? Ron Havner : It's so broad based. And it varies by market, while John is saying volume is down 3%, in a number of markets right now and submarkets we're chalk full. We have not much space to sell, so there's not much of a volume uptick that we can get. And then you have markets like Houston which have probably both a supply issue as well as an overall local economy issue with the big changes in the oil industry. And the other markets, whether it's San Francisco or LA, don't have enough net new space to sell to offset the decline in volume in markets like Houston or Denver. Ki Bin Kim : And how about New York? Ron Havner : New York is doing okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Gwen Clark of Evercore ISI. Gwen Clark : So I know the information will be given in the Q, but since that won't be out for awhile, can you just give us a brief run through of the market performance? Specifically? Ron Havner : In terms of NOI? Gwen Clark : Revenue and NOI would be great if possible. John Reyes : Why don't I give you kind of some of our top markets. So Los Angeles was up 7.1% for the quarter, and this is in order of our largest to smallest within our top, let's just say 10. So Los Angeles was up 7.1%, San Francisco 6.2%, New York 2.9%, Seattle 9.1%, Washington D.C. 2.7%, Miami 5.5%, Chicago 1.6%, Dallas and the Fort Worth area 6.4%, Atlanta 7.6%, Houston was down 1%, Philadelphia was up 5.3% and Denver was up about a percentage point.  That might be 10. And then in terms of NOI growth, Los Angeles was up 7.8%, San Francisco 6.2%, New York 2.1%, Seattle 9.7%, Washington D.C. 1.3%, Miami 8.7%, Chicago was down a negative 3.4%, Dallas Fort Worth was up 5.8%, Atlanta 7%, Houston down 5.4%, Philadelphia up 6.2% and Denver was down 1.2%. Ron Havner : I'd add, Gwen, that Chicago and Houston, in particular, while the revenue was modest or negative, they were also really impacted by property tax increases year-over-year. Gwen Clark : Okay. That's helpful. And of these that sticks out, Houston, Chicago, Denver, D.C. are clear underperformers of the group. Can you talk about what you think is driving the demand within these markets, just from a very high level perspective? And what might be affecting the growth rate? Ron Havner : Well, as I touched on in Houston, you've got -- there's not a huge amount, but new supply in Houston, both from us and competitors. As well as kind of a macroeconomic condition with the oil industry and a dramatic slowdown in job growth and probably outmigration of people. Denver, the economy is good there, but there's a big uptick in new supply. And D.C. was that your other one? Washington D.C.?  That's been a languishing market for awhile. It's been languishing for apartments, it's languishing for office and its been a tough market for us. A couple years ago the government shutdown, a lot of reduction in spending, and that created some outmigration of people and that really has not returned. I think the market stabilized there, but it certainly hasn't been on an upswing. Operator : Your next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc. Todd Thomas : Ron, the discounting, the promotional activity, the move-in rates you touched on earlier, can you just talk about how all of that boils down to the net acquisition cost per customer that you've talked about in the past? So what that cost per customer was in the quarter and how that compares year-over-year? Ron Havner : Sure, Todd. Marketing costs in Q3 were up 9.5% and that's -- or about $670,000, and that was evenly split between incremental TV and incremental internet advertising. Promotional discounts were flat, so our overall customer acquisition costs were up 2.2% for the quarter, move-ins were up 1.1% or about 2,800 incremental new customers Q3 this year versus last year. So that gives you an acquisition cost of $127 versus $126 last year. Move-in rates for the quarter were down 1.5%. Fees were up 9.1%, so our net profit per customer move-in was $32 this quarter versus $33 last year.  Year-to-date, Todd, net profit per customer move-in was $38 versus $33 last year, so we had a 15.2% improvement in profitability. Year-to-date move-ins are about flat -- or I'm sorry, costs are about flat. Move-ins were down 3,200, but rates were up and fees were up, so net-net, we made 15% more per customer this year than last year. Todd Thomas : And then on EXR's call last hour, management noted that they suspect that there might be some impact in the New York market from some of the full service operators. Are you seeing there in terms of either slightly lower move-in activity or increased customer acquisition costs as a result of some of the increase in competition around that market? Ron Havner : No, our New York markets have pretty well stabilized and are trending slightly up. There are easier comps, but, no, I think John gave you the revenue growth for New York, up 2.9%, which wasn't bad for Q3. So we haven't seen anything. John Reyes : Todd, they may be affecting us and I'm sure they are, but to the extent that they are, we kind of don't see it in our numbers. I mean, they could be taking away, let's just say 10 customers a facility, it's hard for us to notice that. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask, Ron, you mentioned a couple of things going on the expense line and you kind of called out the property taxes. As we look at the quarterly expenses up to 6.4%, is there anything in any of those line items that were maybe one-time in nature for this quarter, or do you feel like we're just going to be on a higher run rate than you have been over the last couple of years? Ron Havner : Yes, Smedes, a couple items. You see onsite payroll there up 6.7%. Most of that is due to about $1.5 million increase in our medical insurance cost to employee benefits, and that's been up year-over-year, but we had $1.5 million increase in Q3. We'll probably have another $500,000 or so increase in Q4, smaller amount but still a meaningful percentage increase year-over-year. Advertising I touched on. Up about $600,000 split between TV and internet. And then the other big swing item was allocated overhead, which was up about $2 million. About $1.6 million of that was costs attributable to our annual sales conference, which we held in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year. So just over $1 million of that will flip back around in Q4, as we expensed it in Q4 last year, and Q3 this year. Smedes Rose : And then I just wanted to ask you, too, at least relative to our forecasts, the equity and earnings on consolidated entities was up significantly, it was up year-over-year a lot. I assume that's Shurgard, and maybe you can just give a little color on how that performed in the quarter? Ron Havner : Yes. Well, I think it's both Shurgard and PS Business Parks. And Business Parks, I think -- I don't think, I know -- their earnings were up about 20% quarter to quarter. That's a combination of two things. Solid same-store results, build up of some developments, and then they -- Business Parks has been sitting on $150 million or $200 million of cash, and so at the end of June they paid off a $250 million mortgage, and so they had nominal interest expense Q3 versus having cash and the interest expense last year.  So half the improvement in Business Parks was due to reduced interest and half of it was due to improved operations. Shurgard Europe had good operating results both from the same-store and non-same-store properties, but a big chunk of their difference was a $1.5 million special tax provision we made in Q3 last year that we did not make in this quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Can you maybe just elaborate on some of the expense items, in particular advertising, as you see potential occupancy or growth moderate a bit, given how much more -- how many more customers are coming via the internet? Can you give us how you view the marketing and advertising bucket over the next, call it year or so? John Reyes : Yes, this is John. Over the past year or two we've enjoyed a reduction in advertising as demand was coming in without the need to really spend more. In fact, we cut back significantly on both television and on the internet. As we go forward, if the softness continues and we expect that it will at least over the next quarter or two, perhaps beyond, I don't know, I anticipate that we will spend more on -- definitely more on the internet, on keyword search terms, probably spend more there than we will on television advertising. We did do a little television in Q3 and into Q4. I wasn't really thrilled with the response that we were getting, but we have been getting some pretty good response on the web.  More and more of our customers, as you know, are moving to the web, whether they are using their desktop or mobile device, we're there, we're in both channels. So I expect, at least in the near term, our web spend will continue to tick up. I don't think that our television will really tick up. It will probably be the same. But, overall, marketing costs will definitely be up. Vikram Malhotra : And just to clarify, the allocated overhead, I believe there was a shift from 4Q to 3Q. Can you just elaborate on what that was? Ron Havner : You mean what I just touched on in terms of the annual sales conference? Vikram Malhotra : Yes. That's what drove all of it? Ron Havner : Yes. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. George Hoglund : Just looking at the balance sheet, early next year you've got $460 million of 5.9% Series S preferreds coming, that are callable, and another $460 million of the 5.75% Series T preferreds. So what are your plans for potentially calling and refinancing those?  And then just generally speaking, what sort of spread from existing preferreds to where you could raise preferreds at, which you view as necessary to call and do a new issue? John Reyes : We haven't made any decisions on what we're going to do with that Series S and Series T that you mentioned are callable in early -- or in the first quarter of 2017. I think it will depend on what the capital markets look like as we start getting close to that. You're probably aware we just recently issued a preferred at 4.90%. That was about 10 days ago. I don't think that we can issue another one today at 4.90% under today's conditions, but that may change.  What does the spread need to be? It probably needs to be at least 75 bps before I think we would really want to issue another preferred to take out some of these other preferreds. But I also wouldn't rule out us issuing debt. We've talked about debt before, so that's always a possibility that we could issue debt and take out some of these preferreds, but I want to make sure that you understood, we haven't made a decision on what we're going to do in the first quarter yet with respect to these preferreds. Operator : Your next question comes from David Corak of FBR Capital Markets. David Corak : In terms of individual market supply, going beyond the usual suspects, you mentioned a couple of these earlier, but we've heard some anecdotes recently about building picking up in certain west coast markets, specifically San Francisco. Can you touch on what you're seeing out there if anything? Ron Havner : Dave Doll is here with us, so I'll have him respond to that, what he's seeing? David Doll : I would say core San Francisco, no, I don't see a lot of pick up in core San Francisco. There may be some outliers like Sacramento and some other submarkets to San Francisco. Portland seems to have a fair bit of new supply coming into that market. San Diego has a fair bit being built for the size of the marketplace, but again, we don't see that much in Los Angeles or Orange County. We aren't really focused on Riverside and San Bernardino where there may be some more building going on. David Corak : Maybe just a bigger picture question for you Ron. We're now pretty well into a development cycle nationally, if you want to call it that, but in terms of your overall strategy for revenue management, what are guys planning on doing differently, if anything, this time around from the last time we were entering a development cycle? Just in terms of what you're doing with rate, occupancy and strategy overall? Ron Havner : Well, David, I like to say the big dog eats first. And so I think going into this cycle, we have better pricing, better pricing strategies, better marketing, both television and internet. Our market position, in terms of our market share, product, where it's located is better headed into this cycle. We've really got great positioning and we will have next year as the deliveries come on in terms of Dallas, Houston, Miami, Charlotte, LA, San Francisco, so I'm really happy -- Seattle -- with our market position. Our people are fantastic out in the field. We've got better product that we have available to rent. And I think our processes are as good as they've ever been. And I'm just skipping over the balance sheet, which has never been stronger in our history, so we're really ready for this cycle. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I guess, still good morning out there. Ron, I know you've been asked a lot about the revenue side. I guess what I'm trying to really get a handle on is if you looked at the third quarter fundamentals and maybe broke it down by month, and looked July, August, September and maybe even October, would you say the rate of decline picked up throughout those four month periods? Or it was higher in the beginning and slowed as we got towards the end? Ron Havner : On expenses, Steve? Steve Sakwa : No, sorry, on revenue growth. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, is the slowdown getting worse or is the slowdown moderating and getting less bad as we move forward? John Reyes : Steve, let me see if I can answer the question a little bit. If you take the time and go back and look at our first quarter press release where we describe our same-stores, we give some metrics at the end of the quarter what our square foot occupancy is and what the annual contract rate per occupied square foot is. If you look at the first quarter, we reported that it was a 5.9% delta year-over-year.  That is a good indicator of what second quarter might be and second quarter turned out to be a 6.1% revenue growth. If you now go to the second quarter information that we reported, we reported that the square foot occupancy had a negative decline of about 0.5%, that the annual contract rate was up 5.4%, the net of those two is a 4.9%, and we in fact reported a 5.2% for the quarter. So there was a big drop from Q1 to the end of Q2.  We went from 5.9% to 4.9%. If you now look -- fast forward to the end of the third quarter, those same numbers are now at 4.7% versus 4.9% at the end of the second quarter, so the big drop, as you kind of touched on, happened in Q2, we're still experiencing a decline, but the big drop happened earlier this year. Steve Sakwa : Right, so you would say the rate of slowdown is kind of moderating and while it may get a little bit worse, we shouldn't be having a cascading down effect on the revenue as we look going into 2017? John Reyes : Well, I'm not commenting on 2017. I'm just telling you what's happened year-to-date, and what we're seeing month to date in October Ron Havner : Steve, if you go back to 2015, the revenue growth in Q2 last year was 6.8%, year-over-year, Q3 was 6.7%, Q4 was 6.6% and then Q1 this year was 6.5%, and then it started moderating, so that rate of change, right? We had exceptional quarters in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of last year. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : I don't think we've had any comments on acquisitions this call, so I was wondering can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing, you're seeing more product in the market, any changes in pricing, just some bigger picture comment there? Ron Havner : Well, I'll let David talk about volume, but in terms of pricing, I think we touched on earlier, no material change in pricing. David Doll : Volumes I think are down -- or at least I should say, the quality of the product coming to the marketplace is less than what it had been in prior quarters over the last year or so, so I think buyers are being a little more selective. There's lots more that we pass on than what we're buying. Primarily due to quality of the product. Pricing hasn't changed that much. Will it continue to change? I don't know. But I think there's been a slowdown of quality product coming to the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Burke of Green Street Advisors. Ryan Burke : John, I don't believe you provided this, but what was the roll down from move-out to move-in rent for the quarter? And also for October? John Reyes : Okay. I put that away. I didn't think anyone was going to ask that question. So for the quarter, as you mentioned about the move-in rates, it was about $135 per move in, the monthly rate. The move-out over the same time frame was $144, so down about $9. Last year it was $137 on the move-in and the move-outs were going out at $140. So about $3. Ryan Burke : And then just one more question. There's all this talk about demand softening in terms of coming into your system, but how do you measure and quantify that? Is it simply internet traffic plus walk-ins? And are you able to quantify the deceleration that you've seen in the third quarter in October? John Reyes : The way I look at it, Ryan, is I look at it as the call volume into our call center, the hits to our website, where they are actually seeking and looking at storage space. So it's not the hits that come to our website of exiting tenants who are paying their rent, as well as looking at our walk in traffic, as you mentioned. During the third quarter we were actually seeing an uptick in sales calls. Part of that is due to increased marketing activities. The web channel was about flat though. But the channel that, I think, gives me most concern is that our walk-in traffic was down about 7%. So two of our channels were either flat or up, but the walk-in channel was down. And I can't tell you why that has happened, but in fact, it was down 7% during the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Occhionero of Barclays Capital. Dan Occhionero : Could you give us the geographic dispersion of your development activity and what markets are you building the most product in? Ron Havner : Sure. If you take our pipeline, $680 million or so, and that's both redevelopments as well as ground up developments, 49 properties, 5.3 million square feet. So do you want number of properties, square footage, value? Dan Occhionero : Square footage would be good. Ron Havner : Okay, so 1.9 million in Texas, 900,000 in California, 150,000 in Arizona, 550,000 in Florida, 430,000 in Washington, 150,000 in Tennessee, 270,000 in North Carolina and 240,000 in New Jersey, and then some smattering of others. Operator : Your final question comes from Jeremy Metz of UBS. Jeremy Metz : Just one quick one. I want to stick on the development front. I was just wondering if some of the correction in the market, be it lower rates, increasing discounting, if that's created any additional opportunities on the development front for you guys, either opportunities to go acquire some land to build or markets where maybe you were holding off, but now it seems like a better time to start construction? Ron Havner : Well, I'll have David amplify that, but Jeremy, generally, if rates are trending down, all other things being equal, that's going to slow development for us because the deals won't underwrite the way -- in terms of what we're trying to achieve in terms of return on invested capital, so a declining rate environment won't do that in the near term. Also in the near term, land prices tend to lag changes in market conditions. Just like on the way up, they tend to lag on moving up. When you see the market turn you can usually get good land deals for a period of time, so they tend to lag on the way down. So far, at least I haven't seen any big reductions inland prices. David? David Doll : I think you're correct. The sellers and developers are usually the trailing indicators, not the leading indicators, so it will be some time before those deals come to fruition. Operator : We do have time for one more question. That question comes from Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : It's actually Michael Bilerman. Ron, I'm curious, you've always focused on cash flow and cash flow growth rather than any sort of NAV metric, but I'm curious now that the stock is around $200, which is probably just about where you probably peg your NAV, but more importantly from a cash flow perspective, a free cash flow yield north of 5%, does that entice you at all to put your -- what you described as the best balance sheet you've ever had, into your stock at this point? Ron Havner : Well, Michael, I'll just say this. If you looked back in time over 20-plus years, it's very rare that we can issue preferred at coupons below the earnings yield on our stock. And we're getting pretty close to that. The last time that there was, that it happened to any -- for any extended period of time was 1999/2000 when everyone wanted dotcom stocks and real estate was a bad word. Brick and mortar. I don't know if we're going into that now, but it's very unusual for us to be able to issue preferred coupons lower than our earnings yield. So we're getting close, and as John touched on, we'll see what we can continue to issue preferreds and or debt at, but it's not out of the question as time goes forward in terms of where to deploy capital.  Having said that, if we can deploy capital in third party acquisitions or development opportunities that provide a better spread yield or better overall earnings yield to the Company, then we will do that vis-a-vis our share repurchases. So which part of the menu, acquisitions, development, or share repurchases makes the most sense in terms of capital deployment, in terms of both growth and then creation of shareholder value. Michael Bilerman : Well, I guess would you want to have a program in place so that you can be able to execute if choppiness continue in the stock market? One would hope that it doesn't, but if it does, then you want to be prepared to be able to execute? Ron Havner : We have a share buyback authorization. Michael Bilerman : And how big is that? Ron Havner : I don't remember the exact number, but it's big. Michael Bilerman : Perfect. And then last one just on Europe, is there any plans at all to float or change the ownership structure there in terms of proceeds that we should be thinking about? Ron Havner : Not at this time. Europe is generating more cash flow than it can deploy, and so while they are ramping up their development program over there, their free cash flows is $80 million to $90 million a year, which is more than they currently have plans to deploy. So in terms of an IPO, it would be tough to do in terms of use of proceeds. That could change in three to six months if some big opportunity came up in Europe, but at this time, I don't see that. Operator : We do have another question from Ryan Burke of Green Street Advisors. Ryan Burke : Thanks for letting me slip one last one in. The question is, during past periods when we've had move-in rate growth go flat to negative, what exactly has happened to existing rate growth for that subsequent near term period? Is there a change in your willingness to push that first rent increase around the six-month mark, and what happens to the magnitude of the rent increases? John Reyes : Ryan, this is John. We'll continue to test it and push it and see what happens. We constantly will have a test group kept out of the normal group that's getting the increase to see what the reaction differential is to the rate increases, and if we do see some upticks, then we'll adjust accordingly. I can't respond to how we've done it in the past because, one, I don't remember, and two, I don't think we were smart enough to really test it as well under such circumstances. But we will do that this time around and then we'll adjust, as I mentioned, as we see fit. Operator : This concludes today's question and answer session. I'll now turn the floor back over to Mr. Clem Teng for any additional or closing remarks. Clem Teng : Okay. I want to thank you all for attending our call today. We'll see many of you at NAREIT in a few more weeks, so have a good afternoon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Clem Teng. Please go ahead sir.

You can find our press release, SEC report and an audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ron. Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem. We had another solid quarter. So operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, good morning everyone. So if I think about your company is actually you guys have always had a slight preference for keeping occupancy high, with that said ended the quarter we saw 50 bps decline in occupancy, while you guys maintained Street rates 4.7%. So my question is any type of change in the strategy and are you willing to let occupancy slight little bit more for fake of Street rates. And I guess is there a inherent pressure for you to keep Street rates high in order to sustain the profitability of existing customer rate increase program. John Reyes : Hi, Ki Bin, this is John. All great questions. No, we did not change our strategy to let occupancy falls. So that wasn\u2019t \u2013 something that was intended. We certainly would like to see Street rates maintain themselves and move higher because that\u2019s important when it comes time to raising our rates to existing tenants or giving renewals. But that certainly was not the intent of what you saw there in the fourth quarter. So nothing\u2019s change, the occupancies, obviously ebb and flow and what you saw in the fourth quarter was I think a little more move out activity than we had expected, but nothing more than that. Ron Havner : Ki, I would add that our strategy is not principally focused on maintaining high occupancies. Our strategy is growing revenue per available foot. So that\u2019s managing volume, rate, promotional discounts, all three together to optimize the revenue per available foot that we have to lease. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And Ron, if I think about some of the comments you\u2019ve made in the past about the supply picture in industry. I would say your estimates have a little bit higher and medium or correct on the overall supply coming in, with that said and things \u2013 and looking at the results in the fourth quarter and third quarter. Do you think it is possible, when summertime comes around this year that Street rates or net effect of rents can rebound? Or do you think that\u2019s probably difficult given what\u2019s happening with supply and demand out there. Ron Havner : Ki, it\u2019s \u2013 really it\u2019s predicated on the market. If you look at the information released now that all the public self-storage guys have reported. If you take their CFO pipelines and we\u2019re planning on delivering in 2017. Our best guess is about \u2013 for that group about 5.1 million, 5.2 million square feet. So that\u2019s up about 25% from the 2016 deliveries. Now the current pipeline for 2018 is down, but I don\u2019t believe that the 2018 pipeline is completed yet. I think people still will be working on the 2018 pipeline, in the first half of 2017. So we\u2019re going to see \u2013 that looks like about a 25% increase in deliveries just from the public competitors and my guess is that whether the industry is 25 or 20 or 18, there\u2019s a meaningful uptick in new deliveries 2017 versus 2016. But that \u2013 those deliveries are not uniformly spread across the country. And I would have to say at least in terms of dollar value it appears most is coming into the New York market, just in terms of absolute dollar amounts in terms of new deliveries. We don\u2019t have anything coming into the New York market. We just opened Jersey City, but we don\u2019t have anything coming into the market going forward. But CUBE and Extra Space appear to have a fair amount coming into that market. So obviously that market\u2019s going to be faced with a lot of supply here in the next couple of years. The other market that kind of pops out is Portland, Oregon. We\u2019ve seen that and we\u2019ve seen a meaningful uptick in new supply there in Portland. We\u2019ve already seen it in Austin, Denver. So it\u2019s not uniform across the country. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : Great, thanks. Can you comment on what you saw on promotional and discounts in the quarter. John Reyes : Yes, I \u2013 probably this is John. So, our discounts were up, in terms of dollar amounts were up about 1.5%, we give away about $19.9 million of discounts versus $19.6 million for the same quarter last year and this is for same-stores. Approximately 77% of our move-ins had some sort of discount and that compares to about 72% for the same quarter last year. Gaurav Mehta : Okay, great. And as a follow up, can you comment on how your assets under lease up doing especially in Texas. Ron Havner : Yes, for the most part they\u2019re leasing up, but I would say it\u2019s too early to tell because normally in lease up we\u2019re little more aggressive on rental rates and promotional discounts and so while they occupancy may be higher. It will be a year or two in terms of really understanding. Are we achieving the rental rates that we underwrote? But so far they seem to be doing pretty good. Gaurav Mehta : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Hi there. I wanted to ask you on your pipeline, I think you said in your release of about $430 million under development now being delivered. And what are your thoughts of continuing to develop at this juncture. And maybe also your sort of view on acquisitions given slightly higher cost of capital, but also you seeing any changes in cap rates on potential acquisitions. Ron Havner : So your question is, are we going to continue \u2013 is your first question, are we going to continue\u2026 Smedes Rose : Well, yes, really \u2013 yes, on your development, you\u2019re sort of appetite to continued to develop at the same pace that you have been. Is that, I mean, would you expect to continue to do that over the next year? Ron Havner : It really depends on the economics made, if you\u2019re talking about a market like Houston, where construction costs have not come down, land prices have not come down, but rental rates are coming down. I would say future development in the near-term in terms of building our pipeline is probably limited. Same probably goes for Denver, we start building in Austin about 12 to 18 months ago for those very same reasons. But that doesn\u2019t mean other markets such as Seattle, Miami, LA, don\u2019t have deals to pencil and so we will continue to build as long as the economics over there. And then we have a wide variety of redevelopment opportunities at any one juncture. We\u2019ve got 16 redevelopment opportunities in the pipeline and I would expect to see that grow into 2017. Smedes Rose : Great. Okay, thank you. And then just on the acquisitions outlook, do you \u2013 have you seen any changes I mean giving slowing fundamentals it looks like across the industry, we\u2019re seeing that show up and pricing or not really. Ron Havner : Well, the pipeline first quarter is pretty thin, but that\u2019s consistent with prior years. So my guess is pricing will adjust, but just if nothing else due to changes and expectations of growth rates going forward. But we haven\u2019t seen a lot of transactions clear here in the first quarter or even a lot of product on the market. Smedes Rose : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks good morning out there. You mentioned that the move out activity was a little bit higher in the quarter than you expected and that drove the year-over-year decrease and occupancy at end of the year. Do you anticipate being able to close the occupancy gap on a year-over-year basis or would you expect it to be lower throughout the year in 2017. John Reyes : I mean Todd, we could easily close the occupancy gap, if we cut our rates and put it on TV and promoted more, so as Ron said it\u2019s not just about the occupancy. So I\u2019ve not focused on that gap or say, again we\u2019re trying to drive our revenues higher create more cash flow per square foot is what we\u2019re really trying to do. Todd Thomas : Okay. John Reyes : I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s going to unfold in terms of what demand characteristics are going to look like or moved out characteristics for that matter. Todd Thomas : Okay, and can you talk about where occupancy was maybe on a year-over-year basis, what that spread look like at the end of January or maybe today. Just to get a sense for how business is trending so far on the occupancy side. John Reyes : I would say it was very similar to how we ended the year. I think we ended the year, but we have about 50 basis points lower. Todd Thomas : Okay. All right, thank you. John Reyes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Jeremy Metz : Hey guys, I am on with Nick as well -- has a question here. First I want to follow up on questions from earlier. I was wondering if you could talk about your medium length of stay versus your average length their stay, which I believe is around 35, 36 months. And what exactly that means or revenue growth going forward from here in terms of the impacts from existing customer rate increases versus the need for overall market rent growth to drive revenue growth from here with occupancy basically full at this point? Ron Havner : That\u2019s an interesting question. It\u2019s very important. We\u2019ve talked about the aging of our portfolio those tenants that have been here longer than a year. And the reason why that\u2019s so important is because those are the folks we generally give rate increases to. And in the past have about our increases \u2013 the rate increase has generally been I think for the past two to three years somewhere in the neighborhood of 8% to 10%. So to the extent that that tenant base that have been here longer than a year deteriorates, that gives us less opportunity to send those increases out. I could tell you in the \u2013 for the full year, our overall increases to tenants resulted in roughly about $16.7 million to our contract rent. And that compared about $14.5 million last year. So that was about a 14% increase, which \u2013 when you look \u2013 when you think about the ins and the outs that move in and the mood outside, that pretty much is a wash to a negative. So we kind of rent rolled down on the move in and move out activity. So the bulk of the growth that we have experienced over the past couple of years, it\u2019s really come from the rental rate of renewals or the increases as we call them internally. Is that answering your question, Jeremy? Jeremy Metz : Yes I appreciate it. And it sounds like you are also saying you\u2019re still getting kind of those high single-digit existing rate increases. And assuming that is right, maybe could you just let us know where \u2013 how Street rates trended in January versus last year as well, just to frame this all of out? John Reyes : Well, Street rates were about flat to up maybe 1% or 2%. We haven\u2019t started sending out increases during for 2017 will begin that in a couple of months. But so far the tenant base that has been with the longer than a year hasn\u2019t deteriorated. So it\u2019s pretty much impact, which is a good thing. So the degradation in our occupancy as we discussed earlier is really more from some of the tenants that have been with us \u2013 or were only with us over the past six months. Jeremy Metz : Okay, I think Nick had one, quick one. Nick Yulico : Yes, hi, it\u2019s Nick Yulico. Ron, I want to ask you about the Trump in-house proposals to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%. I\u2019m wondering, how you and the board are thinking about the benefits are staying REIT, if the corporate tax rate is lower versus instead becoming a C corp or you would have more flexibility and how much capital you can retain or even your ability to say fund a large buyback of stock. Ron Havner : Well, certainly there\u2019s \u2013 if you take the extreme at the corporate tax rates of zero, you would say why you would be a REIT. And so has the corporate tax rate goes up, the incentive to become REIT gets greater. I think it\u2019s a little premature to kind of comment on what we would do or not do since what the tax plan is, what\u2019s going to happen to interest expense, what\u2019s going to happen to deductibility of capital improvements will have a big impact in terms of what is the final taxable income. If we bought $700 million of \u2013 and developments and acquisitions last year and we got to detect that in the first year that we certainly change our perspective in terms of what our dividend policy is. So there\u2019s a variety of moving parts that that would impact that final analysis in terms of what we would do. Nick Yulico : Fair enough, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BoA Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. I was just hoping you could speak to how you think about street rates as we go into 2017 and your ability, or the ability for the market to see that improve into the peak leasing season given the 25% year-over-year increase in supply? And how you think it may play out I know it\u2019s early and the Street rate growth this year, versus, let\u2019s say, last year? Ron Havner : I will let John elaborate, but certainly a 25% increase in supply is a headwind to pricing power and certainly in the markets that I mentioned earlier where those deliveries are coming. I believe that will be a big headwind in terms of pricing power and may even and most likely, like in New York where you\u2019ve got 20%,25% increase in supply over the next two years, probably rent roll down. John Reyes : Yes, I would agree with Ron. It depends on the market, I mean, Houston, P&R rates are probably down about 10% year-over-year whereas in Sacramento, California they\u2019re probably up 10%. So it really depends on the market where the supply is coming from and how it\u2019s affecting demand into our system. So we\u2019ll modulate our rental rates accordingly. Juan Sanabria : Okay great and just hoping you could speak on sort of development return expectations what you\u2019re penciling in now and how maybe that\u2019s changed. And if the spread at all has compressed between development expectations for cash-on-cash return\u2019s versus stabilized acquisition yields to see if maybe the disincentive \u2013 or there is less of an incentive for third-party developers to put capital to work to put your product in the ground? Ron Havner : Well, I think that third-party developers, as you\u2019ve seen the expansion of the CFO [ph] pipelines from our public competitors I think there\u2019s still a big development margin or incentive economic return for them to develop properties, given what appears to me the price per foot that are being paid for these CFO deals versus our best guess of what we could develop product for in those markets. So as long as that big spread to develop product for in those markets. So as long as that big spread \u2013 in other words as long as people are willing to pay retail price is at the property stabilized versus what it costs to build, I think there\u2019s real economic incentive for them to continue. With respect to us, we don\u2019t have a per say, we\u2019re going to build $200 million or build $300 million in this year. It\u2019s really predicated on what are the opportunities. And they could be in LA, as I mentioned or Seattle or redevelopment opportunities. But we have our teams pretty well built out, we\u2019ve got a good team, we\u2019ve got some seasoned young adults, so we can go in a variety of directions with respect to our development teams, and if deals don\u2019t make sense and we\u2019re not going to build in that market. Juan Sanabria : Okay, what kind of returns are you targeting for your pipeline or sorry if I missed it? Ron Havner : Generally 8% to 10% stabilized cash on cash, but that\u2019s going to be a couple of years out. Juan Sanabria : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes in on George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yes, I guess one question on the financing front, looking at the preferred you have, I think it is too series that are currently callable. And just based on kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the preferred markets, then also on potential for issuing unsecured debt, kind of what are your capital plans for the year? John Reyes : Capital plans with respect to our preferred, specifically the redeemed the ones that will be become redeemable or redeemable over the course of 2017 will have almost 1.7 billion of preferreds that are a callable at our option, I think the average coupon is like 5.7% I think today George if we went out and tried to first off I don\u2019t think we can issue $1.7 billion of preferred second, I think the coupon that if we could go out and do a preferred today is probably higher than 5.7%. So it\u2019s certainly doesn\u2019t make sense for us to call or refinanced preferreds that are callable now with new preferreds because all we are doing is just swapping rate and not really gaining anything. And I think probably what you\u2019re kind of alluding to is what we issue unsecured debt to take out the preferreds we might \u2013 we might do some of that I wouldn\u2019t say no to that. We can probably issue 30 year debt probably 100 basis points lower than that from what our preferreds are at 10 year maybe another 100 below that. So we\u2019re looking at it, but we haven\u2019t made any decision jet on how we\u2019re going to do or what we\u2019re going to do with those preferreds becoming callable. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks. And then can you also just comment on the Shurgard performance in the fourth quarter. Ron Havner : Sure, Shurgard same-store NOI was up 9.8% and that was due to 3% revenue growth, and 5.7% reduction in expenses mainly from various adjustments and lower marketing year-over-year. So 9.8% best performing market was Holland up 22% and the worst was the UK down 5%. George Hoglund : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of David Corak with FBR Capital. David Corak : John, I just wanted to follow up on a trend that you pointed out to us on the last call and that was the idea that the \u2013 end of quarter occupancy in the contract rent change were predictive of the rental income change in the following quarter. And so if we look at the 3Q numbers they were once again pretty accurate in predicting the before rate rental income change this quarter. But, looking into 1Q, the same math what kind of implied rental growth decelerates to low four range, which would imply deceleration is actually picking up a little bit. So could you give us some color on just how you see that playing out if there\u2019s anything different with the math that you guys are thinking about on that end? John Reyes : The numbers that you just rattled off I mean that\u2019s you know those are factually correct. And I do think they are good indicators so I think I would leave it at that without giving any of our \u2013 we don\u2019t give forecasts as you know. But obviously the deceleration continues, because you could see that in the numbers. I would say this is that I think the degree of the deceleration is slowing down but I still think deceleration is happening in many, many markets that we operate in. David Corak : Okay, I guess the point was just the opposite of that is that those kind of numbers might in tell the deceleration is actually could be more pronounced from 4Q to 1Q then 3Q to 4Q, so I was just curious on that. But, I\u2019ll leave it that, all right guys, thanks. John Reyes : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gwen Clark with Evercore. Gwen Clark : Hi good afternoon. Can you just run us through the revenue and NOI performance of your major markets in the fourth quarter please? John Reyes : Gwen, this is John. So I\u2019ll give you the top ten markets. So Los Angeles, I\u2019m going to start with revenues. So Los Angeles was up 6.5%, San Francisco $4.9%, New York 3%, Chicago 2.5%, Seattle-Tacoma market for us is 8%, Washington DC 2.9%, Miami $4.4%, Dallas Fort Worth area 4.9%, Houston minus or negative 1.3%, Atlanta was up 6.5%. So that was revenues. Gwen Clark : I\u2019ll give you in a way, in a way Los Angeles 7.6%, San Francisco 5.7%, New York down 2%, Seattle up 8.3%, Washington DC up 1.2%, Chicago up 12.5%, Miami 0.8%, Dallas up 8.6%, Atlanta 10.6%, and you sit down 3.2%. Ron Havner : I will give you NOI. NOI Los Angeles 7.6%, San Francisco 5.7%, New York down 2%, Seattle up 8.3%, Washington DC up 1.2%, Chicago up 12.5%, Miami 0.8%, Dallas up 8.6%, Atlanta 10.6%, and Houston down 3.2%. Gwen Clark : Okay, thanks. So it looks like LA and San Francisco are both slowing despite having not a ton of new supply, for the results in the quarter were better or worse than what you expected going in. Ron Havner : I think they were pretty good, but last year we and San Francisco and LA we had \u2013 LA had 7.3% revenue growth that\u2019s down to 6.5% and San Francisco at 6.6% it\u2019s down to $4.9%. Still great growth numbers, but the there\u2019s no way we could continue with 7% or 8% Gwen Clark : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Hi, I know you touched on the different data points earlier this part of various the questions, but I guess from bigger picture standpoint, when you\u2019re thinking about your setup for heading into the spring and the summer high period. How do you think it stacks up heading into 2017 high period compared to last year? John Reyes : I am not sure you understand the question, Mike. But I think that what we\u2019re going to experience just like everyone else is difficult comps going into Q2, Q3 at least for us we didn\u2019t really see the deceleration start until probably April, May of last year. So Q1, Q2 of this year, we are still confidence against very tough comps only get around to Q3, Q4 we\u2019ve already seeing decelerations of the comps, all the things being equal should be you know easier for us. I don\u2019t know if that answered your question, Mike, but it doesn\u2019t please rephrase. Michael Mueller : Yes, it does to integrate. But also when you\u2019re taking a look at setting up rental increases for this year compared to last year. Is that expected to have some similar increases? Because I think, you said that the poor tenants you\u2019ve been there over year, it\u2019s about the same size as it was last year. John Reyes : Yes, we don\u2019t know yet, Mike, I mean, the pull is the same but I\u2019m not sure, at the end of the day those are going to be as sticky as they happen in the past. So I don\u2019t want to say they\u2019re not but I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know yet I am hoping they are sticky as they have in the past but we don\u2019t know. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Landon Park : Hi, every one this is Landon Park on for Vikram. Just wanted to touch base if you can give us any sense on the expense side for the 2017 any one time items we should be aware of or the cadence there. Ron Havner : Landon, my guess is expenses will be somewhere in the 3% to 4% range with the caveat that winter is not over so snow is always a variable. And the other variable is advertising expense. And my guess is we will be doing more advertising in 2017 than 2016. But that is a month by month decision. So I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to be for the year, but my guess is it will be higher than it was last year, so kind of core expense growth 3% to 4%, the biggest driver of which is property taxes which is going to be 4.5% to 5% again. Landon Park : Okay. That is helpful. Thanks for that color. And then just one more, just from a philosophical standpoint on new supply coming online, how do you guys have your systems set up to react to that at any given market. Ron Havner : In terms of our operating system? Landon Park : In terms of our \u2013 do you guys generally just sort of try to weather the storm or do you try to directly compete with new properties or how do you guys deal with that? Ron Havner : Well. Sometimes there is new supply added to one of our properties, a new development or whatever but it\u2019s on a backstreet or it\u2019s not well-managed or not built properly. And it really does not impact us. So as long as we are seeing the move in volume and the rates are holding, we don\u2019t do anything. And then other times a new competitor will come into the market and maybe cut off the street. And so we have to be more aggressive in terms of our pricing and promotion. So it\u2019s a property by property kind of reaction to what is happening. We do not sit back and say, okay, Houston is going to have 2 million square feet delivered and therefore, our rental rates, we\u2019re going to cut our rental rates by 10%. That\u2019s not the way we manage the revenue. It is property by property, space by space. Landon Park : Okay. And have you guys seen any changes in trade areas or how do you guys think about the average trade area for your properties. Ron Havner : Well. Generally our customer base is in three to five-mile radius. And so that\u2019s while we focus on \u2013 so when we do development or even do acquisitions, we look at the level of competition within the trade area, the household incomes, the densities, what\u2019s the population growth and especially on developments, what we knows in the hopper in terms of other people developing product and what is our guest in terms of what that\u2019s going to do in terms of competition per person in that marketplace. Landon Park : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Belcher with Wells Fargo. Jason Belcher : Yes, hi. Just, first this is a follow-up to the preferred and debt issuance question earlier. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts around tapping the debt markets in Europe versus the U.S.? John Reyes : We have not, even though we have issued euro denominated debt, but we didn\u2019t actually go to Europe and do that or with European investors for that matter. We issued that debt to U.S. insurance companies. I don\u2019t think we would probably issue, go to Europe and issue euro denominated bonds. I think our next \u2013 if we do issue unsecured debt would be here in the U.S., it would be U.S. dollar loans. Jason Belcher : Okay, thanks. I didn\u2019t quite get what you said earlier would you mind please repeat those levels were you said you thought you could issue 10-year and 30-year debt currently. John Reyes : I think 30-year were probably down in 4.5 or 6 and maybe 10 years probably like 3.6 kind of range, but to be honest with you I don\u2019t have exact numbers, because we haven\u2019t really talked to any bankers about that. Jason Belcher : Okay, thanks a lot. John Reyes : You\u2019re welcome. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : Michael Bilerman. Ron, can you remind us when you are talking about the 8 to 10 stabilize cash on can yields on development? When you are modeling that out now a few years out, how much street rate growth are you effectively embedding into getting to that 8 to 10? Ron Havner : Zero. Michael Bilerman : So it is based on current rate going forward. Ron Havner : Yes. The development group goes to the pricing group and gets the pricing by space size for that particular submarket. So there is kind of a independence check and balance right the pricing group versus the development group. And that\u2019s what they use and then we underwrite to a 90% occupancy even though we tend to operate higher than that we underwrite to a 90% occupancy and we do not include tenant insurance or merchandizing that number. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then, I don\u2019t know if anything on the move-in or move-out activity in terms of the space size. I mean, is there been any upsizing or downsizing of existing customers that still find that they have a need for storage, as a need based product. But they need a larger space or feel that rates have gotten too high, so they figured out a way to get their stuff into a smaller box. I just wondered if there are any of those trends that you are seeing at all. Ron Havner : The relationship between square foot occupancy and unit occupancy is pretty consistent year-over-year. And so that would tell me that there\u2019s been no shift. If you have sometimes you\u2019ll see in a property a big difference between the unit occupancy and the square foot occupancy. So you\u2019re selling out of your big units right way and so there is a big difference between the two. But the relationship over time those ratios really haven\u2019t changed in the last \u2013 I have not seen them quite a while. John Reyes : Yes, Michael this is John. So, we do have a lot of times tenants who are occupying a larger space will downsize or transfer as we call them internally into smaller sizes. So this past year about 70,000 folks basically downsized that compares to 70,000 last year too. So it was about \u2013 it is almost exactly the same. Michael Bilerman : And maybe I could ask one more, is that okay. Ron Havner : Sure. Michael Bilerman : If you think about larger facilities, so thinking development there currently has been a trend were some of the larger facilities have gotten built adding more units adding more supply I think about what you have done here in New York a number of years ago in that project as you look forward in your development pipeline how do you see that shift changing in terms of overall aggregate size of a self storage facility. Ron Havner : Overall if you look at our development pipeline, it\u2019s certainly larger than the properties we built 10 or 15 years ago. But we do not \u2013 in the real estate group we do not sit down and say, okay, we want to target 100,000 square feet or 150,000 square feet. It\u2019s really predicated on the opportunity. So like the Jersey City building, we said okay, can we do 250,000 square foot in that particular location, can we build it out, does it make economic sense. If the building had been half that size and something else had been joined it, we do the same underwriting analysis and so we\u2019d have 125,000 square foot properties instead of a 250,000 square foot property. And the same goes for the land lots in terms of being in particular submarket, how big is the lot, what is the zoning, can we go, do we have to stay single story, can we get three story or four story in that particular jurisdiction. So there is a lot of things that influence the particular size of the property other than just absolute \u2013 can we go as big as we can. That makes sense. Michael Bilerman : Yes. All right, thank you. Ron Havner : A lot of jurisdictions won\u2019t let us go above three stories and we like to build five stories because the zoning is very restrictive. But we can\u2019t get more than three stories. Michael Bilerman : Right. Okay, thank you. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Clem for any closing remarks. Clem Teng : I appreciate everybody\u2019s attendance at our conference call today. And we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Have a good afternoon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Ron Havner : Thank you, Clem. Good morning everyone, we had another solid quarter, so we're going to open up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : I was wondering if you could comment on how your markets performed in the quarter and which markets outperformed and underperformed your expectations. Ron Havner : I'll answer that a couple of ways and then John can add to it. In our top 20 markets across the platform, every market had a lower growth rate than last year. So last quarter, it was 80%, our revenue base was down year over year, this quarter it was 100%. With respect to the most challenged markets, they remain Denver and Houston, which had same store revenue growth, Houston was down 1.4%, Denver was down 1.1%. Our best markets, Tampa was up 7.1, Seattle 6.7, West Palm Beach 6.5 and Los Angeles 6.2. So those have been strong markets and they continue to be strong markets. But again every market was down year-over-year in terms of growth rate. Gaurav Mehta : And as a follow-up, it seems like you advertising and selling expense an uptick in the quarter. So does that really reflect that you\u2019re spending more money to get there and sell by advertising more? Ron Havner : Yes, we've increased both television and Internet spend and we expect to do that, increase it again in Q2. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : I guess just thinking about the moderation and how it's trended and I\u2019m not sure if it's black or white, one or the other combination of both. But as you look across the markets, I mean how much of I guess the headwind that you\u2019re pumping up against in terms of the growth rate which you say is just really driven by new supply in the markets as opposed to you had years of really great increases and just bumping up against those increases regarding of supply. Ron Havner : Hey Mike, this is Ron. I'd say there's a couple of factors, we certainly had above historical trend line growth the last four years or so. If you take a 20 year average, same-store revenue growth and Granite same stores change, it\u2019s about 3.9% to 4%, so we've been above trend line through 2016, I think 2012 to 2016 was above trend line. So we're coming back down towards trend line.  The second thing is new supply, as you indicated and the third which I actually think is probably a bigger factor is macro factors affecting our customers. If you look at trends in credit card delinquencies, charge-offs, auto loans delinquencies and charge offs, if you look at the aggregate amount of consumer debt in both credit cards, auto loans and student loans, over 3 trillion that's up about 800 billion in the last four years. So you're seeing a variety of things where the consumer which is basically our customer is stretched in or understressed. You see it also in companies like Nestle and Unilever that are reporting declining year-over-year sales. And for us we've seen an uptick in delinquent tenant sales for the last two to three quarters and a decline in merchandise sales, locks and boxes. So I'd say it is more than just supply, I\u2019d say that in general the customer is under a little stress and that's why across the platform you see things like same-store revenue growth declining year-over-year in terms of growth rates not absolute decline, but the growth rates, you know, the rate of growth declining. Operator : Your next question comes the line of David Corak with FBR. David Corak : Just looking at the supply data that's kind of floating around out there and the folks commenting on it. There seems to be some debate as to which year is going to be peak starts versus peak deliveries versus kind of peak absorption. I'd love to get your opinion on that. But my question really has to do with the amount of kind of cumulative product that's actually in lease up. So if we assume kind of a three-year lease up period by the time we get to the back half of \u201918, we would theoretically have a lot of the \u201816 deliveries, all of the \u201917 deliveries, and all of the \u201918 deliveries in lease up, which ballpark could mean you know pick a number, but maybe 2,000 stores will be leasing up at once. Does that really matter or is it just the first lease up season that impactful to fundamentals or should we kind of be thinking about this in a completely different way. Ron Havner : I think your analysis is pretty good. And in terms of when you know how long lease up impacts the surrounding competitors that really depends on the pricing and marketing strategy of the operator. For us, we will continue to be aggressive in terms of pricing, promotional discounts and marketing until we reach what we've stabilized 92%. And by stabilize, I don't mean that just hits 92%, that means that it's operating at that level for a period of a year or two. But I think your analysis is right, somewhere between 2,250 hundred properties in lease up over the next couple of years at least. David Corak : And then just to follow up on that just in terms of your specific development pipeline. You guys have been historically conservative relative to some of your peers with your 90%, 92% stabilized occupancy not trending rents, lease-up timelines et cetera. But with the deal that you don't done recently or under recently, have any of these assumptions changed from how you\u2019re looking at those maybe a year ago. I mean we\u2019ve heard some reports from developers that are trending rents down over the next couple years. Ron Havner : Now when we underwrite a development, we use spot rate that we get in the pricing group, we don't make forecasts of what rates are going to be over the next three to five years and we don't underwrite ten insurance or merchandise sales. And we underwrite a 90% occupancy with that cost of money to fill up at 8% and that's not changed over the last year or two. As rates moderate and come down in markets certainly in the market like Houston or Denver as rental rates come down because occupancies are down. It will make it hard for us to underwrite new developments because our return requirements haven't changed. And so if rates are coming down that's going to eliminate a lot of potential product that we might otherwise have underwritten a year or two ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Todd Thomas : Ron, occupancy trended lower throughout the quarter in the same store portfolio and there was a little bit more of a year-over-year decrease at March 31. Are you seeing signs that occupancy stabilizing maybe you can provide an update on how occupancies trended since the end of the quarter. John Reyes : Todd, this is John, it's pretty - occupancy negative spreads has pretty much been consistent. What problem that we're experiencing aside from all the things that Ron touched upon is what that's resulting in for us is a softness in demand into our system. And we're spending more money to get to basically maintain this almost the same level of demand as we had last year. But one of the things that I wanted to point out is that at least with respect to the move out volumes, our move out volumes are pretty much still intact, the long-term tenant is still staying put. So it's really on the front end on the move in to try to backfill the vacates that we are experiencing softness in. Todd Thomas : And then, I guess given some of that occupancy loss or the challenge in you know back filling some of the move outs at the margin is due to some of the new capacity that's entering the system. And I guess given Ron's comments that there could be 2,000 or 2,500 new facilities developed in the years ahead. I mean we do expect to continue to see those challenges persist where occupancy could continue to trend lower a bit from here forward. John Reyes : I think one of two things like happen either we'll try to re-stabilize the occupancy and move it back up, but that might may result in more discounting and lowering street rates. Right now, our street rates are up about 2% to 3%. We're discounting probably on par with where we were last year. So we're at the moment trying to hold rates and keep this level discounting at somewhat flat. But yes, it could get to a point where maybe we have to throw the towel in and start cutting rates and getting more occupancies, I mean get more discounts to stabilize the occupancy more. Ron Havner : Todd, also let me clarify. I'm not forecasting that future developments of 2,500 facilities, the gentlemen asking the question was just saying you know you have three to four years of 500 to 700 properties being developed and it's a three year fill up, so do the math, you're going to have 2,250 properties across the country filling up in 2018 and 2019. So that's not a future forecast. The second thing to John's point, if you looked at occupancy across the top 20 markets, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, Tampa are pretty darn full, there's not a lot we can do in terms of occupancy growth. You have gaps down in occupancy in Denver, Houston, Chicago that are weighing in terms of the portfolio into the year-over-year negative occupancy growth. So we can't move customers from San Francisco, we're full over to Houston. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Just a question on the supply. Do you have a number you feel comfortable sharing at this point on 2018 supply given where we stand today and how does that compare to what you expect for the full-year this year. Ron Havner : I don't have a forecast for 2018. The way I try to triangulate in terms of what I - new supply coming out of the market and what is the rate of change in that is looking at CofO deals of the other public companies disclose as well as what I know our own development pipeline to be. But I think the 2018 numbers are still evolving. The only company that reported is Extra Space, they reported a pretty good uptick in CofO pipeline for 2018. I know Life Storage just said they're out of the CofO deal market. So I don't expect them to report much, but I think for everyone the 2018 pipelines are still somewhat evolving. Juan Sanabria : How are you guys thinking about Street rate growth going into the second quarter and I guess throughout the balance of the year given the pressures on supply and your comments about a softer consumer or demand environment. Do you think that 2% to 3% holds or do you see risk to the downside on Street rate growth? John Reyes : I mean it\u2019s hard to tell, I mean, every market is so different, for example, Sacramento, which is probably our best performing market right now, Street rates are up 10.3%. And then on the other extreme you have Houston down 8.1% and everything in between. So it's really on a market by market basis and we\u2019ll just have to react as necessary to try to continue to maintain some level of revenue growth. Ron Havner : As John mentioned earlier, we have uptick marketing both television and Internet, so we're trying to drive more flow into the system. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : So you just mentioned Houston [indiscernible] down 8%, I think earlier you mentioned same store revenue was about only 1% though. So can you help me understand that does that mean eventually Houston same-store revenue has to get worse all of equal or is there something offsetting like occupancy that's making up the entire difference? John Reyes : No, if it stays down at negative 8% for an extended period of time then yes, it continues to drive down revenue growth year-over-year. Ki Bin Kim : But I guess I asked that too simply. I guess what I meant was, how much time does it take to actually lead into the results where more reflects that minus 8% you think, will it take a couple of years or it can be like quick as a year. John Reyes : Well I get it, if Houston stayed down 8% right now, I would expect that by the end of the year, we probably could be very close to 8% year-over-year reduction. Ki Bin Kim : On the contract rates that you quote in your press releases, is there a big difference between the walk in rate, contract rate versus just the only online advertised contract rate year-over-year. Is there any diversions? John Reyes : Yes. We do offer a discounted rate if somebody comes to us through our website, makes the reservation and then moves in. That discount could range anywhere from I think 5% to as high as 15%. Ki Bin Kim : John, I guess what I meant was on a year-over-year basis. I realize online is cheaper, but like it has one trended better than the other. John Reyes : I\u2019m not sure I followed your question. Ki Bin Kim : Well meaning I realize online rates are always lower almost. But the year-over-year change in that is it worse than lock-in rate? Ron Havner : Do you mean has the promotional discount changed on the Internet version last year? Ki Bin Kim : Yes, in effect, [indiscernible] rate was holding more steady or so. Ron Havner : There's a channel shift key to mobile and the web from Rocket, and almost all customers are shopping the web before they're making a reservation. So by that process, you\u2019re getting more customers through the web and therefore more customers are getting the so to speak web discount. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : I guess first of all, if you could comment on the Shurgard\u2019s performance? Ron Havner : Sure. Shurgard's same stores revenue was up 1.7%, expenses were down 2.6, same store NOI was up 4.8. Occupancies were down 90 bps 89.8 versus -- down to 89 and rates were up modestly. Best markets, France was up 5.3, Holland 7.7, and UK down 1.7, and Denmark down 1.2. George Hoglund : And then just one thing going back to the increases in operating expenses, the repairs in maintenance were up about 12% kind of what drove that large increase? Ron Havner : I wouldn't read too much into it, gates are broken, the apartments get repaired, roads get fixed. So there's the baseline RNM and then there's things that need to get done on the spot. So I think the increase is 5 million bucks. George Hoglund : And then just one last one just any update on thoughts about issuing unsecured and maybe taking out some of the preferreds. John Reyes : We're still evaluating that, something that's very high topic on our minds. So we're still looking at that right now. Ron Havner : No decision has been made. George Hoglund : Any sense on if you were to do inaugural unsecured deal where it might price. Ron Havner : Well, I believe the best spread of any REIT. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just to clarify, so Street rate growth in the 2% to 3% range, is that - it seems to be higher than last quarter if I\u2019m not wrong where I think you\u2019d mentioned more like 1% is that correct? John Reyes : And I don't recall what last quarter was, I mean that's where we are today. I could tell you like in January we were about up 1%, February we were up 4%, March we were up 3%, no we are about 2% to 3% somewhere in that neighborhood. It just it varies. Vikram Malhotra : And then just as we think about sort of the folks taking or getting the web rate versus the in store rate, would you suspect over time as you just have more and more people going to the web eventually just to have more people gravitating to that web rate. And can you give us what the split is today between those actually on the web getting the web rate versus the in-store? John Reyes : I don't have that split but I would be willing to bet that the majority, the vast majority of the people come to us are getting the web rate. Either they're getting it through our website or desktop website or a mobile website. Walk-in traffic has really shrunk over the years as the Internet as well as mobile has become more predominant in people\u2019s everyday lives. Vikram Malhotra : So effectively, am I correct just to clarify and say, when you talk about Street rate growth, it's really is much more driven by the change in the web rate growth. John Reyes : Well, last year we were doing 15% reduction and this year we're doing 15% reduction in the same thing. I mean that's what - I'm saying what the 3% - 2% to 3% would be. So that hasn't changed. I mean year-over-year the rates that we're telling you it's not worse than the 2% or 3%, even though we're getting more - we're doing the 15% discount because we're doing that last year. Do you mean the discount on the web, we've been doing that for years now, many years. Vikram Malhotra : No, no, I understand that rate is lower, I'm just saying say, next year you take that same web rate and change it by X, your overall Street rate would be somewhat of a blend of the in-store that you - at that some smaller proportion of people [indiscernible] versus the web, but increasingly the change in the web will be driving your Street rate growth. John Reyes : Yes, and that's why in the past I've talked about kind of disregarded Street rate, we\u2019ve talked about move in rates because that's the more relevant metric. Is what are people actually moving in at after you take away whether they got a web discount or no discount. But I could tell you for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year, the moving in rate was about flat and notwithstanding the fact they just told you that the rates were up about 2% to 3% end of Q1, the actual take rate was flat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : As mentioned earlier that you thought one of the issues overall in the industry is consumer just weakness and macro concerns. Just in your history with the space, if the economy were to improve significantly or the consumer sort of feels better. How long does that take to sort of translate over to increased usage in storage or being more likely to take higher prices? Ron Havner : Smedes, I would say if you look at where we are today, unemployment is about 4.5%, we're back down to where we were in 2007. So we\u2019re going to drop to an unemployment rate of 3.5% nationwide I think that's a little hard and some markets have 2.5% to 3% unemployment rate. But I don't see that happening. And barring that, I don't know what's really going to improve things for the consumer. If levered up and everyone's employed and so, like I said, you're seeing in a variety of factors in terms of the stress that the average consumer is having. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you too, you discussed for a while there the web rate versus the in-store rates and as consumers continue to move to web rates, do you think this also -- so there would be -- it\u2019s considered such a three to five mile business from someone's home, but as rates become more and more transparent and competitive, have you seen any sense that consumers are willing to drive further in order to chase lower rates available on the web? John Reyes : The other day I did a study of consumers coming into our New Jersey city property, which has very aggressive promotional rates and there is certainly a number of customers coming outside the historical three mile radius. We're getting people from the Bronx, from Brooklyn, from distant parts of New Jersey. So people are definitely migrating or figuring out a way to get to our Jersey City property. And we saw the same thing in Gerard when we opened that up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Gwen Clark with Evercore. Gwen Clark : Can you run through the top 10 market performance on revenue and NOI? I know you went through a bit of it, but if you could just say them all, that would be helpful. John Reyes : So Los Angeles, which is our biggest market by far, which represents about 15% of our revenue was up 6.2%. San Francisco, 4.7%; New York was up 2.8%; Chicago, 2%; Miami was up 3.3%; Washington DC, 2.6%; Atlanta; 4.6%; Seattle, 6.7%; Houston was down 1.4% and Dallas was up 3.5%. Those were the top 10 markets we have. Ron Havner : Gwen, that\u2019s revenue growth. Gwen Clark : Okay. Is it possible to do NOI also? Ron Havner : Sure. Los Angeles was up 7.5%. San Francisco, 5%. New York, 2.4%. Chicago, 0.3%. Miami, 2%. DC, 0.6%. Atlanta, 5%. Seattle, 6.6%. Houston, down 4.2% and Dallas, up 2.3%. Gwen Clark : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. One other quick thing. You gave the Denver growth rates for the first quarter, is it possible to get the revenue growth in Denver for the fourth quarter? Ron Havner : Denver was down 1.1%. Gwen Clark : In the first quarter? Ron Havner : Yes. Gwen Clark : And do you know what it was in the fourth quarter? Ron Havner : In the fourth order, I do not have that here. No. Gwen Clark : Okay. Separately, on the acquisition front, can you talk about the rationale to continue to buy sites at softening macro environment and weak rental rates? I do understand that you're not buying much, but if you could just walk us through the rationale that would be great. Ron Havner : Well, I'd say we're not buying much, so it's harder product to pencil, given the environment. If I talk about the acquisition environment as a whole, I'd say today, there's quite a gap between buyer and seller. We're not seeing much product come to market and the product that we are seeing is of lower quality. Not a lot of deals, transacting, It's a much different market than just a year ago where we were still in the, I would call it, the lay other stages of the feeding frenzy and that has certainly dissipated. People are much more cautious and as someone mentioned obviously, potential buyers are underwriting much more conservative, probably street rates as well as growth rates. So the acquisition environment overall has changed quite a bit over the last year. Operator : You have a question from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : Hey, Ron. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman. I had a couple of questions. You talked a little bit about increased marketing spend. Can you talk about the other aspect of promotional discounts, you've been running around 80 million, 83 million in the last couple of years. I guess, what's the cadence right now in terms of your promotional discounts that we should be thinking about to stimulate increased activity. Ron Havner : Michael, actually Q1, our promotional discounts were down slightly year-over-year about $700,000. But that\u2019s in part rates were, as John touched on, basically flat and move in volume was down. So assuming move in volume picks up with respect due to television and Internet marketing, and I would expect the absolute dollar of move in discounts to increase. Michael Bilerman : So the spread between move ins and move outs which had been a negative drag in \u201916, what was it in the first quarter? John Reyes : In the aggregate, Michael or you want it by monthly rates. Michael Bilerman : I guess just in the aggregate, that would be helpful. John Reyes : Yeah. I think it would be much more helpful. So in the aggregate, the rent rollout between move ins and move outs first quarter of 2017 was about 1.09 million negative. That compares to about 700,000 negative roll down in Q1 of 2016. Michael Bilerman : And where are you right now in your annual rent increases that you're pushing through, because that\u2019s at least a helpful offset to drive revenue growth? John Reyes : We're still moving forward with the same strategies we\u2019ve had since the past couple of years. I'll be much more cautious in terms of how we're doing it and testing the waters to make sure that we're not disrupting the length of stay in the long term tenant, but so far and it's really early, so far, nothing has led us to believe that we should change that strategy yet. Michael Bilerman : And then just the balance sheet corporate structure question, Ron, we had talked, I think it was last year when you were inverted on a multiple basis, an implied cost of equity to where your preferred is and you're probably 25, maybe 40 basis points wide today, do you have any thought to a stock buyback, given where your implied multiple and equity cost is. Ron Havner : Well, Michael, the preferred market, if you recall post our 4.9% issuance last October, really backed up those issues traded down. We have seen some modest resumption of activity in the preferred market and interest rates have come back down post the Trump election. So we'll wait and see what happens, but I can tell you at the forefront, for John and I, in terms of capital allocation, we're always looking at, are we doing development, are we doing acquisitions that we'd be doing share repurchases. We're looking at that menu all the time. Michael Bilerman : Yes. And how it's still your pecking order, your preferreds are probably 5 in a quarter and your implied equity is probably in the high-4s with growth that\u2019s still coming, so I just thought the math could work today and I didn't know how aggressive you would actually want to be? Ron Havner : Well, as you can see from our balance sheet, we have tremendous financial flexibility to do whatever creates the most meaningful value for shareholders. Michael Bilerman : I don't know if that's a yes or not, but I will yield the floor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up. Ron, I wanted to just circle back again to the comments you made about the macro factors impacting the business a bit and as we think about self-storage as a needs based product or service, I'm not sure I fully understand your comments whether you've witnessed a change to consumer behavior as it pertains to self-storage at all or if you're simply just saying that the consumer appears to be sort of stretched or tapped out a bit? Ron Havner : The latter. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then -- Ron Havner : And why do I say that Todd, well, we opened Jersey City 60 days ago, 4000 units, 10% occupied. We opened Red Hill down in Irvine, California little less than a year ago, 3000 units, it\u2019s 55% occupied. So there's no change in customer behavior. Our volumes are still good across the platform, but just not as robust as they were. So when you start to think about why aren't they as robust, unemployment's flattening out and the customer -- our customer has a fair number of headwinds that they\u2019re facing. But their use of storage is building. Todd Thomas : Okay. And would you say that the use of storage from some of the different sources of demand is consistent throughout also, students moving related activity commercial uses. Have you seen any change to any one of those different sources of demand? Ron Havner : We don't track that, but we haven't seen any change. Our college properties are still behaving as our college properties, but we have commercial tenants around us. They're still behaving the same way, but in terms of absolute change, I couldn't tell you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Ron, is there any reason why development should really slow down at this point. Ron Havner : Is that a question for Public Storage or is that a macro question? Ki Bin Kim : Macro. Ron Havner : Macro. Well, if you're a local developer or a regional developer and you've decided to build, you probably have created an infrastructure for yourself, you\u2019ve hired site acquisition people, you\u2019ve hired construction people, you've hired development people and you're developing and you've got this overhead. And more likely than not, given the way developers behave as you're going to continue to build until the capital dries up. Now, it has made sense for these local regional people to build because they are monetizing their developments, unoccupied at 1.5 to 2 times what it cost to build a product.  So if you're that person and you can monetize it at those multiples to cost, you're going to build as much as you can. The challenge then for that person is, as the market changes, as buyer expectations change and buyers dial back their -- the multiple of costs that they're willing to pay or don't even want to buy. As I mentioned, Life Storage just said we're out of that market. So as buyers kind of dissipate, then those developers are stuck with the product and they will build out, assuming they have the financial capability, they will build out the product, but then they will slow down and/or stop development. Ki Bin Kim : And just gut opinion, how far are we from any kind of slowdown or is this still kind of a green light, besides that? Ron Havner : Well as long as you can do that, so the fundamental economics will take a back seat, so there was a self-storage convention, I think a month or month and a half ago and my guys told me, it was a record attendance. So I would say that and the word is develop, develop, develop. So I'd say we're a ways from the new product supply slowing down. Ki Bin Kim : And maybe I just missed this, but I don't see where you're developing in some of your releases. Apologies if I just missed it, but can you just talk about where your development projects are? Ron Havner : Sure. Our largest market is Texas. Dallas and Houston where we've been developing for quite a while. Texas is, our pipeline is 5.2 million square feet. So Texas is half of that. California is about 1 million square feet. Colorado is 0.5 million. Ohio is 100,000. Florida is 300,000. Washington, state of Washington is 3. Seattle is 342,000. North Carolina's 170,000 and then it kind of spreads across a variety of other states. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. If I could just squeeze one more in? Ron Havner : I think that\u2019s three, isn\u2019t it? Ki Bin Kim : I was wondering if, given the kind of slot Texas is in, longer term it's not really that much of a concern, is that why you're comfortable doing Texas at this point. Ron Havner : Well, this is stuff key, we have under construction. So we made a decision last year to build and so we bought the line and we're building. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jon Hughes with Raymond James. Jon Hughes : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just two for me. Could you clarify the Houston rental rate growth number? Was that down 8% from last year's rate or did the growth in rental rate flow from positive 7% last year to negative 1% this year. John Reyes : That's where the Houston Street rate growth is year-over-year as of yesterday. Jon Hughes : Okay. So it\u2019s actually down 8% year-over-year. Ron Havner : It is used in revenue growth -- same store revenue growth for the first quarter was down 1.4%. Jon Hughes : Right. And it was up 6.8% last year on a perfect basis? I was asking if the actual rate was down 8% or if it just slowed to 8%? Ron Havner : No, it's down. The street rate that we are asking today is down 8% versus the street rate we were asking last year. Jon Hughes : Okay. And then one more supervisory payroll and allocated overhead, that\u2019s included in same store expenses increased about 7% year-over-year. What drove that increase and is this expected to moderate through the rest of the year? Ron Havner : The increases, a few more district managers, some pay increases and then Joe Russell who's running operations is in that number. So he popped into that number I think in the third quarter of last year. So it'll be up year-over-year through the second quarter and then it will be moderate in the third and fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Burke with Green Street Advisors. Ryan Burke : Thanks. John, a couple of calls ago, you defined move in demand as call volume plus Internet traffic plus walk ins. And at that point, call volume was up, Internet traffic was flat and walk ins were down about 7%. Are you able to quantify what happened in those three buckets for the first quarter? John Reyes : Yeah. Let me give you -- this is just with respect to our same store, so I don't have a whole -- so we kind of allocate to our same stores, but it's pretty close the whole so to speak. So calls into our call center were up about 1%. The inquiries into our website and combining our desktop and our mobile were actually down about 5%. Walk in traffic was down 9% year-over-year for the quarter. Ryan Burke : All right. And then Ron, you mentioned the wide bit of spread between buyer and seller. How much higher would cap rates be if that spreads were to close today would you say? Ron Havner : In whose favor? Ryan Burke : In the favor that -- whatever favor it should go, in your favor, let's say. Ron Havner : Well, so the buyers are for the most part north of the trend line. Well, last year, deals were done at about 4 to 4.5 cap rates and I think we're back up to about 5.5 to 6. But again, Ryan, there's not a lot of product trading, so that's best guess number. There's not a lot of transactions to say, there's the number. Ryan Burke : Okay. So you're not saying the cap rates you think are up 100 basis points, you think that's where the buyer expectation is and maybe if there's a spread, it's up 50 basis points or? Ron Havner : Yeah. There's not enough transaction volume for me to say exactly what it is, but most -- buyer expectations were still at last year's cap rates and seller's expectations of what the purchase prices has changed. And so that gap is creating a slowdown in transaction volume. Ryan Burke : Okay. So seller expectations have actually moved higher than this time last year from a value -- property value perspective? Ron Havner : Yes. Ryan Burke : Okay. And actually last question here. In the 2016 acquisition bucket, your contract rents are down pretty meaningfully. Is that to say that you guys actually cut rents in those properties or is that more just a mix of the properties that you owned during the first quarter of last year versus those that you owned for the first quarter of this year? John Reyes : It's a mix. Ryan, the first quarter last year, we had predominantly bought some properties in Florida and higher rate markets and then throughout the year, we were buying some properties at lower rate markets, for example in the fourth quarter, we bought portfolio properties in Oklahoma City, which is a lower rate market and the Florida market. So it's just truly just a mix, it\u2019s not because we\u2019re cutting rates in those particular properties. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. I joined a little late. I know you went over some of this, but on the move in versus vacate rents, you gave some of the details there and I thought in the 10-K, you did a good job of explaining how that played out last year. And then on the first quarter, it sounds like you're saying the delta got a little bit worse versus a year ago. And so what I'm wondering is how should we think about that impact for the rest of the year and particularly what's going to help that? Is it just street rate growth going up or you\u2019re just facing just some natural high rents burn off from some of the vacates that your street rate growth can't really make up for? John Reyes : I think that obviously we would like to see the street rates get much higher than what they are today and combined with increased move in volumes or at least move in volumes better able to offset the vacate. In terms of the vacate rate, we're starting to see a slowdown in the actual rental rate, the year-over-year rental rate that they're paying. So the Delta right now is, they will be now paying about 137 bucks a month versus last year they moved out paying about 134 bucks a month. So that\u2019s about a $3 delta.  That delta has been narrowing, which is somewhat of a good thing, because it gives us a lower hurdle on the move in rate to cover. But still right now, it's about $13 negative delta between our move ins and our move out rates. So the move in rates is about 124 bucks a month. So that's the key, at least in my mind right now is to get those street rates up. But we also need to get them up with the additive moving volumes, so that we're not losing occupancy. Ron Havner : I would add that in the first quarter, there is generally a negative spread because the rental rates, the street rates are lower than they are as we head into the rental season, April, May, June, July, August. So as that plays out over the course of the year, that gap should close. We'll see whether move in rates achieve or exceed move out rates. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the conference back to Clem Teng. Clem Teng : Thank you for participating on our call and we look forward to talking to you in our second quarter. Thank you. Bye.

And good morning everyone, we had pretty good quarter, Q2. So operator let's open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Corak of FBR. David Corak : Hi, everyone. Looking at your rental income growth for the quarter, the occupancy in the contract rent formula that's historically been a pretty strong predictor of rent growth was off materially to the downside by about 60 bps and it's a first time it's been off for a while, can you just helps us understand why you think that was off so much, John? And how we should think about that going forward, I mean, it looks like the math would imply another 50 bps or so deceleration in 3Q. John Reyes : Yes. There was nothing really specific that caused that difference, I think it was just really the way the quarter had accelerated quicker than what it normally do. So the deceleration happens faster than what those numbers would normally indicate on how that quarter would predict to be out using those metrics. So there is nothing unusual other than the deceleration and how quickly that happens. David Corak : And going forward? John Reyes : Well going forward we still have those same indicators in there. So right now, if you net the two numbers that it's at about a 2.9%, I don't know what the third quarter is going to be, but it's probably going to be somewhere in the 2% to 3% range. David Corak : Okay. And then maybe a bigger picture question for you Ron. I think overall we're kind of struggling to really put our finger on what's having the most impact, on fundamentals right now on the industry whether it's the supply side, the demand side or maybe some combination there in. So maybe just very simplistically if you had to fill out kind of like a pie chart allocating the impact some percentage of supply and percentage of demand, what do you think that looks like today? And then maybe what do you think that chart looks like a year from now? Ron Havner : Well I think I step back and certainly new supplies having an impact, but I think a bigger impact on the numbers is the comps that everyone is coming off from 2015 and 2016. If you recall first quarter '16 and even second quarter most operators were pretty full, peak occupancies promotional discounts had been dial down advertising expense was nominal, but for us, we didn't know advertising in Q2 of 2016. And so the growth in terms of rental growth today is for the most part what your rental rate increases are for your existing customers and that's an offset impart by rental rate roll down because new take rates are lower than in place rents, which peaked probably in Q1 or Q2 of '16. So you have got the headwind of roll down, occupancies are still robust, but promotional discounts are certainly not going down maybe just going up modestly and then for us we're increasing advertising. So it's just incredible tough comps, I'll give you an example, Atlanta certainly has new supply but Atlanta in Q2 of 2016 had a 9.2% same-store revenue growth and came in this year at 3.3%. So that's a pretty good degradation in revenue growth, but I would tell you last year Atlanta at 9.2% it was clearly not sustainable peak occupancies, lower discounts and clearly not a sustainable number. So bigger picture it's just really tough comps peak occupancy, lower discounts and then you probably got some headwind with respect to new supply. David Corak : Okay, thanks Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, I guess good morning out there. I was just wondering if you and John could maybe talk a little bit about street rate growth and maybe how that street rate growth is trended in some of the markets that have had more supply like New York and some of the major Texas markets like Houston, Dallas and Austin? John Reyes : Steve this is John. Right now I'll tell you that our street rates are up about 2%, but that's going to change probably pretty - today it will change. We are going to start reducing the rates significantly in some of our major markets. During the - Houston for example is a market that we were down during the quarter about 15% in rates we will probably take those down a lot more. Overall our same-stores on the movement rates the take rates that are coming in were down about 4% during the quarter and we had about flat moving volume. With respect to our other major markets, I would say most of them are down to flat with few exceptions such as like Los Angeles and Seattle, but I would say most of them are fairly flat. Steve Sakwa : So John is it fair to say that Houston is kind of the market where things are the worse in terms of decline? John Reyes : Well I mean that's in terms of decline it's our worse performing market in terms of year-over-year growth, but it's not necessarily our worse performing market in terms of the deceleration. There is other markets like Ron pointed out Atlanta that is decelerating I think worse than Houston is. Steve Sakwa : Right. And could you just maybe speak specifically to New York and kind of the metro area? Ron Havner : Well New York last quarter last year had for us 3.8% revenue growth. And this year had 2.25% revenue growth, so up about 150 basis points in terms of Q2 '16 versus Q2 '17 growth. I think with New York your question is probably related to new supply, and while there is new supply in New York I don't think most of the anticipated new supply has hit the market yet. Steve Sakwa : Well. I guess that leads me into my next question broadly speaking. As Ron as you sort of look at the landscape and you've been through several cycles. What is your expectation about when new supply peaks, when would that have sort of the maximum impact or negative impact on your business? And I guess when do you sort of see things either stabilizing or turning. I mean is there still another 6, 12, 18 months from now? Ron Havner : Well, Steve it's similar to my answer from last quarter and that is we have higher deliveries this year than last year. And based on my unscientific analysis of looking at pipelines it only have - I don't have the other three publicized CofO pipeline. Yes because they have reported, but going back from last quarter, supply using that methodology new deliveries will be about 20% next year. So I'm guessing 35 million square feet could deliver this year, 43 million square feet or about 700 or 800 properties next year. So if we're hitting a peak in terms of deliveries is probably '18 and then you're going to have a year or two of absorption from that. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess just sort of last question as you sort of put all this together and you look at sort of slowing revenue, rising expenses more advertising. I mean do you or would you expect NOI growth to turn negative in this cycle and possibly happen in 2018? Ron Havner : I can't say that Steve. Because we'll increase marketing spend as necessary to drive volume. And we're coming off a low base of '16. I would be surprised if we went negative, but I can't say that that's out of the question. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yes, good morning. I was just wondering if you can comment just on the expense growth. I mean, I know you said a good portion of increases due to the tough comps. But if you can just talk some of the other just increase in advertising and sort of how much of that die to I guess not an easy comp just other factors? Ron Havner : Well at the end of Q1 we said we spend more on advertising and marketing expense and we did. That was up about $1.7 million in Q2 versus last year, I'm sorry, about $2.7 million. A $1 million of that was the internet marketing. So we went from $3.4 million to $4.4 million, and TV went from zero to $1.7 million. So our total spend on those triumphs was up $2.7 million. The other big driver is which has been constant for the last couple of years is property taxes up again about $4.5 million or $2.5 million. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks. And then just I think it was five properties that were excluded from the same store pool, can you just comment on those? Ron Havner : Those [indiscernible]. George Hoglund : Okay. In which market. Ron Havner : Houston and Carolina is I believe some of the South Carolina. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : Yes hi. So a quick question on revenue management and you touched upon that a little. But I was wondering if you are thinking about occupancy and I think you mentioned that you will start cutting rate significantly going forward? Is that an effort to maintain occupancy at current levels and would you say that you have hit the floor below, which you don't want your occupancy to go? Ron Havner : No, I think see that we advertise a lot more or we start cutting rates we do both, and we're going to experiment with more rate reductions and see what that gets us. It's not about occupancy precise we're trying to maintain a revenue growth. And so that's really our goal and so we're going to start playing with the rental rates a little bit more. Gaurav Mehta : Okay. And as a follow-up on the expense, you talked about spending more money on TV and internet, have you seen impact of that in getting new customers? Ron Havner : I have to say in Q2 the increased marketing spend, internet spend wasn't as effective as we would have liked everyone is - I could tell you everyone is paying a lot more on the internet, there is a few more competitors and the bids are higher, but it's not really changing the positioning. It's just costing more but not really driving much more volume. And TV, we got some lift in it, but it wasn't as effective as we would have liked. Gaurav Mehta : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. John, I just - I wanted to follow-up to your comments also about starting to reduce rents in some markets, I think you said significantly and also said that you would begin today. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit maybe in terms of the magnitude of some of the rent reductions and also maybe speak to some of the markets? John Reyes : Well, I can't speak as to the magnitude Todd, but the markets, I mean, you can imagine they're the usual suspects that we've been struggling with such as Houston and Denver as well as others were - our revenue growth, our occupancies, our movement volumes are under pressure. So those would be the markets that we've a target. The degree or the significance could be anywhere from 5% or whatever to 15%, 20% reduction in rates. So, don't really know, I don't know those numbers just yet, but our folks are working on them. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then just in terms of occupancy, in the context of maximizing revenue growth, do you expect to see that year-over-year occupancy gap stabilize or potentially narrow a little bit or is it a little too soon to tell? Ron Havner : Todd, it's a little hard to tell, as I've mentioned in prior quarters, the occupancy gaps are really in places like Houston and Denver, whereas Chalkville and San Francisco and Los Angeles. And so you can't really move customers. John mentioned in Houston we were down 15%, 20% of rates in the quarter and we really didn't - actually we saw negative movement volume in Houston in the quarter despite increased marketing and lower rates. So some markets are just hard to get the velocity, the movement velocity going. Todd Thomas : Okay. And just lastly if I could, real quick Ron, circling back to some comments you made last quarter, I think about macro factors and the consumer a little bit, anything new on that front, either as it pertains to the consumer or just demand in general whether you are seeing any changes to demand on the phones, web hits, reservations anything like that related to inbound enquiries to system? Ron Havner : Well, I would just say that the trends that were relevant last quarter I don't think it changed much, you've got the provision of the banks for consumer credit are continue to tick-up, delinquencies continue to tick-up, overall leverage of the consumer is still high. So those macro factors that I touched on last quarter haven't changed, if you look at our portfolio all top 20 markets had lower revenue growth year-over-year same as Q1. So we're down across the board to different degrees. The markets are somewhat changing in terms of the degradation or rate of degradation, Houston and Denver have been leading the charge. Our big decelerators this quarter were Charlotte, Portland and Atlanta. So there is a change, but in terms of which markets are decelerating a little faster, but overall all the top 20 markets are down in terms of rate of growth. Todd Thomas : Okay, thank you Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. I was just thinking if you could talk a little bit about if there is any change in behavior from your in place customer versus the incoming customers, which I think you said there is some difficultly and you have to up the promotions to get them in. But are you - it seems in the past you've had fairly consistent rate increases for you in place customers. Did you see any change there this quarter? John Reyes : Smedes this is John. We continue to send out the rental rate increases of the renewals just like we did last year. We haven't change. We're still monitoring it very closely to see if there is an uptick move activity. We haven't noticed anything. So the in place - the long-term talent still is very sticky. Length of stay still appears to be very similar, even our new incoming tenants the issue really is trying to get more demand into our system and we have lack of pricing power, which is what we were talking about in Q1. So those issues to continue to be with us. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then switching for gears, first are you seeing any change Ron on the availability of capital to the space given that fundamentals continue to decelerate and I think probably ahead of expectations clearly. Have you heard anything in terms of construction lending or equity checks required to get new construction going? Ron Havner : We've heard of tightening of construction lending. Remind you we don't - we're not people that use construction lending, but we heard of tightening of that. We've gotten a couple of calls from people asking us if we'd like to make construction loans, which would tell me obviously the banks are not making them because they're calling us. And we're seeing a few more deals - enquiries on deals where people have projects in the ground or just out of the ground that they'd like to monetize sooner rather than later. And you've seen there is a couple of packages on the market today where someone has developed four to six portfolio - 46 property portfolios and rather than waiting for them to get stabilized that putting them on the market. So I would say some of the quicker thinking developers are bringing stuff to market and then seeing that the slowdown that's happening overall. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. Just hoping if you could give us a sense of how street rates moved throughout the second quarter and into July. And just conceptually speaking all else being equal if street rates let's say go flat. How long do you think it would take for same store revenues to get to that flat level that street rates would be suggesting overtime it should get to? John Reyes : We get our street rates during Q2 you're not going to speak to that what they move-ins were doing. The move-ins came in at rates that were below last year by about I think it was about 3.7% and we had about flat move-in volume. So that would suggest that our street rates throughout the quarter were pretty much down. Currently our street rates are up about 2% for the month of July, but as I mentioned will probably be cutting many markets by varying degrees. In terms of your question about if street rates stayed flat, I think you were asking if what would that do to revenue growth. Juan Sanabria : Yes, how long would it take to get same store revenue to match that street rate growth? John Reyes : I don't know. I have no idea. Right now we're rolling down. I think Ron might have touched on that. People are moving in at about 130 bucks a month - they are moving in at about $130 a month and they're vacating at about $138 a month and that compares to last year where it's about flat where they're moving in at about $136 and vacating at $136. So, we're definitely down and that particular metric work actually accelerating. So that roll down spread has widened. Juan Sanabria : And the up 2%, where you said street rates were up 2% now versus July is that an improvement for what you saw in May and June or is that kind of fairly stable at\u2026 John Reyes : I don't recall what that was in May and June, I can't answer that. Juan Sanabria : And then just last question for me on the developments that you guys are have in place any change in terms of expected yields given kind of a softer market and or maybe longer lease up times can you remind us what you are targeting on dollars being spend today? Ron Havner : I'm sorry remind you of what our expected yields are or\u2026 Juan Sanabria : Yes. Ron Havner : When a project come out of the ground it leases up, so far the proprieties coming out of the ground are leasing up faster than we projected albeit at lower rental rates than we projected. So we're getting some benefit of lower rental rates versus greater volume and net-net that's a positive. In terms of the projects that we've so far got out on the ground, they look to be on track, but as I've said before it will be two to three years before we really have a good grasp of are we hitting the numbers or not. Q2 we're going to deliver about 16 properties million 6 square feet across five different markets the largest being Houston where we will deliver 770,000 square feet. Juan Sanabria : And just what stabilized deals do you think you will get based on kind of markets today, market rents today? Ron Havner : The market rents change every day. So I don't - mark-to-market the portfolio every day in terms of what the yield is, but so far we're on track to take somewhere between an 8% and 10% cash on cash return on cost. Juan Sanabria : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks and good morning everyone. How much is the existing cost in our rate increase program contributing to that 3.2% and same store revenue growth this quarter? John Reyes : Ki for the quarter the rental rate increases added about $400,000 of monthly contract rent, which did not offset the rent roll down we experienced, which was about $1.9 million. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. So is that the first time in a while where the existing customer rate increase program, which is I guess is lot of debate about it, but doesn't really contributed a whole lot but actually going negative. Ron Havner : It didn't go negative, it was positive $400,000. Ki Bin Kim : I think that was $400,000 plus minus $1 point something million negative. John Reyes : So the move-in and move-out equation took away because rent volume down took away about $1.9 million of monthly rent whereas the rental rate increases added about $400,000. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And is that contribution pace, do you think that would be fairly consistent even if like you said move-in rates are down 4% if that's the case the existing customer rate increase program still have the same impact going forward or do you see some risk with that? John Reyes : Well it still have - I mean, year-over-year it still has the same impact with relative to itself. But my point is that impact is not enough to offset the rent roll down on the move-in move-out volumes. Whereas in the past the move-in move-out volumes pretty much were slightly negative to flat. And so the rate increases had a much more impactful year-over-year growth that growth that we're experiencing that it does now. even notwithstanding the fact that the volume basically the same. I don't know if that make sense, but it's not as impactful because that roll down is just trumping it right now. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And are you noticing any changes in the closing rate of your call center or website or maybe the date to release the unit increasing at all? John Reyes : Well, I'll tell you that we call a production rate, our production rate which measures basically the move-in that we get versus the inquiries that we're getting are better. So we're getting a lot less inquiries, about 3% to 4% less inquiries into the various channels we have, whether it be call center, the website, either the mobile, or the desktop. But notwithstanding the fact that we're getting less, we had flat move-ins for the most part. So we're making up for it by getting better reservation rates and getting better shop rates. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. John Reyes : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Could you just maybe give us any update or anymore colors specifically around San Francisco and LA and then just the revenue growth in the top five markets, same store revenue growth? Ron Havner : Same store revenue growth top five markets Los Angeles was 5.7%, San Francisco was 3.6%, New York was 2.2%, Chicago was 1.1%, D.C. was 2.0% and Miami was 2.2%. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thank you and just especially on LA and San Francisco, anything different you're seeing this quarter in terms of street rates or just behavior from customers? Ron Havner : Not necessarily behavior from customers, and John can comment on the street rates. San Francisco Q2, 2016 had 7.2% same store growth, and it came in at 3.6%, so and Los Angeles was 7.9% last year and is up 5.74% this year. So actually those two markets were the biggest contributors to our slowdown in revenue growth, not because they're doing bad, 3.6% and 5.7% is very good, is just coming off very tough comps from 2016 of 7 plus percent revenue growth. So those two markets were almost 60 bps of our 2.7% revenue decline year-over-year. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, that's helpful. Ron Havner : 95% plus occupied, promotional discounts are good. So overall demand is very good in those markets it's just that they're coming of very tough comp. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just going back to the question on just revenue growth, I remember maybe two, three quarters ago, you had mentioned that your view is that revenue growth sort of stabilizes at long-term average, just maybe any updated thoughts around that it seems like we've dipped a little bit below long-term average. I'm just wondering where you see stabilization? Ron Havner : I believe, I said the long-term growth rate over 20 years or something like 3.4%, 3.6%, we were above trend line for about three years. So we could be below trend line from some period of time to get to overall average of that and again the overall long-term average may change from 3.4% higher or lower. But it's not surprising to me that we're below trend line given how far above trend line we went. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yes, hi. Just a question on financing, I mean, since you guys just redeemed some preferreds and you've done one of the preferred issuance, just wondering how you're thinking about preferred versus unsecured bonds going forward? And kind of where do you think you could price a 10-year and a 30-year bond and then preferreds today? John Reyes : Well, we're thinking about both, George, we're thinking about issuing unsecured, as well as maybe continuing to tapping at the preferred market both of them are open for Public Storage. Would really be what's the use of proceeds really in terms of the amount we may issue. I'm sorry, your question was what we can issue 10-year? I think is what you asked? George Hoglund : Yes, 10-year and 30-year dip? John Reyes : So 10-year we think it's maybe around the 330-ish area and the 30-year maybe about 420, 425. And that's off the top [ph] I mean, but I think it's roughly in that neighborhood. George Hoglund : Okay. And then I just would think preferred today would be similar to where your last issuance? John Reyes : I think preferred still around the same place we did the last issuance, which is end of May, early June, which was a 515. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks. John Reyes : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Couple of questions, I guess Ron and John on the development pipeline, the new development you have about 470 in process expansion of about 190, and I guess just given the backdrop and if you're working out to next year, would you imagine that your pipeline is of similar size or do you think you pull back on it a little bit? Ron Havner : At this time, I think it will be about similar size, probably a mix difference in terms of a more shift, continued shift towards redevelopments versus ground-up development. But if I look out to '18 in terms of deliveries and what we've got in our I will call it our second shadow pipeline stuff we have in the works, I think we will be close to where we are today. Michael Mueller : Got it. And I apologize, I missed the intro comments if there were any, but for the effective rate increases that went to existing customers this year, did you say what those were at this point? John Reyes : We didn't say that in our comments at the beginning of the call. Michael Mueller : Okay. John Reyes : But it was - the rate increases are similar to last year Mike roughly in the 8% to 10% range to existing tenants that qualify. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay, thank you. John Reyes : You're welcome. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Clem Teng for any closing remarks. Clem Teng : Thank you for attending our conference call. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

We had another solid quarter, and challenges with the few, Hurricanes, but overall a solid quarter. Operator let's open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : Thanks. I was wondering if you would comment on your views on rent growth versus occupancy at this point in the cycle, how you are thinking about pushing rents and occupancy? John Reyes : Hi, this is John. So our rent growth during the quarter are moving volume was down, let me start with that about 3.5% and the take rate was down about 3%. But there is very little room to really push for rental rates at the moment, because demand still remains very soft throughout the country for us. We also have a negative occupancy spread that continue to grow through the quarter, through the end of the year. And because through the end of the quarter, so I don't really see as we move forward into the fourth quarter that we're going to see a lot of traction on pushing street rates to at least over the next three to four months probably. And that's my best guess. Ron Havner : I just add to that that, again this quarter across all of our top 20 markets, revenue growth, the rate of revenue growth was down year-over-year. So we're not seen any markets with accelerating rates of revenue growth. All 20 were done, I think that's the third or fourth quarter in a row. Gaurav Mehta : Okay. And as a follow-up on the expense side, looks like your add-in [indiscernible] expense was down for the quarter, does that mean that, it's been less than promotion and discounting? A - John Reyes We did spend less on promotional discounts, but on the expense side it's really television. If you recall, I think Q2, our TV spend accelerated and we commented that we didn't think the TV that we did was very effective and, so we did not spend any TV in Q3. So that's really the big swing and we increased our internet spend, so net-net in that numbers an increase in internet spend and a decrease in television. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. Just a kind of follow-up on that. On your second quarter call, you talked about I think you guys were experimenting a little bit with pulling back on the advertising and having some significant rate cuts across a number of your markets. So are you - given the more competitive environment I guess [indiscernible] would you pleased with the results that you saw in the third quarter and is that something you would continue to do in a going forward now? John Reyes : Well, in particular in one market, we ran a pretty aggressive price reduction in Q3 in terms of rate reduction versus last year and we were little disappointed that we did not get a corresponding change in moving volume to offset the change in price reduction. Overall that's not true but as John touched on earlier, there was not a lot of pricing power across the platform. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then could you just touch a little bit on what you have saw in the Hurricane impacted markets, I guess in parts of Florida and your properties in Houston in terms of increased occupancy or the ability to price up there, would you be more sensitive if customers that came in because of the Hurricane in terms of increasing your prices on the [indiscernible] maybe just some color around the strategy there. John Reyes : Sure with respect to Houston, where we saw the biggest impact, no we did not increase prices, we're very careful about that. So, no we did not. We did see over a 100% increase in moving volume across Houston, which is welcome, given the way Houston has been performing. So we had a nice uptick in moving volume. Florida, some markets up, some markets flat, but in all of our Florida markets in terms of revenue growth for the quarter, Miami was one of the worst in terms of revenue growth down - the rate of growth down 7.1% Tampa down 7% and West Palm down 5.7%. So, not as much benefit in the Florida markets as we go out in Houston. Operator : And your next question comes from Ryan Burke, with Green Street Advisor. Ryan Burke : Thanks Ron. Just continue with the Hurricane impact. I guess particularly in Houston given the benefit there, at some point in time that temporary fill from Hurricane related occupancy becomes a drag, is that 12 months out of that 24 months out, how long do these customers typically stay? John Reyes : Ryan, generally we see an uptick in activity for about 12 to 18 months and then to your point, it becomes a headwind. This activity normalizes and so then you're up against tough comps. So assuming these customers stay for the norm, I'll call it, if there is a normal Hurricane, certainly the Harvey in Houston was not a normal Hurricane, but assuming what we have historically seen, that will be there for 12 to 18 months, so that will give us a lift. The camps obviously will be easier going into 2018 in Houston than they there were in 2017 but this will certainly give it a slight up lift. Ryan Burke : Yeah, thanks. And I'm going back in time a bit here on, but back in 2005 when you were talking about Florida Hurricanes, on one or two earnings calls you didn't foresee much benefit. Your view at that time was that occupancy was already pretty high and that it remained high sort of during and after the Hurricanes that's toward to the end of that year, end of 2005 and I think NOI growth in those [indiscernible] properties was something like 20%, when the same-store was doing something like 7%, so that ended up being a real benefit. But besides the fact that occupancy there is a starting point of occupancy now as higher than it was backed than, what was different this time about Florida for your properties not to fill up as much as you might have thought? John Reyes : Well if you recall in 2005, we had three Hurricanes through Florida. So far, not come would, we have only had really one. Ryan Burke : Yes. Okay. John Reyes : Last time it really impacted, I recall our Orlando markets, and kind of Northern Miami for allotted till that area. So, we have more properties in Florida this time, but the severity in the fact that there was one versus three is I think the biggest difference versus 2005. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Ron hoping to get your latest thoughts on the supply landscape, which markets, sub-markets you operate in or seen the most impact? And is the pressure meaning, there is sort of the visible pipeline in the supplying new markets is that been increasing this year? Ron Havner : Again there is not good stats on what is supply, and we really focus on properties near us. I would say that, we've talked about Huston, pre-Hurricane, supply, Dallas has got supply. If you look at the markets that had meaningful degradation and occupancy Q3 2017 versus Q3 2016, sure that's down 1.8%, Miami is down 1.8%, Portland is down 1.6%, Chicago is down 1.6%, Dallas is down 1.6%, Atlanta is down 1.5%, Denver is down 1.3%. All of those markets we have seen a meaningful increase in supply in those markets. Did you take Portland, we've been told there is 30 properties, under consideration to be developed in that market which is a big uptick in supply, Denver, we have been saying quarter-after-quarter big uptick in supply, and we still see 30 or 40 more properties coming into that market. So, I'm hoping given the slowdown in renovates, in occupancy and renovates, and reduction in pricing power, that will create some kind of headwind for people to put developments on hold or simply abandoned doing them. Certainly, the tone is changed with respect to developing properties and getting 4%, 5% rate increases in revenue, quick fill-up and all that kind of stuff. I think it's going to be we'll have pretty meaningful uptick and supply this year. I don't know about next year, but even if we have a meaningful reduction, extra is going to be a couple years as each properties fill up. Nick Yulico : It's helpful. And then, I was hoping to get the move in versus move out rate delta which you usually provide in the Q and K. And also just to get a feel for that impact that's been an impact, I guess in last year move-in, move-out, delta changing. How is that playing out this year, and how at some point, when is the timing issue where, some of that negative impact perhaps eases? Thanks. John Reyes : This is John. It starting to ease a little bit now if you look at Q3 versus Q2. Where in Q3, people were moving in with average monthly rates of about $131 for this quarter, and they were moving out at about a $143. So, it's about $12 negative delta there. Last year, for the same quarter, it was a $135 move-in, a $143 move-out, it was about $8. So, we're down about for call it about $4. In the second quarter, we were down about $8 differential. So, it's narrowing, but it's still a negative. When will that turn positive or at least neutralize, it's difficult to say. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman, Sachs. Andrew Rosivach : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call. You are the first stores need to report so potentially others may have the similar trend in same-store. But if you look at least through 2Q your same-store revenues have been under a couple of competitors to be excited really now for years. So, I'm just wondering I don't know if you ever thought about it, through best practices or from competitive spirit, if you ever looked into why there has been the gap between you and the other large competitors? Ron Havner : Well there is two big reasons, one is difference in the way we report same-store versus the way they report same-store and two, market mix. Andrew Rosivach : Do you think their particular markets that are dragging you, you down versus the broader market? Ron Havner : Well if you and you can see this in the queue, you can see which markets have greater headwinds, I just touched on Florida, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Denver those are all markets they have pretty significant headwinds for us. I don't know the exact market mix EXR relative to us in those markets. I know cube is much greater concentrated in the North East and particular in New York. While there is anticipate a lot of new supply in New York, our occupancy in New York was only down 10 basis points year-over-year and our revenue growth the rate of revenue growth was only down 40 basis points year-over-year. So, in terms of way to change revenue growth, New York was the best in Q3 of all of our top markets. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Market. Jeremy Metz : Hey guys. Just want to go back to Houston, some of the Hurricane impact quickly and just think about the supply picture there. Just Ron, giving your experience through seeing the stuff, do you think that's what's going on down there actually squash out some of that supply or is it more likely to possibly just to lay it further down the road here? Ron Havner : You know Jeremy, I don't know because in terms of what guys are going to do it is certainly been an uptick in demand and the properties, I think we delivered four properties in Houston in Q3 and one of them we delivered mid-July and it's already 60% occupied. So, in terms of new development, our timing couldn't have been better for those deliveries in July. But depending on, so they get flooded, they have where they half way are they ground, and their property get water damage and all that, that may impact their decision to build or not to build. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Thanks, and John just one for you on the balance sheet, in terms of the bond offering the cash buildup we saw, you can more than fund your current pipeline with routine cash, so how should we think about redeployment from here. Is there anything in the pipeline, so we just kind of thinking about cash as there to be opportunistic of something does shake free? John Reyes : Well in terms of pipeline I think we have disclosed everything in the press release, of what our development pipeline is in our acquisition commitments are. Other than that we don't have anything else specifically here mark for that. There are some preferred set of callable, but we haven't made that decision whether to call them or redeem them yet. So we look for probably some opportunistic uses of the cash that we're currently sitting on. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Corak with FBR. David Corak : Hey, good morning out there. Not to harp on the Hurricane too much, but I just want to touch on a real quick. I realized that it might be difficult to exactly quantify how much benefit you got from Hurricane during 3Q, but do you have a sense is to what maybe overall same-store numbers would have been excluding the Hurricane, even if you can just say actual versus your budget? Ron Havner : Well I don't think it was a net benefit, in fact we wrote off a fair amount of rent, fees, late charges we held back rental rate increases to customers both in Houston and in Florida. So if you put all that together excluding the seven properties or eight properties that we shutdown, our revenue in September, basically Q3 was done about $1.5 million. David Corak : Okay. That's helpful. John Reyes : We really see the benefit of the moving, I don't think really until we get to Q4, assuming those customers stay. David Corak : Alright, make sense. Okay, and then turning to expenses, how do you think property taxes will trend next year versus this year, is kind of 4.5% level and then overall should we expect kind of normal levels or we had a pretty good run rate for expense growth in the quarter. John Reyes : You know, just talking to our property tax, before I walked into this room and I think we're still expecting for 2018 and it's still early but we are still expecting 4.5% to 5% increase, which is kind of what we have been experiencing over the past three years or so. So, we think that will be probably fairly consistent going into 2018. David Corak : Okay, thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBank Capital Market. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Ron your comments about a lack of pricing power, just curious you have been taking down rate and increasing discounting and promotions, what you attribute the decrease and movements to is there anything that you can point to on the software demand. Ronald Havner : Well, couple of quarters ago I touched on what I thought might be some macro-economic factors, I would just add to that you know the rate of both employment in kind of look in two ways, both the rate of growth and employment has slowed, while we are at low on employment, the needle is not really moving materially lower and most markets for the rate of change and employment hasn't really move very much and that to me would be an indicator of activity, you know as people get more jobs, they do more things once everyone once employee kind of their activity level has slowed, and then 2, the other big headwind is new development. I start saying in 2015, things are probably peaking, and developments will create headwinds for pricing power and we are here in 2017 and in fact developments are accelerated and it is creating the headwind for pricing power. Markets where we have not seen a material level of development such as LA, San Francisco, Seattle, but we have modest pricing power we don't have the headwinds that we have in markets where there is total amount of new supply. Charlotte, Denver, Huston Dallas the all the ones I named. Todd Thomas : Okay and then, in terms of acquisitions I guess you continue to chip away here but John your comments about being opportunistic with the cash on the balance sheet you know just curious if you could comment on that a little bit further? John Reyes : There is no much to comment on, I mean would be at about 400 to spend on our current development line with development pipeline over the next 12 months and taking quarter end and we had $30 million or $50 million of acquisition, we'll probably have a few more in the quarter. So, if you just take that cash right there, it's almost a $0.5 billion. Todd Thomas : Is there - what's your interest level like to expand in New York city and Manhattan today is that something that you would like to increase your exposure to, is that a market that you like to increase your exposure to, if you had the opportunity? John Reyes : We are open to every market, it really depends on the opportunity what's the price per pound of where the property, the competition ratio, the demographics, New York like any other market where we happy to grow into New York, if it was the right opportunity. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time, just curious, if the period end data points that you have previously pointed to being an indicator of kind of the next quarters performances, that was in anyway positively or negatively affected by the Hurricanes, I am not sure if those numbers were script from the properties that were taken out of the same-store pool. John Reyes : Yeah, if you look at the end of Q2, occupancy was down 70 basis points, in place rents were up 3.6%. So, you would have expected same-store revenue growth of 2.8%, 2.9%. I think we came in at closer to 2.6%, and most of that difference 2.6% to 2.9% is attributable to the right-off of rents and delays of fee renovate increases for the Hurricane impacted properties. Juan Sanabria : Okay. John Reyes : So, going into Q3, occupancy is down 110 basis points, and place rents are up 270 basis points. So, you're looking at a 1.6% increase in place heading into Q4. Juan Sanabria : That 1.6 is it necessarily being impacted by the Hurricane delays and rent increases or not, sorry? John Reyes : It is, the quarter having impact in Q4 from the delay of rental rate increases, I think about a $0.5 million. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then just a question on the demand side, are you seeing any kind of offsetting benefit particularly in some of the more urban areas from a pick-up in business demand, whether it relates to e-commerce or not? John Reyes : We haven't really looked at it, in that fashion. So, we couldn't really say. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Van Cart [ph] with EverCore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. I know, you gave us on occupancy delta sets earlier on, but can you talk about the revenue and NOI growth within your top market? John Reyes : This is John again. So, let me start with the revenue growth first. So, Los Angeles which is our by far a largest market, for the quarter was up 5.3%, San Francisco 3.6%, New York 2.6%, Chicago was down about 0.8%, Washington DC was up 0.9%, Miami was down 1%, Atlanta was up 1%, Seattle was up 4.2%, Huston was down 3.5% and Dallas was at, was a positive but it's only 0.2%. Those are a top ten markets in that with respect to revenue growth. On the NOI growth, Los Angeles was up 6.3%, San Francisco 4.3%, New York 2.3%, Chicago down 2.7%, Washington DC was down 0.1%, Miami down 3.1%, Atlanta up 5.1%, Seattle up 4.3%, Huston down 5.8% and Dallas was down 1.8%. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. I was just hoping to go into the LA and [indiscernible] trends there, they're decelerating to say what seems like, some of that new supply, can you talk about what you think might be going on there in terms of facing power? John Reyes : I think, Los Angeles for us is really the deceleration, is really a comp more of a year-over-year comp issue, it's not the market that we're seeing a lot of new supply. So I think, our - moving rates are probably flat to slightly up, and we've got pretty good moving volume, pretty good occupancy, Los Angeles given its size one of our best performing markets, that represents about 16% of our revenue, it's a good market for us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just really quickly, can you talk about street rent trends within the west coast markets and the taxes one. John Reyes : Well, I don't know the numbers of hand, I can just intuitively the west coast street rates are slightly up year-over-year, Texas down year-over-year. Unidentified Analyst : Do you know if the negative growth rate in Texas has improved it all, because of the Hurricane? John Reyes : Well, we're, as Ron mentioned, we were running the test when the markets and the market they had, people running that test happen to be in Houston, but then when the Hurricane hit, that kind of through a monkey ranch into a lot of things we were dealing, so the rents were kind of little wacky down there but none the less, they are not really up year-over-year, even if you account for the uplift in Japan and Houston. We really can't jack up our rents during the - I think you know it. Ron Havner : The natural disaster such as bad time, so we kept the rents in check. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, good morning guys. Going back to the acquisitions topic, what is your current appetite for larger portfolio deals given some of the slowdown we have seen in fundamental, do you think it's like the right time to buy and of course is a bit spread close to what you think is unrealistic. John Reyes : Is your question really like what is the acquisition environment? Or what are we invested in doing? Ki Bin Kim : Both. John Reyes : Well, the environment acquisition activity, velocity transactions, low demand strictly from last year. Couple of reasons, I think the bid desperate has widen and I think it continuous to wind as forward growth projections come down by buyers and the sellers continued to hope for 2016 pricing. So that's one. Two, in terms of what we will be willing to do, same answer I gave on New York, we are invested in one property or 100 properties, it simply depends on the quality of the assets, the price per foot, where the rents are what competition ratios, all those things that we evaluate on one property we do on 100 properties. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And you guys obviously tested unsecured debt markets, this time, this quarter. Given the favorable response just curious your appetite to do more of it and at any given moment, how much expansion capital, external growth capital do you think you can raise today including debt or preferred? Ron Havner : We have tremendous amount of capacity to raise capital either debt or preferred and whether we used debt or not, it really depends on what the opportunity today, how much money we need, use process and what's happening in other capital markets. So, up until September we have been tapping the preferred market, when rates are 490 to 510 in the preferred market will probably go to that side of the market versus the debt market. When you go to the debt market you need to raise $400 million to $500 million, so you need to pretty meaningful user proceeds. You have anything to ad John. Ki Bin Kim : I guess that question, how much do you think you can raise without or where you feel comfortable with the leverage ratio for the company? Ron Havner : A lot. Ki Bin Kim : Alright, thanks guys. Operator : And then the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions, just one follow up on the, these estimated same-store revenue the 1.6% you refer to, John, just sort of adding your comments or taking your comments for property taxes, I am assuming sort of a more normalized expense rate is sort of in the 2% to 3% range. Do you envision sort of then therefore using that math same-store NOI potentially trending down may be stabilizing somewhere some 1%? John Reyes : Well that doing your math that would certainly indicative, if revenues at 1.5% to 2% and expenses are at 1.5% to 2% or 2.5%, is the math as you have 1% to 2% NOI growth. One thing you need to keep in mind as we kind of rent roll down here and have all the occupancies but don't have much haven't had much pricing power of late, is that the comps will get easier and one of the things we've - you need to tie to express the people is that in 2017's coming of some really exceptional comps in 2016 and 2015. But certainly I touched on Houston earlier certainly the comps for Houston in 2018, will be much easier than they were here in 2017. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, and then just to follow up on a prior question, just tactically going into in Q4 and maybe 1Q are you considering any specific steps or strategies like you did with Houston the prior quarter any sort of test that you are planning to run you can share any color with us? Ron Havner : There's nothing in the works right now so, I think we'll just continue look our marketing wise we will continue to spend more probably on the internet. I think we did a television in the fourth quarter of last year, we probably will forgo that, that this year-end deferred those funds into the internet that other than that there is nothing, nothing really new deliver without we're going to be testing us at the moment. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Great thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Michael Mueller : Hi. First going through your comments about development when you look at your pipeline you have had about 500 to 600 plus million in process for some time for probably couple years at this point. As you look forward over the next year or so, do you expect any meaningful I guess shrinkage to that pipeline or do you think you are going to be at that same level? Ron Havner : Yes Mike. We ended last year at 660 million, but I think that was up 100 million and 150 million from the beginning of 2016, you are right, we have being running about 600 million, I see that continuing for probably the next 12 to 18 months at least. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. And going to NOI growth looking at the expense lines, it looks like you year-over-year expense growth was down meaningfully compared to prior quarters almost across the board, I know you touched on add spending but when you look at the summed-up quarter here does it feel little bit more like normally or a little bit more like normalize go forward level? Ron Havner : Well utilities were down 2.9% year-to-date they are down 1% it's so obviously been benefitting from lower oil prices that comps to get a little tougher next year now we move always depends on the weather. The big swings really are we're in the advertising year-to-date television is up for Q3 is down and as John just touched on we did Q4 television last year we probably won't do that this year although the internet spend will be up, but my guess is the advertising line will be down in Q4. The other items there is an item here and item there, but historically 2% to 3% is what I would expect in terms of the expense growth? Michael Mueller : Okay. That was it. Thank you. John Reyes : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Jefferies. And your next question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Hi guys. Just want a question in terms of the New York, it sounds like New York might have been a little bit better than expected any kind of comments can you give on trends in New York and how that's going relative to expectations and how you feel market is going forward? Ron Havner : Well New York has been bouncing around couple of percent revenue growth hasn't been strong, but it has been meaningfully weak. We have done some management changes in New York over the last year, year and half, as the team is doing well so, we have got a strong team operation in New York and I think they are executing. There is new supply in New York, I don't think from what I understand there is more on a way, so my anticipation is New York will be an increasingly challenging market for new supply, but it's been going okay in New York. Not really stronger as the West Coast markets but not the problems of the Texas market. George Hoglund : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's a Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Ron or John just thinking about the speed and the occupancy throughout the quarter, but as I think back to last year in the fourth quarter you effectively being most of the occupancy from where you started, so you started the quarter at 94.2% and the average 93.8% for the fourth quarter of last year. You are coming at the end as you said down 110 basis points at 93.2% I assume there is some rounding going on there. How should we expect that trend line and certainly how is it today relative to last year to know whether that spread compresses or whether it expands? Ron Havner : I think as I have - the few days ago that I looked at the occupancy spread, occupancy spread the negative spread has narrowed quite a bit, so that 1.1% negative spread that we had at the end of the quarter as of few days ago and there to about 50 basis points, so currently have. Michael Bilerman : And so when you throughout the math down 110 plus 270 have in place getting to 1.6% there is a possibility as the 50 basis points will also at same-store, revenue growth could be in access and certainly taking to account, Ron your comments that 60 [indiscernible] side deceleration from 15 which is a record occupancy year the tops for 2017 certainly look better from that respect? John Reyes : Yes, and you know Michael you can be assure that we are working every day to try to narrow the occupancy spread and drive revenue growth. Michael Bilerman : Well I guess the question; how aggressive you are going be on rate and discounts which would offset the gain in occupancy? Ron Havner : Yeah, I, Michael again we're not, we've said this before, we're not just occupancy driven I mean occupancy just one leg of revenue growth so we're trying to balance the occupancy as best we can with rates and discounting. Looking at lengthen stay, looking at rate increases to existing tenants and how sticky that still remains, I want to make sure we're not disrupting the Apple car because those tenants that have been here for more than a year very important and a significant part of our revenue growth during the past and going forward. So there is a lot of components in that I mean the thing I wanted to do is narrow occupancy that there I say it's kind of easy to do but it's not the best, may not be the best thing to maintain or the revenue growth we can get. Michael Bilerman : Right. But the same talk you said earlier and that one market your drop rate significantly it didn't drive with the moving volumes to what gets out? Ron Havner : I would say that's a special market I mean we've all been talking about Houston for a while now, but I would be worry about if I did something like that in San Francisco, Los Angeles there will be almost 99% occupied. Michael Bilerman : Line up the door. Can you elaborate little bit on the rate increases to existing tenants sort of what levels are those are going out at what's the takeaway on those in terms of acceptance versus negotiations just a little bit more color around the aspect up of the revenue stream? John Reyes : We continue to send out increases to the existing tenant base, I'll be at touched upon the two markets the Houston market as well as all of the Florida market where we deferred increases. We will probably not pick them back up until December so we're going to forgo those that benefit of increases, it will be a negative hit for us in the fourth quarter. Ron mentions about a 0.5 million drag irrespective with those two I would say markets the rest of the markets we're continuing to send them out just like normal [indiscernible] move out activity. The percentage monthly increased that have been that are being given our very consistent work last year. Michael Bilerman : Last question just on Europe. We want - just give an update as to where those stand today in terms of performance and overall sort of direction of how you see you're holding evolving there? Ron Havner : Sure Michael. Europe for the quarter same-store revenue growth was up 2.2%, NOI was up 1.3%, we had an uptick in expenses both in advertising and R&M during the quarter, so expenses were a bit above trend line at 3.7%, occupancy is 90.8, basically the same in year-over-year, last year was 91.1. And in place rents are up 2.3%, that's on the same-store pool, continue to benefit from the acquisitions, dealing up those in both Holland and Germany and couple we did in France. They're all filling up nicely. And in Europe we've been ramping up our development and so, we have about an $80 million development pipeline, it should be invested over the next 12 to 18 months, properties mainly in Germany and London. Michael Bilerman : Thank you. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria, with the Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. Just hoping you could talk about street rates and how that trended year-over-year throughout the third quarter and into the fourth? John Reyes : Yeah. I don't have that data - I mean, what I mentioned was what the moving rate was, because it's to me, that's a more important data point, and what people are actually taking and moving in, and it's additive to our revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, the take rate was down about 3%, during the quarter versus the same quarter of last year. I would suspect that our street rates were probably down about similar amounts. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then on the acquisition side, hoping you could talk to kind of what kind of cap rates, you would be comfortable underwriting on a stabilized basis for primary and secondary markets? John Reyes : I can give you general numbers, it really depends on the markets, the sub-markets, the quality of the asset, the competition ratio, demographics, a whole variety of factors. I think, what we've been saying is in general we're developing to 8% to 9% yields and acquisitions 6% to 7%. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I think, I heard this right earlier, but sounds like Chicago and Miami, saw an outsized expense growth in the quarter, and I'm guessing that was due to tax hikes, do you see this headwind continuing into 2018 or do you see coming down to maybe low single-digit increases? John Reyes : In tax rates or its overall expenses? Jonathan Hughes : Tax. John Reyes : I think you're right, to your point about taxes is driving that some of the expense growth in those markets it's probably true. Some of those markets have been early aggressive, will they continue to be aggressive into next year? Possible, we now it's kind of embedded when I said earlier that I felt like tax, probably tax increases are still going to be in the range of about 4.5% to 5%. I think, we're going to still see increases in [indiscernible] County in Chicago, as well as in the Florida market. The only maybe positive thing we might see is I think there's been some discussion in Huston about possibly lowering property tax assessments, given the damage caused by the Hurricane, but that remains to be same. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, thanks for that. And then just one more, you mentioned you'll be opportunistic with the usage your cash balance, I mean does that share buybacks and if so, what you look at when determining that as an option? Ron Havner : Well, I think we have ended the quarter was about $700 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have got about 400 to spend on our development pipeline and I think in quarter we had 50 million or 60 million of acquisitions under contract and we've got few other things. That there is not, more than kind of a couple of 100 million there that we can't point to and say here's the potential use. As I've said on previous calls, share buybacks always wanted the menu items in terms of allocating capital, whether we do developments, redevelopments, acquisitions, retired debt or share repurchases depends on what is the opportunities there, what do we think the rates of return are going to be, and then our, and of overall financial liquidity. So, we've been authorized share repurchase program and that is one of the menu new items in terms of allocating capital. Jonathan Hughes : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Q&A portion for today's call. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clem Teng, for any final statement. Clem Teng : Thank you for your attendance this afternoon and we'll talk to you for our year-end earnings in sometime in February. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

We had a good quarter, good Q4 and a good 2017. So operator, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Yes hi, just couple of questions on rate increases, we're heading into the period of time over the next few months where you're going to start heading up the rate increases to existing clients. So, I'm wondering can you give us color in terms of what you are thinking off in terms of increases this year versus last year and just any other commentary around that? John Reyes : Yes Mike, this is John. I think what we'll be doing at the, what the game plan right now is we're going to continue to send out increases similar to how we've done over the past couple of years. The increases will probably be in the range of 8% to 10% will target our longer term tenants that generally have been here longer than a year that's very similar to what we've done in the past. And what we've noticed so far is that the long-term tenant continues to accept the rate increases and so far they are still very sticky. We haven't seen any determent over the past year in terms of their stickiness as we continue to push, the 8% to 10% increases. So, we're going to continue to do that in still such time we soon, some pushback by means of them vacating more rapidly. But, we haven't seen that yet. Michael Mueller : Got it. And for follow-up, in terms of you gave us the spot January 31, occupancy rate. I was wondering, can you tell us what you've seen so far to September, I mean into February? John Reyes : Well we gave you the year-end occupancy spot rate at 91.2% which was down about 1.4%. I will tell you that year-to-date our average occupancy spread is down about 80 basis points. So, it's better, it's inside of the 1.4% that we reported at, right at the end of the year. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay, thank you. John Reyes : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Simone of Evercore ISI. Robert Simone : Hey guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. Just a quick question on Q4 just trying to dig into that a 140 basis drop a little bit, its way more than anything you guys have experienced in recent years. So, I was wondering if you could just comment a little on how much of that is pure occupancy drop and how much could be attributed maybe to you guys more aggressively revenue managing? John Reyes : You know what we've, and again this is John. What we've been seeing is that our occupancy has been dropping more rapidly towards the end of the month. So that, the month end periods that we reported on Tuesday at the year-end number, the 140 basis points drop is somewhat misleading and that's why when Mike Mueller asked the question, I gave him the average occupancy. So, I think as we move forward we will probably change that metric that disclosure to try to provide a more average occupancy as of, as supposed to reporting a single day in the month. So, I think it's a little misleading and it's different than what you've seen in the past and we have seen more of our tenants vacate towards the end of the month now as oppose to kind of little more spread out through the month. And so to little misleading now, I think for folks when they just kind of look at that and then think about revenue growth for the next quarter. Hence again that's why I gave you the average occupancy that we're seeing year-to-date at being down 80 basis points as oppose to the 140 basis points. Robert Simone : Okay, great. Yes. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up obviously the big announcement last night, one portion of that release caught a lot of people by surprise and that was the internal promotion to really promote the third-party managed business. So, I guess just it's, new for a lot of investors that would follow PSA for a while, so could you just kind of talk broadly around the strategic plan there? Ron Havner : Yes. We've actually been doing third-party management for 40 years. Not promoting it and to what I think we got 30, 35 properties. So, we think actually we know how to do it, but it's really, the other guys have been doing it a while, they've established that is a business, I didn't really think it would ever take off as a business, but it seems to taken off. And so, we're going to kind of wait in here. Our business approach to at those going to be a little different, I don't think it's going to be a big profit generator for us, because we plan to pass through most of the benefits to the operators for which we'll be providing the service. So, I like and it's a kind of an Amazon strategy, where in, we're going to pass the - most of the benefits from the tenant insurance and the benefits of operating our platform on to the owners for which we provide the service. Robert Simone : Okay. Okay, great. And just that one last question from me on that last point, like what been is the - the ideal or the intended benefit to you guys, just to create an acquisition pipeline long-term or what's kind of the thinking there? Ron Havner : I'm sure there would be some acquisition benefits associated to it, some scale benefits in terms of our platform. Some marketing benefits, similar benefits to what the other guys are achieving other than again we're going to pass most of the profits on to the owners. Robert Simone : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. Just with regards to same-store revenues. How are you guys thinking about how that moves going forward, are we approaching a trough any times of kind of stabilization from kind of current levels, it looks like you are rent per occupied square foot actually the delta of this quarter versus last year and if I compare that with our third quarter 2017 numbers actually improved. So, if you could just give us a sense of kind of where you think we are in the cycle and approximately to the trough maybe? John Reyes : Well certainly we're later in the cycle, 2011 to 2015, 2016 we had above average trend, above trend line growth rates that is slowed down with the pick-up in new supply. The other two public companies that have reported have indicated in their guidance that they are going to have positive revenue growth that's our anticipation in 2018. I think Q4 results for most people were better than the street expected. So, overall we're at the bottom, I don't know if we're at the bottom, I expect delivery this year to be comparable to last year to $3.5 billion to $4 billion. So, we still got headwinds in terms of new supply. But, the business is really incredibly resilient, when you think back in 2013 there were about $500 million of deliveries and here in 2017 the best guess is about $3.5 billion. So, you've had a 7 fold increase in new supply in a period of four years and yet at least from the public companies reporting all reporting positive same-store growth. So, I think the testament to the resilience of the business as well as the pent up demand for the product. Juan Sanabria : And just a follow-up from me, you guys split some occupancy throughout 2017, do you expect that to continue into 2018 or as a result I guess the new supply and kind of what are your latest thoughts, later to that on using concessions at this point, you kind of sound a little bit more skeptical in the second half last year that it wasn't getting the results you needed and how should we think about going forward? John Reyes : Certainly, we'd like to see the occupancy gap closed as much as possible and we're working towards that goal. We also mentioned that we weren't happy with our television marketing efforts and we're going to spend more time or more money and time with paid search and we started to do that and I expect this to continue to do that as we move forward. We're trying to hold the line on discounts and rates, as best we can. So, I don't know what the occupancy gap increases or decreases, but certainly we're working on trying to balance that with continued revenue growth, so get us not just about occupancy, although we think it's a big part of that obviously, but there is other factors that come into play off. So, we're really focused on the revenue growth and trying to maintain positive revenue growth throughout the year. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies. George Hoglund : Hi guys, I just wonder if you give your outlook on the acquisition and environment and what you are seeing from developers who have recently developed product if they are looking to exit early? Ron Havner : We've, George we've actually seen an up tick in that both reverse enquires from people that have sites or thinking about sites calling us wondering if we wanted to purchase them, take over their entitlements. There is a couple of portfolios on the market that are recently developed properties that are, at least the indications are selling on a pro forma basis, which to me indicates a little bit of skittishness in terms of develop, local developers in terms of their market outlook. So, we're seeing more of that kind of product, in terms of stabilized properties not a lot to-date, its early first quarter. So, normally there is not a lot of product at this time of the year, but not a lot of the more stabilized properties. There is a gap between private and public markets, the private markets are pricing ahead of what the public companies are trading for. Couple of years ago, there was an arbitrage guys could sell stock and buy properties in the private marketplace that's flipped and the private market values there was a lot of capital chasing stuff and it's ahead of the public market. George Hoglund : Okay, and then give that those developers are kind of looking to exit earlier and getting little bit more nervous, do you think that and translates to new development start slowing? Ron Havner : Well, you got to understand in terms of developments under the economics. So, for us we're building an anticipated 8% to 9% stabilized deals. And on our earlier developments, we've exceeded that. And if you are able to market that portfolio, we're not in the business of building them and selling them, but if we were to market that portfolio as I indicated earlier it probably trade somewhere in the 5%, 5 cap rate zip code. So, that in terms of development that's a 60% to 80% margin on what we're doing. And so, even if you are a local guy and you're only getting 30% or 40% margin meaning, you build it for a $1 and sell it for $1.30 you're going to keep developing, really to one or two things happens, either A), you can achieve the yield or the monetization rate, the 5 goes to a 6 or 7 and so there is basically no spread. But, the economics of development have made a lot of sense and that's why you've seen a big up tick in new supply. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi thanks, good afternoon. Just Ron, first question just stalling up your comments about the third-party management platform that it won't be a big profit generator. So, you're going to pass along the tenant insurance revenue to the owner. Can you just describe the price structure, a bit more will you be charging, management fees as a percent of revenue or is it going to be some sort of fixed cost or something else? Ron Havner : Yes Todd, it will be a percentage of revenue, it's going to be very competitive. The expense pass through is going to be competitive and the tenant insurance participation is going to be very competitive. And in fact from what I know is most of the others are not passing much of the tenant insurance through and we're going to pass a fair amount of it through. Todd Thomas : Okay, and is do you have sort of a pipeline in place of, third-party management contracts today is it something that you've started working on already and how big of an opportunity do you think that there is? Ron Havner : Well we made the management changes here recently putting a long time veteran here Pete Panos, in charge of the third-party program and I think you'll see in the coming months Pete rolling out our program and he is actually out today, soliciting some business. So, how big is the opportunity, well as I said earlier, I think the, certainly Cube and Extra Space have demonstrated that it's a business much bigger than I ever thought it would and so the size the opportunity is probably quite significant. Todd Thomas : Okay that's helpful. And then just lastly, Ron it was just a couple of quarters ago, I think late last summer actually where, you talked about a lack of pricing power or weaker, consumer and some consumer credit metrics, the tone on this call and your comments about the resiliency of the business and the pent up demand for the product, the teams, a bit different, and I'm just trying to understand whether there has been a change to your market outlook, whether you're seeing an improvement in demand or weather conditions are firming up across the portfolio if that sort of the right read? Ron Havner : Well I think a year ago, right we didn't have a big tax law change, the stock market was about 20% lower, unemployment was good, but still not at the 4.0%, 4.1% and animal spreads were a little less. So, I think there has been an overall change in the tone of the economy, how long it last I don't know. But I think there has been a bit of a change in tone, certainly last year we were suffering pretty mildly in Houston with the decline oil, oils almost doubled year-over-year and the Houston market is actually up year-over-year in terms of occupancy. So, a number of things have changed. Todd Thomas : Okay, thank you. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. One of your peers just commented that on the West Coast San Francisco seems to be accelerating and they've sort of baked that into their guidance. Wondering if you could compare what you are seeing between San Francisco and LA and whether you are seeing some acceleration? Ron Havner : Well I'll start and John can add. San Francisco and this will be in the 10-K. San Francisco square foot occupancy year-end was 95.4% versus 96% last year and for the year it was flat 96% versus 96%, which is basically you are full at 96. LA was 95.7% versus 96% and for the year LA went up 96% versus 95.6%. Our revenue growth both in Q4 LA was 5.9%, San Francisco 4.7% and for the year LA was 7.2%, San Francisco 6.9%. So they are somewhat neck and neck. Vikram Malhotra : And do you expect to see sort of acceleration into 2018? Ron Havner : Well when your 96% occupied is not much to accelerate we may be a little more aggressive in the bay area depending on how we see demand flow with possibly rental rate increases and street pricing and reduced promotional discounts. But San Francisco and LA both been robust markets for last couple of years. John do you have anything to add on that? John Reyes : No, they are great markets; both markets are great for us. The whole lot cost it's been very good for us. Vikram Malhotra : Okay and then just one more if I may, your CapEx spend seem to pickup this year relative to the last two or three years. Just wondering if, this is sort of a good run rate to you, are there any specific redevelopment projects that you are envisioning in any specific market? Ron Havner : Well redevelopment that adds square footage does not go into maintenance CapEx it goes into the development numbers and redevelopment properties. Yes, well we've chased a couple of things in the CapEx arena; one, we're on a, we've moved to a quarterly process and budget versus an annual. So that's accelerated spend meaning, we're getting more of our CapEx done faster. Two, we had the hurricanes last year which, caused a few million bucks. Three, we've had some big projects in terms of LED lighting going on, some age back upgrades, you may cost written that not as a maintenance, because they are upgrades the lighting works, we just changed it out, but so we've got some upgrading in terms of equipment and features of the properties that we haven't had in prior years. What the run rate is this year, I'm sure will be somewhere $90 million to $100 million would be my guess at this time. But, it's going to change. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Corak of B. Riley FBR. David Corak : Good morning out there, John just on the quarter ending occupancy commentary, why do you think more customers are vacating at quarter end than kind of you are seeing historically? John Reyes : I think one of the things that we've done internally is, we've somewhat encouraged them to, if they are going to vacate at the beginning of the month at the end of previous month, which helps us kind of factor the space quicker and so we've done some things internally to encourage that and so that's what accelerated, I think some of the vacate activity at the end of the month. And we started that pipe mid-summer timeframe. David Corak : Okay and I apologize if I missed it, but what are your take rates year-to-date? John Reyes : Year-to-date 2018 or the fourth quarter? David Corak : Both together. John Reyes : Okay, I'll give it to you on a monthly basis, so let's start with the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter the average take rate monthly take rate was a $121.85 versus the same quarter last year at a $122.64. So it's down about 60 basis points. Year-to-date 2018, the average take rates are $121.52 versus the $122.31 sort of down again about 60 basis points. David Corak : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey John, just sticking with that, can you talk about how discounts trend in the quarter relative to last year and similarly so far this year? John Reyes : Yes I can, so discounting was last this year. So, we gave away close to $19 million this year the fourth quarter of 2017 versus about $20.8 million the same quarter last year. They are down a roughly about 8% on discounting. Jeremy Metz : And then on an effective discount to new customers is it down as well? John Reyes : Well the number of tenants, the percentage of tenants are getting discounts was actually, was up about 1.4%, so about 78% of our tenants were getting a discount versus last year at about 76%, 77%. Jeremy Metz : Okay, I appreciate that. And in terms of your advertising cost, you guys you were testing on TV earlier this year, John you had mentioned increasing paid search, but overall the spend was down again in the fourth quarter. So, you're finding that these leverage just starting to make as much of a difference in when you ramp them up or down and is it really just coming down the cutting rates that driving the most traffic? John Reyes : No we didn't spend any money on television this year, last year for the fourth quarter we spent plenty in television, we talked about that in the last quarter that, the television is still effective it's not as effective as it once was. So, we were going to spend more of our dollars or advertising dollars on paid search which we did during the fourth quarter. And we, and I expect that we will continue to do that and probably not due to little to no TV as we move into 2018 and just spend our dollars on the internet on paid search, which we find more effective in paid search not only on, folks using their desktop, the mobile devices as you know as everyone has become much more important for our consumer and by most consumers device of preference that they are using. So, we're definitely focused on lot more time, energy and money in those venues. Ron Havner : Jeremy to put some numbers on that, so Q1 2017 was been about $3.5 million on the internet and nearly $2 million on television in the first quarter of last year. This year we're not going to spend any million on television, but our internet spend is going to go up to around $5 million. Now on internet spending that depends on, whole bunch of bidding on keywords, markets a whole variety of things, but that's kind of our current estimate. So, we're swapping as John just swapping the television for the internet, absolute level in 2018, my guess this will be comparable to what we spent in 2017. Jeremy Metz : I appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks and good morning. So, few things seemed different than what we've been used to from PSA. One, you guys already talked about, little bit about the third-party management initiatives, your payroll; your property level increased which is unusual for you guys and then your CapEx increase. So, just curious if you can add more color behind those things and then of course the management changes and congrats on that. So, any more reasons behind all these changes and is there at all maybe some acknowledgment that you have to invest more in your properties or people to achieve better results? Ron Havner : Well Ki, no there is, we don't have to invest more in our properties to achieve better results, I think our results are quite good. I mean I just went through San Francisco and LA occupancies for the year 96% and those are some of our older more mature, very mature properties. But they are in phenomenal locations and of course they have the brand. With respect to property payroll, if you haven't seen there is a number of markets where we operate where there has been significant increases in the minimum wages due to statutory changes. And so that's made, we've been mandated to increase the wages in those markets. And as you can imagine there is some spill on effect, so if you are, if you have properties in an adjacent market, even though that market may not, that city may not have mandated an increase, you're going to have spillover effects in terms of retaining employees in that that adjacent market, because of the increases in wages. So it's just not the markets explicitly, where there is a minimum wage increase. And then third, in that line is medical insurance and that's also increased. Ki Bin Kim : And maybe can you talk about the timing of the, your retirement and John's and, you know the timing of making a change and succession plans? Ron Havner : Timing in terms of what? Ki Bin Kim : Timing, not the timing on the exact date, but, why is it, why is this the time to announce those things? Ron Havner : Well Ki, we've actually been working on this since 2014. We identified Joe and Joe raised his hand some time in 2015. So, we had to affect our succession plan and pierce business parts first to free up Joe and that resulted in the promotion of Maria Hawthorne to be the CEO of PS Business Parks and she is a great CEO and she is doing a great job there. She has been with us for 30 plus years. So, she knows the business. But, once we got Maria in place and then Joe was freed up to come here and start learning the self-storage business. And keep in mind, I've worked with Joe for 16 years, he knows the culture here, he is a great leader. So, really we've been just giving him time to get up to speed on the business and he and Tom are doing that and we think by the end of the year they will be ready or more than ready. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you and best wishes. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hello, thank you. I wanted to circle back on your getting more active in the third-party management business, that's it's a pretty profitable business and as you've indicated its certainly there is a fair amount of demand for given that, PSA as such a brand premium and the space, I'm just wondering why is it the right decision to go into this, it sounds like sort of from a neutral basis to earnings versus the things like could even charge more relative to peers given what a dominant position you have in the industry? Ron Havner : Well Smedes maybe once when we dominated then we'll change our pricing. But, we're getting started and we want to be very, very competitive and like I said, I liking it to the Amazon strategy, we want to take share we want to be very competitive and if we make modest profit for the first couple of years that's fine. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Ron Havner : Yet, but I do appreciate your comment that we do have a dominant brand, because yes we do have the dominant brand. We have the only brand by the way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi. Thanks. And just going back the move you guys are making at the management level. It is a cleaner for both of you to leave at the same time. We just wanted to hear a little more color maybe even from John. John Reyes : Is it cleaner for us? You know Ron and I talked about that a lot. And I guess the way I look at it is, is that I believe that we still both be active trustees in Public Storage. Ron and I invested most of our lives here. And we are basically wedded to this company. So although we're retiring and I still view as this still being somewhat actively involved consulting with Joe and Tom and the rest of the team here. And even though we are retiring, we're not really going anywhere per se just not coming into the office every day. So I don't see a whole lot changing. In fact, it's actually an upgrade Joe and Tom will be an upgrade from John and Ron but it's a good thing. Ron Havner : I will just add Todd. John's been the CFO here 22 years; I've been the CEO going on 16. And we're both nearly, well, I'm 32 and John's 28 year company veterans as John said we've been here most of our working lives and we're still committed and we're going to be -- John said active trustees we both own a lot of stock -- our big chunk of our net worth tied up in the company so we have a very strong vested interest in Joe and Tom's success. Todd Stender : Great. Thanks for the color fellows. And just lastly maybe sticking back to you John. Did you do a line of credit balance at the end of Q4 and maybe what's your capital sourcing thoughts are over the near term. It's always preferred but now you guys also have an appetite for the unsecured debt market. John Reyes : Well, we certainly can tap into the unsecured market. We've already done that and we've demonstrated Public Storage's ability to raise capital in that manner. We still like the preferred market although we may not like the current coupons are not as nice as they were a couple of months, years ago. But nonetheless, they -- we're still interested in the preferred market. We'll retain -- we'll continue to retain cash within the company, we'll probably retain $200 million to $250 million a year. We're sitting at the end of the year; we were sitting on about $433 million of cash. So we have plenty of liquidity. And so I'm not -- we're not too worried about our liquidity position. We have strong coverage ratios so we have the ability to continue to raise capital if need be. Our needs right now are really funding our development pipeline, our redevelopment pipeline which for the most part are retained cash flow and the existing cash that we have on hand can do that. So we have no real stress on the company to have to raise capital at least within the next six to nine months. Todd Stender : Thank you. John Reyes : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Michael Rierbrock : Good morning out there. Ron I was wondering if you can comment a little bit on the Board -- the anticipated Board changes. So I think right now your Board is 9. Sounds like John and Joe are going to come onto the Board. So that would be 11. Of those 11 between the three of you and then Wayne and Tamera that's 5 insiders and there was some comments in the release that you would look to add more independents but can you sort of go through the timing of that the anticipated size of the Board. I know for the size of your company keeping a Board at nine members has been relatively small, so I don't know if that's going to change. Just give a little bit of color on that. Ron Havner : Is this Smedes or Michael? Michael Rierbrock : It's Michael. Ron Havner : Yes. Okay, Michael. Yes. It is noted by our lead director in the press release, we'll be adding some independent directors during the course of this year. John and Joe are not going to join the Board until January 1 of next year. So the board's got 10 months to go find a couple of more directors and which we expect to have in place obviously by the fourth quarter. In terms of Board size, yes, with John and Joe coming on and myself being an insider and Hughes, we will have to enlarge the size of the Board to balance out independent versus insider directors. Michael Rierbrock : And so you anticipate that you're going to be going up to like a 13 type member Board? Ron Havner : Yes. Somewhere along that line and it may even get a little bigger because a couple of years down the road here we're going to have some director retirements though. Michael Rierbrock : Right. I don't know maybe I can have a question -- couple of guys on from the mid to late 90s still on the board. Ron Havner : Yes. So that would be moving million on in the next couple of years. Michael Rierbrock : How do you -- one of the things about the third party business that I think you've been critical of is that you have felt that it has stimulated a lot of development because a lot of mom and pops that haven't been able or developers that just can't get access to something all of a sudden can walk into a bank and say hey look I got an extra space managing my facility. Hey look I got cube managing my facility and all of a sudden they're able to get their loan and go build. And we thought it's been a big detractor and one of the reasons potentially for increased supply during this most recent wave. How do you sort of foresee yourselves playing in that? I mean do you -- will you do development sort of third party deals and that will contribute to this overall supply or do you view this business really as trying to take away managed assets from your peers or just growing it just by taking existing mom and pops? Ron Havner : Well, I think you answered your own question. It's all three. We're going to hopefully take share away from our competitors. Yes. We will do some developments. Yes, we'll do some established facilities. We want to grow the business. I think I have commented as you noted that I think has contributed to development because to a certain extent it takes away the operational risk but I also think the economics of the development which I went through earlier you build for a dollar and you can monetize it for a $1.50 or $1.60 or more determinative of whether someone is going to build rather than whether Public Storage or Extra Space or Cube are going to operate the property. At the end of the day it's about the economics of building and selling versus just getting someone to operate it. Michael Rierbrock : And then as you think maybe a couple of years down the road would you envision the potential for two companies Public Storage, the manager, the brand and a storage retailer that just owns the asset especially in light of tax reform that makes [Sea Corp] [ph] that much more profitable. Is that part of this thinking of going down the road that there's something bigger at play here? Ron Havner : No, not at this time. Michael Rierbrock : Not at this time\u2026 Ron Havner : You had [indiscernible] with Michael. I mean today we're managing 30 properties. You're getting way ahead of -- we're not that smart. Okay. So you're way ahead down the road in terms of saying, okay, this is part of a eight year plan and we're going to have 3000 properties under management. No. We've got to get going, we've got to get out of the blocks here and get some business. Michael Rierbrock : Yes. I just started about taking your existing properties and rolling that into a management platform and leaving the REIT that owns the real estate aside. Ron Havner : What we call, we had that structure up until 1995. And yes, tax reform is made Sea Corp better in terms of tax rates 20% or 21% than 35%. But 20% leakage is a lot more than 0% leakage and we can put a third party business into a TRS it fits at today's size level and our business volume level. And so we prefer to have no leakage versus a 20% leakage. Michael Rierbrock : Great. I appreciate the time. Ron Havner : Thanks Michael. Michael Rierbrock : Congratulations. Ron Havner : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call to Clem Teng for additional or closing remarks. Clem Teng : Thank you for attending our conference today and we'll talk to you next quarter. Bye now. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Public Storage Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Joe Russell : Great. Thank you, Ryan and good morning, everybody and thank you for joining us. We had a good quarter and I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Thanks for the time. Just curious on how you see the forward trajectory of same-store revenue growth? What the kind of latest speed is on the spring leasing season? I know it's still early, but are you seeing any changes in your ability to price new tenants or is it still a heavy concessionary environment? Tom Boyle : Thanks Juan. This is Tom Boyle. In looking at performance on move-ins in the first quarter, what we saw I'm sure we'll get the question on street rates, street rates were down in the quarter. Take rates, which we view as more meaningful of those that actually ramp with us were also down for the quarter and move in, that move in environment remains challenging. So while revenue deceleration has slowed as you can see in the report, we continue to have a tougher time on move ins. The flipside is our existing tenant base remained stable and we're entering a period now where we're going to send out more existing tenant rate increases and that will be a nice component of revenue growth for the year. So we continue to see move-in challenges, but a stable existing tenant base. Joe Russell : And on top of that a reduction in move-outs as well that came through in the first quarter. Tom Boyle : That's right. Juan Sanabria : Could you just put some numbers around the take rates and effective pay rates and any incremental details you can provide on rent bumps to existing kind of what you're going from into and-or if it's more often or quicker in sort of the length of lease up or that you\u2019ve previously done. Tom Boyle : Sure. The take rates were down about 4% in the quarter. As Joe mentioned, move-outs were down about 3%. Move-ins were down about 2%. So there is the net gain in occupancy differential that we saw in the quarter. In terms of promotions, a pretty consistent promotion strategy through the quarter. In terms of our existing tenant rate plan, nothing changed there from prior years. So we'll plan to continue to send those out. As I mentioned the months of May, June and July that we're entering into are some of our larger months for existing tenant rate increases and our tenant base has been stable. So all systems are go from that standpoint. Joe Russell : Yeah and again on that note Juan, as Tom mentioned we're really seeing little change in tenant behavior, which is very encouraging to us. So that's been consistent now for the last several quarters and it continues to be a vibrant part of the way that we're able to manage revenue. Juan Sanabria : And then I was hoping, this is my last question if you can give us any sense of spot trends, you can of apply to last quarter that the period end numbers weren\u2019t necessarily indicative of what you expected the fourth quarter to do. Any color you can provide on the period end trends and if those are good read through the expectations for the second quarter or the spot numbers will give you a different viewpoint? Joe Russell : Yeah I guess what I would say is that the period end numbers are one indicator and they're certainly a spot indicator and what you've seen over prior quarters is that some of the maybe historical relationship there has not held closely. I am not sure that it ever was really close in the past either, but indicators there if you look at period end occupancy and contract rent, contract rent up 2.7% in the quarter, period end occupancy down 1.2%, would obviously point to 1.5% if you want to do that math. Using period average occupancy of negative 0.9%, that gets you to 1.8%. So there is obviously a range there and we'll see what plays out. The spring quarter is obviously a meaningful quarter for move-in and move-in trends. So we'll need to monitor that as we go through the quarter. Juan Sanabria : Okay. So we shouldn\u2019t read into period end being lower than the average versus kind of the historical first quarter numbers as down as a negative data point or\u2026 Joe Russell : Those indicators I clearly walked through. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi. Good morning. Just first question looking at the occupancy at the end of the quarter versus the occupancy during the quarter's average, historically since 2005 when the company first began publishing same-store data, the ending occupancy in the first quarter has always been higher than the average occupancy in the quarter. Just from a seasonal standpoint, this was the first time I think it ever was lower on an absolute basis I'm just curious if you can comment on that and maybe you can share where occupancy is through this point in April? Joe Russell : Sure. So I think John described a little bit of what we're seeing in move-out trends that are impacting occupancy on the last call. We are seeing modestly more move-outs at the end of every month than what we've seen in prior years and so what that's doing is period end occupancy numbers are lower than what they are through the rest of the month, that's what driving the differential between weighted average and period end. Todd Thomas : Okay. So yes in terms of those comments, I guess about that month end decrease that you've been experiencing, can you just comment on that and maybe describe a little bit about what's happening there and what you're doing to sort of encourage that type of month end move out activity? Joe Russell : Yeah, well I guess I would just say we're seeing customer trends move out more at the end of the month. We view that actually as a positive as we look at when we get our inventory back to release getting our inventory back at the end of the month before you see month end and then beginning of month move-in activity is a positive. Todd Thomas : Okay. Are you able to share where occupancy is today for the same store and what that is on a year-over-year basis? Joe Russell : No. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then just lastly I just had a question on construction cost, you guys are obviously in the market with -- you have a fairly sizable pipeline and processing, you\u2019ve committed to maintaining few $100 million per year or so for the next years. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in construction cost increases for materials and labor and is that having an impact on you know you're expected returns and if so, how are you mitigating those rising costs?? Tom Boyle : Yeah Todd, not anything I can point to specifically relative to any meaningful inflation. We talked about it from quarter-to-quarter where in certain markets from time to time, you might have acceleration whether it's tied to labor or certain material costs like steel etcetera. but at the moment we're not seeing any meaningful change in construction cost. So again we've got an active development pipeline. As you mentioned we're developing product in multiple markets and we're really not seeing any meaningful inflation at the moment. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi thanks. I wanted to ask on the cost side as well, the on-site property manager versus a supervisory payroll costs were going in different directions. Is there anything specifically between the quarter or could you maybe just talk about those trends over the course of the year and why they were kind of in opposite directions? Joe Russell : Yes Smedes, we've had the opportunity to continue to optimize our field leadership across the system. So with that, we've had the opportunity to again look for economies of scale and optimizing cost structure on that front. At the property level we continue to see multitude of pressure that's tied not only to basically the impact from minimum wage increases market to market in some cases even city to city within markets, but there's growing pressure there that we continue to react to and does create headwinds relative to overall pay levels at the property level. But we've got a strong D team out in our leadership ranks that again we're pleased by their ability to run properties efficiency. We're continuing to look at any and all ways to magnify their own oversight, as we continue to actually even put additional properties in certain districts, whether it's through development or acquisitions, we continue find again good opportunities for economies of scale. So we're going to use out as frequently as we can, but overall it's a tough job environment. Unemployment as a whole is very low and we're out there competing for talent. So pleased again now by the level of commitment and lower turnover levels particularly in our management ranks and then again we're definitely seeing more pressure on property level employee wage and then to some degree turnover. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then I know it's only been a couple of months since you at publicly announced your entrance into the third-party management platform, but maybe you could just talk about some of the initial reaction thus far and kind of where you are on launching that initiative. Joe Russell : Sure. So yeah we're obviously just no more than a couple months into our formal entrance into the business, but we've definitely been very pleased by the reaction that we've gotten. We're in the early stages of rolling out not only our marketing plans, level contracts, materials, website etcetera, but we've been seeing a higher than we initially expected level of reverse inquiries. Lots of discussions from a variety of different type of operators whether those that are actually delivering new product to market and/or those that have existing properties that are looking for a different type of third-party management. So overall I'd tell you that we've been pleased by the fact that there's no question we have a commanding brand if you could even take that to another level, the only brand in the industry. So it's a strong draw. We've got good market knowledge, history and operating scale market to market. So the offering as a whole is getting very good reception. Now again were early into it and it's likely to take some amount of time to see the actual transition to owners that are going to come into our third-party management program, but again early indications are rough to very good start. Smedes Rose : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Is there any kind of visible relationships where properties have seen decreases in take rates? Is it just simple as more supply or are there other dynamics at play? Tom Boyle : They're certainly driven by the market environment around the individual properties. We operate a very local business where the customers of each individual property are around the three and five mile radius of that property. So it is pretty distinct. In terms of market trends, there is no question that some of our market are performing better than others and one of the drivers of the market that are performing less well is certainly new supply as we're competing for move-ins with new product that's opening and those new properties take their three years or so of lease up before they're stabilized. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just quickly, did you mentioned the take rate for month of April? Tom Boyle : I did not. Ki Bin Kim : All right. Do you mind providing that? Tom Boyle : No. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. So I guess my second question is really, your same-store revenue seems to have bottomed out. I know it's only one quarter and it can move around and you said a couple of interesting things. The take rate is about 4.5%. It sounds like you're still sticking with the same program in terms of existing customer rate increases. Your same store revenues looks like it's bottomed. So if I try to put everything together, does this mean even though take are down a little bit, but does this still mean that same store revenue shouldn\u2019t be much lower than this kind of 1% to 2% range? Tom Boyle : Obviously as we look forward, lots of things will impact same-store revenue growth as we go through the year. As we look at rent roll down, I'll give you a little bit more information around what rent roll down in the quarter was versus prior quarters. So take rates for the quarter were $119 per unit. That compared to $124 per unit in the first quarter of 2017. Move out rate in the first quarter of 2018 was a little over $137 and the move out rate in 2017 in the first quarter was $136. So we've seen a gap between move-in rate and move out rate in the first quarter of around $18 that has deteriorated from last year's first quarter, but if you compare that to the fourth quarter of 2017, it's actually a modest sequential improvement, the fourth quarter of 2017 for context was around $19. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. Could you maybe give us the same-store revenue growth across maybe your top five markets for the quarter? Joe Russell : Sure. So looking at our top five markets, Los Angeles had same-store revenue growth of 4.5%, San Francisco had 3.4% revenue growth, New York 2.9%, Chicago negative 2.3% and Washington DC negative 0.1%. Vikram Malhotra : Okay Thanks and just sort of maybe stepping back obviously supply has continued to be a big topic, was last year as well. What sort of visibility do you have today into 2019 in terms of deliveries and potentially starts? Tom Boyle : Yeah Vikram. 2019 I would say still a bit cloudy. We've talked about the level of deliveries that we anticipated through this year, which is likely to hover somewhere around $4 billion. Now that's compared to the $3.5 billion or so that was delivered in 2017. What's not unusual in our business and we're actually seeing this from time to time with some reverse inquiries that we're getting is sites might get entitled, a developer might have own a piece of property for a period of time and then has basically changed direction relative to their own development and intent to actually build a property. So we are seeing a little bit of that coming to us and again I think there's an unknown impact relative to the amount of volume that we're likely to see you come into 2019. The one thing that you would step back and you take a look at our business and there's no question that we've been pleasantly surprised with the amount of resiliency that we've see with the deliveries that have continued to take place not only in our own portfolio, but what we're seeing in a number of markets. So in our case take your Jersey City, we talked about that development a number of times, but that's our largest property. We opened it just a little over a year ago, little over 4,000 units and we just hit another milestone where we've now got 2,000 units leased. Now that's the equivalent of four properties where when we built the property we thought it was going to take us up to four years to stabilize it. We're only a year into it. We're beyond 50% and we've got very good traction and vibrancy. So we've also see again good absorption in a number of our other development. We started our development program in 2013 and with that, we've delivered about 6.5 million square feet three quarter of million dollars of investment. We've seen very good traction and absorption. So the development cycles here, it makes sense for us in many of our market to continue to source and look for development opportunities and our developers out there too that are going to continue to monetize opportunities. Ron talked about it I think on the last call where again when you're able to build to an eight or nine return and monetize it for something like a five, that's 180% margin. So that's something that's going to continue to fuel the development business. I wouldn't say we've seen anything that necessarily is going to change that, but this time back to the resiliency and the things that our business and our product type can create, it's an amazing opportunity for us to continue to see the benefits of doing development where we see it well-placed. Vikram Malhotra : Great. Thank you very much. Tom Boyle : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey guys. So Joe just to kind of stick with supply, just given the fundamentals you're saying revenue has grow high occupancy, the margins are still good, financing still available. There's really no reason that you could see right now out there that it would slow down from these levels. Is that fair? Joe Russell : Well again Jeremy as you know it's a market by market dynamic. On the West Coast for the most part outside of Portland, we're seeing very little dynamic or very little development and frankly we don't anticipate any. It's very tough to find land sites. It's tough to get entitlements and again, we don't see that level of new product coming to our West Coast markets. It's going to be more prone to certain markets that we talk to over the last several quarters like Miami or Raleigh, Charlotte and Atlanta, New York's got its fair share. So and then obviously Dallas and Houston, but again it's tough to peg and see what kind of discipline continues to play through relative to the amount of funding that comes from banks and other source of capital. But again it goes right back to I think the barometer and the governor here is going to be the amount of development return that these developers are going to see with their own development. So we got to see how it plays out, but again to counterbalance all that particular our own portfolio we're seeing actually good traction. So good traction relative to meeting or exceeding our lease up and rental assumptions and we continue to see good reasons to continue developing when we're finding the right land sites and we're finding the right economic returns. Jeremy Metz : Appreciate that and have you seen the supply though spread out into smaller markets at this point? I know you tend to focus on a lot of the bigger ones, but as I push on any of those smaller markets or even have you seen any pullback in the Certificate of Occupancy activity that's been out there? Joe Russell : You know Jeremy at this point I really can't say there's been a shift there yet. So we'll continue to track it, but no I couldn\u2019t tell you right now there's been any material shift yet. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And then last one for me just in terms of transactions, are you seeing cap rates move it on the market whether due to higher capital cost or even just revised revenue expectations at this point? Joe Russell : Well unfortunately not. At some point you would think it would have that kind of an impact but again in the private markets, we're seeing a fair amount of again activity where again there is trading activity of cap rates that we in many cases can't make sense of and in the tertiary markets in particular right now we're seeing some valuations the again in our view make no sense. So we're again not seeing any shift there at the moment. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Thanks for the time. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies. George Hoglund : Hi, just continuing along those lines of acquisition market what are you seeing in terms of the deal flow stuff out there like product is actually coming to market and are you seeing portfolios out there for sale and then also it's how much of stuff you are seeing is kind of recently developed product or stuff that's still in lease up. Joe Russell : Yeah George first quarter is typically not a busy quarter. So we bought three or two assets and then going this quarter we got our eyes on another three, but there is very little portfolio product out there. We've been focused more on one and two type opportunities and we're really not seeing anything pending coming into the market at the moment. Now again it's not unusual that the first quarter in particular is slow. We'll see what play through relative to additional product coming into the market over the next quarter or two. The theme over the last few quarters however has been that level of quality has been lower than we typically like to see and then coupled with the fact that Jeremy was just asking, just the valuations have been beyond ranges that we think are reasonable. So again nothing really new to talk to relatively to the amount of product and/or volume coming in at the moment. George Hoglund : Okay. Thanks and just next one for me, just could you provide an update on Shurgard's performance? Joe Russell : Sure. So Shurgard overall had a good quarter. Revenue was up 3%, expenses flat; they had an NOI of 4.8% for the quarter. So overall very good quarter. Not unlike us. They\u2019ve been continuing to put development and acquisitions in their non-same store pool. At the moment they\u2019ve got 50 properties again seeing good traction relative to lease up and overall activity and trend relative to again the stabilization of the 50 properties. In the quarter they had a little bit of slippage in three other markets from an occupancy standpoint, very minor, but it was France, Sweden and the U.K., but overall they had a very good quarter. George Hoglund : Okay. Thanks. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Hi. Good morning out there. Joe Russell : Good morning. Steve Sakwa : Just a couple quick questions, the non-same store pool I know it's not a huge component of the overall company, but it's still only about 82% leased. Could you just maybe share some thoughts on the timing to maybe get that to a more stabilized level? Joe Russell : So again Steve we've got to your point a growing and we think very opportunistic number of properties and opportunities in our non-same store pool, both through what we've developed and what we've acquired. So year-by-year on the development side, those properties that we develop back in 2013 to '15 cycle are relatively stable at this point. We're seeing good returns in the range of say 8, 9 and 10 plus. So again those are trending well, now that they've had enough time to go through a completely lease-up cycle and then the generation of product that we delivered in '16 and '17 needs more time to mature. All told, the pool of those assets, which again is about three quarters of a billion dollars and 6.5 million square feet is currently generating just north of a 4% return when we are relatively confident that we are going to continue to see opportunities to take it to that 8, 9 plus level. So it's definitely something that is a vibrant part of our forward opportunity relative to revenue growth and not to state the obvious, but you we are the only company that has a development pipeline and we have a full and talented team out there looking for great properties not only on the development front, but again we've had good level of discipline in and out of cycles to go out and find good product that we can acquire as well. So we're very confident about the forward view relative to the earnings power of this portfolio. Steve Sakwa : And not to get too specific on timeframe, but do you think that's a sort of 24 to 36 months sort of reasonable timeframe to be able to? Joe Russell : Well if you kind of think about just again cyclically how it would typically work and again if you point to the 2015 and '16 pool or excuse me, the 2013 to '15 pool that I talked about, it has taken plus or minus about three years to get it up to that level. So that wouldn\u2019t be unusual. Tom Boyle : And this is Tim. I would just add that we added some disclosure in the press release that we hope you find helpful in breaking out the development vintages into groups and you can see the performance of the 2013 to '15 vintage there certainly getting to stabilized occupancies as Joe highlighted but seeing strong rental rate growth in that group as well. Steve Sakwa : Yes I did. Thank you. I guess just quickly switching back to the third-party business, I am just curious what you guys have done in terms of staffing, either internally or externally to either bring new people or transition people into that business and just kind could you give us a little more flavor for how that's unfolding? Joe Russell : So Steve, yeah again I'd just point to, we're in the early stages, Pete Panos who has been with us for 20 plus years knows the operational side of the business cold. So he is leading the team. He is outsourcing a number of individuals who are enjoying his group relative to their focus on third-party management. So he is actively working through that process to get the right sized team built. The great news as we speak as well is that he's got a lot of resources here in the company that he can key off as well. So we've got a great operational team out there that can in the interim answer specific questions any particular owner might have about market rents or other things that they're going to want to have more clarity on coming into our system versus another. So we're confident that the team will get well-rounded as we build that business, it's going to take as a bit of time just to get it completely staffed, but he has got good activity on that front as well. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess last question just any comments on Europe and just kind of the performance there and your expectations for deploying capital there? Joe Russell : Well yeah I just went through how Shurgard did for the first quarter. So I don't know if you were able to hear that or not. Steve Sakwa : Okay. I'll circle back. Joe Russell : Okay. Perfect. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of UBS. Trent Trujillo : Hi this is Trent Trujillo on with Nick. Thanks for taking the time. I appreciate the commentary that you had earlier on the call about move-in in that environment, but I'm curious if you could classify how you perceive the ability to attract new customers and which markets are seeing the most difficult time with absorption since it doesn't always just simply correlate to new supply. Joe Russell : Sure to just to give you a little bit of snapshot there is clearly market differential and move in, move-in rate and were dynamically adjusting both rental rates, promotions and advertising by market, by property, by unit size type etcetera. So certainly have tools in the toolkit for that. To give you a sense of properties or rather markets that are seeing better trends versus weaker trends, Houston is a market where we've seen continued benefits from the hurricanes last fall where move-in trends there have been good. As an example, there are other markets as well even some smaller markets thinking of market like Boston. The bottom performers on move-in tend to be the bottom performers on revenue growth. So some of the weaker markets there, Chicago, Denver, Dallas and some of the market that's highlighted. Trent Trujillo : Okay. Thank you. And I guess as a quick follow-up your advertising and selling expense was down year-over-year. So do you at any point anticipate spending more to attract customers and how effective has your marketing been in terms of customer acquisition cost, thank you. Joe Russell : Sure. So the marketing spend in aggregate was down for the quarter. As we talked about in prior quarters, we did not advertise on television this quarter and we did last quarter, last in the prior comparable quarter such that television advertising expense was down, counterbalancing that was we did spend more on the Internet and so that was a meaningful increase in Internet spending. To give you a sense our Internet spending was up about 40% in the quarter. So we are using that channel and that is a channel that we have advantages on given our brand name. So we get a lot of traction on that channel and it's working well for us in the first quarter into the second quarter. Trent Trujillo : Great. Thank you very much for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Belcher of Wells Fargo. Jason Belcher : Yeah hi. Just a question on your customer mix. I know the business mix, business customer mix has been growing with some of your competitors over the past couple years. Can you share with us where that business customer mix is for you all and how that's trending? Joe Russell : Yeah Jason, we really don't track that specifically nor define it. There is no question we have a sizable number of customers that are businesses of a whole variety that can property to property be different types of businesses whether it's somebody who might have a pharmaceutical rep business or construction firm that needs extra support storage or again there is a whole range of different types of businesses. But frankly we just don't have data that we could share with you that would track and purport, put any kind of proportion. So there's really nothing I can guide you to there. Jason Belcher : Sure. No problem, Then one of the question back on marketing and sorry if I missed this, but can you just remind us what you're doing on TV ad spending? Joe Russell : We did not advertise on television in the quarter and we haven't in the past several quarters either. Tom Boyle : Yeah, I think this is the third quarter in a row we've had zero TV spend. Joe Russell : There is obviously transition going on in television in the way people watch TV so that's something that we're monitoring closely but we did not advertise on television in the quarter. Jason Belcher : All right. Thanks a lot. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisor. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I understand the sector, the definition of full occupancy is ahead of all the last few years with fairly strong fundamentals and I think quarter's occupancy is now down to a five-year low. Can you comment on what you think stabilize occupancies for the portfolio and whether you would be more willing to take a lower moving rate to get a little more fuller occupancy. Joe Russell : Yeah so occupancy is clearly a component of revenue growth and we're constantly seeking to maximize revenue growth. So occupancy as well as rental rate. Different markets have different dynamics both from a demand nature of customer and nature of used case etcetera that drive different behaviors. We generally think about stabilized occupancies as north of 90%. There are some same-store markets that are below 90% today, but generally think about circa 90% as a stabilized occupancy and we're looking at ways constantly of optimizing both occupancy and rental rate to maximize revenue. So I'm not focused purely on occupancy clearly at this point. Tom Boyle : And Eric just to add to that, again if you look at our history over the last say four or five years, again the sector and ourselves we were able to generate occupancy levels that we have never seen before, meeting you could take certain markets and/or property specifically for 95, 96 or even higher seasonally that again prior to this cycle we hadn't seen before and as we speak we have both markets and properties to continue to operate in those occupancy ranges. So again it goes back to part of the attraction into this business in general, because on a month to month lease basis I mean we're still able to capture and drive occupancies to level that until recently weren\u2019t thought were possible. So talks to again not only the benefits or the vibrancy of the vibrancy of the business but you some of our own capabilities role relative to the way work on attracting customers duration of customers stay and you know in many markets where we frankly don't have additional competition and we've got great opportunities keep our properties very full. Eric Frankel : Okay. Appreciate the context, just one last question. Joe obviously you have a fairly long career in the commercial real industry especially with PS business parks and more general in the office industrial sectors, obviously Public Storage is one of the founders in the self storage industry and is obviously probably has pretty good operating chops, but have you found from your past experience anyway that you think you could enhance value to the platform? Joe Russell : Well again Eric I've been in the family Europe Public Storage we're not 16 years and you and I got to know each other in my prior role in PS Business Parks. A lot of similarities culturally and then even the way we approach the business relative to the level of focus intensity and drive is necessary to run a business that does have a commanding level of day-to-day customer involvement in our case here Public Storage we got 1.5 million customers. But we got a great strong team and there is a lot of our rigor that goes into keeping the portfolios optimize each and every day and you John and Ron have you crafted in put a lot of great metrics and techniques and processes in the business that frankly is led the industry to levels as I was just talking about that many thought weren\u2019t possible. So with Tom and I coming in now again it's not to come in and re-craft or reset that at all. It's really defined to continue to enhance all ways to continue to optimize the business. So lot of things that frankly we don't want to change. We have the best balance sheet in the industry. We've got the only brand in the industry, Great scale out in our markets. We're the only public entity that's got a development program and its thriving. We're now entering third-party management. So we're going to continue to be creative and focused and Tom and I are excited about the future here. Eric Frankel : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Hi. I was wondering can you talk a little bit about some of the basics of on-boarding for the new third-party management business. Specifically when you bring a property on board, to what extent do you reflag it, who bears those costs and basic stuff like that? Joe Russell : So yeah Mike, those are good questions a little premature for us to actually talk to the specifics yet, but those are many of the elements that as we speak we are basically structuring the business around. So not only taking a look at how the industry has done this, but what new and different elements will be part of our onboarding process you as we can look at either properties that come out into the portfolio in one offer portfolio basis. So those are all things that we're working through right now and give us a little bit more time. We'll be able to go into those details in the future. Mike Mueller : Great. Okay. Thank you. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from Smedes Rose of Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey it's Michael Bilerman with Smedes. I just had a couple of follow-up questions, Joe in terms of Ron and John's involvement through the retirement at the end of the year. I take it public quarterly conference calls is out at this point? Joe Russell : Well based on what's happening today, yes, but again the transition that has been evolving Michael over the last literally now almost a couple years, Tom and I came into Public Storage almost at the same time. So basically the midpoint of 2016. So Ron and John are here. They are highly engaged in the company. They are great resources for both Tom and I to being and get advice and input and their retirement is that but it's also one where we clearly have no exposure relative to losing their institutional knowledge because they're going to be active trustees. And Tom and I will be able to continue to rely on them for all kinds of things that we're excited to go and tackle. Michael Bilerman : And how are you thinking about investor communications and I don\u2019t if Ryan has a different view on this as well and I take it there wasn't a lot of change this quarter with no opening comments, plus that I do appreciate breaking up the development and the like between the peers but really no added disclosure in your press release, the 10K includes a bunch of information, but clearly PSA is well behind its peer set from a disclosure perspectives. Do you and/or Ryan have a different view going forward about disclosure and what you're going to give to the street? Joe Russell : Yeah Michael we continue to solicit feedback and when and where we think additional disclosures are helpful and as Tom mentioned earlier, we did put additional information even into the press release. So we're going to be open and your fluid with any dialogue that we would like to hear from you and others. So let us know but we'll see how things play for. Michael Bilerman : But I guess coming in you decided to go out and hire self side analysts that certainly has got a different viewpoint I would assume than prior leadership perhaps, do you have a desire mean you can print up everyone supplemental, there is volumes of detail that others put out that you don't. Joe Russell : Well I would just point to the fact that again we've -- even with disclosures over time those continue to change and we'll be receptive, but it's not and I wouldn't take Ryan to add to the team as you some new and very different strategy tied to again the way that we continue provide information we do definitely want to be as transparent as we have been historically and will continue to solicit feedback. Michael Bilerman : You mentioned on the development specifically three quarters to $1 billion of capital. Can you break out if you are to look in your press release the NOI for the '18, '17, '16 acquisitions in then the two levels of development and then the other facilities which I think are the ones were you embarked on redevelopment, how much capital has been spent for each of those so that we can better understand in place yield and then how much NOI is on the comp, so that as we model, we can model that upturn over the next few years, you obviously don't give guidance. So having that information would be helpful. Joe Russell : Again Michael we'll look to the level information that we think is appropriate and best suited to give you guys the amount of information you need. So I am not going to specifically answer those direct elements, but we'll take the feedback and see what we can do going forward. Michael Bilerman : Right, as you have the '16 and '17 details in your K, do I can pull those out, $280 million and $430 million, how much money have you spent on the 13 to 18 development that are currently producing the $3 million and $4.3 million of annualized -- of quarterly NOI should be an easy number to have. Joe Russell : Yeah and again I think some of that informational I'll play through in the 10Q as well. So 10Q is going to be out in the next week or so. So I would look to that as well? Michael Bilerman : Okay. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks. Just two quick questions. One, as sort of the quarter progressed and particularly towards the end of the quarter, it seemed like sort of rate and occupancy decelerated, I'm wondering if tactically you drop created there try to get occupancy up and tied to that, you had I think it was an effort may be a couple of quarters ago to select certain markets and drop rate quite dramatically. Anything like that on the cards for this year? Tom Boyle : Sure. So on your first question, we actually saw modestly better trends in March compared to February. So as I spoke about take rates being down 4%, take rates were down 5% in February down 4% in March and actually while I describe move-in being down, in aggregate for the quarter March was positive for move in. So if anything trends, we're better in March than earlier in the quarter, which obviously is a good thing as we prep for the rental rates or the rental season here in the next several months. Your next question was on whether we're doing anything specific market to market in terms of lowering rates dramatically and there's been no recent strategies to dramatically lower rates, although obviously we are dynamically changing rental rates as we go on a day-to-day basis. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just one last one, from a I think maybe a year ago, maybe a year and half ago, there was a view that stabilization would be sort of defined by in store revenue trending towards long-run average and we're certainly below that now. I'm just wondering if you look out whether it's six months to 12 months, what is stabilization from here on and are there any -- is there a view that you could see some reacceleration towards the year-end? Joe Russell : Look we have a busy season and rental season goes here and we can talk about that more as we go through 2018. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just wanted to clarify something, you guys said you're sending out more rent increase letters, did that means just seasonally that you're sending out more now, or are going to send out more or did you mean on a year-over-year basis\u2026 Joe Russell : I meant seasonally. So as we get into May, June and July, we send out more during that time period. Obviously rental rates are up and there is strong demand for backfilling any vacancy. So a good time to be sending out rental rate increases and those are our largest months. Ki Bin Kim : Okay and just following up on that, do you expect percentage of customers that would receive one this year. Would that look similar to what you've done historically or better or worse? Joe Russell : Very consistent. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you again. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now return the call to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Laurie and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We'll look forward to catching up again on the next quarter call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Public Storage first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Public Storage Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Krystal. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the second quarter 2018 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements, other than statements of historical facts included on this call, are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements. These risks and other factors that could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 2, 2018, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide both included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and audio webcast replay of this conference call on our Web site at www.publicstorage.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thanks, Ryan and thank you all for joining us. This quarter we continued to see the resiliency of our business in the face of the supply pressure impacting the self storage industry. Before we open the call for question, I want to highlight that we have lined up the timing of our earnings release our 10-Q in this call. We feel that our 10-Q addresses a number of questions and data points that some of you have requested and this will ensure the full disclosure package is in everyone's hands. Our Q, particularly the MD&A section is detailed so please continue to look at that document as the guide to how we evaluate the status of the business. Now I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : [Technical Difficulty] increase in the amount of deliveries and expectations for deliveries, particularly as we start to think about \u201819, versus \u201818 and is the right way to look at it from an fundamental perspective, a three-year rolling window given the lease up time on new assets in your mind. Joe Russell : Juan, unfortunately, I missed the very first part of your question. But if you\u2019re talking about our outlook and view of supply -- but it was the context of the question was, so let me give you little bit of color on what we see. And that\u2019s both deliveries and the timing that it would take -- typically take place as we know in our business. With any given delivery there's plus or minus a three year lease up on a per property basis. So 2017 and 2018, we expect very similar, if not elevated, levels of deliveries this year over last. Going into \u201919, there is some commentary and data out there that potentially points to a slowdown in deliveries. But realistically that, to some degree, is just the way the development business works, some of the things that can prolong or delay deliveries include timing tied to entitlement approvals or permit approvals. There could also be delays again based on any particular developers\u2019 view of market conditions, cost tied to either labor or materials, particularly steel in the case of self-storage properties. But all that said, we\u2019re still in an environment more often than not and market-to-market where developers are still seeing healthy returns when they can build the property that ultimately will yield anything from the 8% to 9% return and potentially flip it for five or six. And whether those development margins are more extreme or elevated at say 80% or even taper down in half, there is still a lot of people out there and capital that\u2019s putting development dollars into the cycle. The thing that may happen that we would certainly look as a positive is with some of the potential headwinds tied to either the amount of supply hitting markets some of the pro forma being changed, maybe some pushback from lenders and frankly, just expectations to the overall return to properties, there could be some slow down but too hard to see. And our view is, again, the amount of capital that continues to want to be placed in this sector elevated, it's still a business that continues to produce very good returns on a property-by-property basis, and the development cycle is still with us. So with that, I really don't have a lot more specific color other than we'll continue to track and see what we see throughout our markets going into 2019. Juan Sanabria : And then The Street rates, if I may. Any sense or could you give us any color around what they were year-over-year in the second quarter and maybe third quarter to-date. And if we step back and think you've had declining numbers for a couple quarters at least. And do you think of that as a leading indicator for where same-store revenue should eventually migrate to? Tom Boyle : The Street rates in the quarter were down roughly 4%. As we've talked about in the past and as we disclose in the 10-Q review, take rates or moving rates as more meaningful. So as you saw in the 10-Q that we filed last night, the move-in rates on a per square foot basis were down 2% in the quarter. Between second quarter and first quarter, we did lower our rates high volumes during our kick-off to summer sale. And we were pleased by the demand response from the customer base during that sale versus prior years. Though, breaking the quarter down by month, April and May, we're down roughly 2% so similar to the first quarter performance. And then we clearly decided to lower rates during the sale to drive customer response. On a holistic basis looking at move-in revenue, so both the amount of space leased as well as the rate that contract rent for all move-ins was down 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. But the flipside was that the contract ramp in aggregate so again, volume and rate for move-outs, was down 3.6% and that was driven by reduction in move-out activity. So that just continues to point existing customer base, stickiness and stability that we've talked about. And that's continued here as we've gone through the second quarter and into the third quarter as we send out our existing tenant rate increases. So speaking of move-ins and move-outs on a volume basis, occupancy trends improved because of the difference between move-in volumes and move-out volumes. So that's a good trend. The occupancy ended the quarter down 100 basis points and down 60 basis points on average, which compares to down 90 basis points on average in the first quarter. So we did see some occupancy improvement through the second quarter on a sequential basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Joe, the comments that you just made about potential positives to the development cycle either pro forma is being changed or pushed back from lenders. Are you seeing changes to pro formas or are you changing your pro formas at all? And then on the lending side, I'm guessing you're not in the market talking to lenders. Was that comment hypothetical in nature, or is there any evidence that lenders are starting to push back or tighten up around development funding? Joe Russell : Todd, there is definitely some anecdotal impressions we get through a variety of conversation that we have with a lot of groups out there. One of the things that add to that is the dialog we\u2019re actually having on a reverse enquiry basis where we are seeing more entitles land parcels coming to us through owners that were planning on taking a property through a development cycle and have now decided not to do. So that would include circumstances like I alluded to where again they\u2019ve either shifted down their expectations from a rental rate and/or time to occupy the property, interest rates, they haven\u2019t move materially but certainly, the opinion out there is that they\u2019re likely to increase. There is likely more pressure coming from interest rate cost. And with that I think there is some tapering down from a dialogue standpoint that again there could be either delays or intentional movement away from the level of full deliveries that\u2019s statistically were predicted for 2019. I can\u2019t tell you it going to be down 10%, 50% but there could be some of that in the mix. And again with other elements at hand again with construction costs, there\u2019s market-to-market around labor and anecdotal, as I mentioned. Again, I think there is some rethinking relative to the pool of developers that were one, or two, or three years ago, just looking at everything being completely full steam ahead. They could build these properties, flip them very quickly, not worry about achieving pro formas and now all of a sudden there\u2019s a little bit more review and/or nap going on, which I think holistically is very good, our overall industry and is good market-to-market. But I couldn\u2019t tell you it\u2019s really something that\u2019s become just yet so we\u2019ll have to see how those play forward. Todd Thomas : And then I was wondering if you could talk about how conditions have trended through July, whether or not you can comment at all on occupancy or rent trends? And as you head into the off-peak season here and the summer winds down, any thoughts around your strategy as it pertains to discount and promotions? Tom Boyle : So I would call July trends very consistent with what we saw in the second quarter, both in terms of occupancy and rate, so nothing really to highlight there. I think in terms of moving through the summer, clearly, we\u2019ll continue to monitor our existing tenant base and how they\u2019re accepting the rental rate increases. So far to-date, they continue to demonstrate the stickiness that we\u2019ve observed in the second quarter. And as it relates to pricing and promotion, that\u2019s something we obviously dynamically adjust. But we\u2019ve historically continued to offer dollar special discounts through the summer period and then sprinkling in sales as well. So we\u2019d expect to do that similar to how we\u2019ve done it over the past several years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I realized it\u2019s hard to maybe compare, or you don\u2019t maybe have full understanding of what the peers do and maybe you can\u2019t speak to their operations. But there are couple of large markets where your revenue growth does seem to be trailing behind some of your peers. And I'm just wondering if you\u2019ve got any thoughts around that. I think Chicago in DC, are two markets in particular where your revenue growth trailed noticeably behind. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s new supply specifically or there something else in those markets said is pulling your performance down? Joe Russell : So obviously, we can begin with something that we talked to you in the past, which is the way that we hold properties in or not into same-store. So there likely is some GAAP of performance tied to that. There could be market-to-market distinctions, based on location of assets. And again, you would also need to take a look at levels of occupancy and market-to-market what\u2019s going on there. And then clearly, our goal has always been to maximize revenue per square foot on a per property basis. So even though in some markets, you may look at those distinctions like we highlighted, we would also want you to take a look at what's trending and it\u2019s all reported. Again, peer-to-peer, the cash flow per market that takes place across our various portfolios. And I think you there would see a distinct difference. Now you mentioned Chicago, we talked about Chicago it's one of our toughest markets. And for many reasons not supply as much but more economic and overall migrations either out or not flowing into that particular Metro area has continued to be a tough market. So in that case, there's definitely more of a factor there. DC, a little bit more supply coming into the market. But again, as you mentioned Chicago for us has been a market, we\u2019ve talked to now for several quarters, it\u2019s one of our weakest. Steve Sakwa : So there you might think, it's a submarket differential perhaps between some of the peers and you just different parts in town maybe? Joe Russell : That could be a component. Steve Sakwa : And then just flipping gears here maybe a little bit on the technology side, some of your peers were doing some different things to attract tenants and to lease space some or almost automated leasing. What are you guys doing, if any and is there anything you can share with us about some of those programs and some of the effectiveness that you might be having? Joe Russell : So we continue to invest and optimize all the things that we do to attract and learn about customer behavior. So there are many things that are proprietary that we continue to do that we don't talk thoroughly or transparently about. But we clearly have a number of committed initiatives that continue to enhance our ability to attract and find what we feel are good quality customers, and customers that we think to our locations well and that again lead us to being able to do many things on a per property basis. We have now fully integrated a new point-of-sale system that took us several years to develop that was integrated and fully implemented across the company at the end of 2017. So not only is that a more vibrant system, but it's giving us much more clarity relative to the things that we can do to enhance customer experience and customer knowledge. So from a focus and technology standpoint, we continue to do a variety of things. And we continue to see good traction from both investment and our techniques that comes from that. Steve Sakwa : And lastly for me, could you just maybe speak to the third-party management business that you rolled out I guess a couple of quarters ago and some of the traction that you may be having with existing owners in the marketplace today? Joe Russell : Steve, just as you said, we obviously launched in and made the announcement that we're going to go into the third-party management business earlier in the year. I'd say overall, we've been very pleased with the reaction and frankly, it's been better than expected. Pete Panos has now hired his team. So we have a team around Pete that focuses down on business development, customer relations and brand integration. Up until this point, the efforts that we've had have been primarily tied to dealing with reverse enquiries, which has been strong and healthy. And we really haven't even started our major outbound initiatives yet but that's coming. The point we're at right now is we have 48 signed properties and the program and the backlog continues to grow. And if you combine that with our 26 legacy properties that we've run for several years, we've now got 74 properties in the program. What we're seeing is -- again, a lot of the strong reaction tied to the value of our brand. The amount of consistent cash flow and revenue we do produce on a per property basis, because I can tell you owners are very fixated on that. They also like the scale and market knowledge that we have market-to-market. And our ongoing capabilities again, that we continue to drive through our technology, just like you were asking. So overall the program\u2019s off to a great start and we're encouraged by what we're going to be able to see going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Just piggybacking off that question, those 48 newly signed up for a party management deals. Are you able to provide color on how many of those were previously managed by other third-party managers and how many of them are just maybe new projects? Joe Russell : George, I'll talk to maybe holistically the entire pool that we're dealing with. So not surprisingly but encouragingly, we are seeing a variety of different types of situations come to us. So it includes properties that are in development. It includes properties that are currently flagged by other operators, both public and private. And it includes operators that are just running the properties themselves, so we're seeing a good combination. And as I mentioned, this has really been without us actually going intentionally out to markets yet in an outbound way. So again out of the gates, we've had very good strong reaction from a good collection of different types of situations. We are pleased with the quality of the assets that are coming into the pool. And we think, based again on what we're seeing right now, we can fold them into operational platform pretty easily. And again, that's another advantage that many of these owners look to right out of the gate once we again put the Public Storage brand on the property. George Hoglund : And then also going back to development, are you seeing more development migrate into the secondary markets? And if so which areas are you seeing more flow to? Joe Russell : I really couldn\u2019t tell you George that there is fee change that would lead you to say now -- into either secondary or more markets because frankly we have a very fragmented industry as a whole. And there are developers out there [Technical Difficulty] of the countries that are looking to build this type of product. So I think the currents that are out there is no question in some of the more highly urbanized market that\u2019s going to be more difficult entitlement situations, land is not going to be available. Again, more headwinds that you\u2019re going to hit there, whether as storage facility can be built on a particular site because of pressure and community relative to caps and the amount of storage products that might be already in place, those properties typically are going to be more expensive. But again I wouldn\u2019t tell you there is any overall fee change in where the overall development is happening, because again, it continues to be pronounced. George Hoglund : And just last one from me. On the acquisition front, are you seeing an increase in opportunities out there. And are there going to be or do you see more opportunities from development projects? Joe Russell : So this disconnect between what seller expectations and buyer pro formas or buyer expectations are still wrong, so based on that we\u2019re not seeing a healthy or high level of trading that\u2019s going on out there. So there really hasn\u2019t been much of a change. So cap rates for the most part are relatively in the same type zone, they hover around say a 5 or so handle. And again, we\u2019re not really seeing a lot of volume coming into the market. Now what we\u2019ve done in this environment, both last year and this year, is we continue to look at opportunities where we can buy really good properties at good values, we\u2019re able to round out our presence. And a number of markets where we\u2019d like to have more scale. More recently this year, you\u2019ve seen us do it with some of the one off acquisitions and communities like Louisville, Omaha, Columbia, South Carolina, you saw in our press release we\u2019ve got 14 properties under contract. Those 14 properties totaled about [$95 million] a little over 840,000 square feet. Again same thing as part of that portfolio does or part of that whole group of properties does include a small portfolio in Minneapolis. But again, we\u2019re not seeing a new range or a healthy level of portfolio volume getting traded right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : I was hoping you can just touch upon the development opportunity in your portfolio. I understand you took four properties out of your same store pool presumably to enter into expansion projects. Maybe you can touch upon given maybe that some of your sites are older and little bit less utilized. What redevelopment opportunities are available over the long-term? Thank you. Joe Russell : If you look at the Q on page 45, we have a little bit more color on some of the activity that we have and our expansion efforts. And one of the things that we've been able to do since we started our development program in 2013 as opportunities have evolved in our own portfolio, we\u2019re starting to shift even more dollars into redevelopment and expansion. So again on page 45, it\u2019s actually footnote A, you can see what we highlighted relative to some of the demolished properties that we\u2019ve touched this year, which total about 665,000 square feet and rentable square footage. And over the next 18 months, we\u2019ve got another 150 or so thousand. So that pool as we speak today is a little over 800,000 square feet. So to put a little color on that and give you a view of how we look at that economically, so if you look about 800,000 square feet, on an annual basis that generates about $8.2 million in NOI. Now, we\u2019re taking that 800,000 pool property set and expanding it almost by 4, little over 4 times to 3.9 million square feet. We\u2019re investing $364 million into those properties expansion. And if you compare the yields that we continue to see on our mainline development program where ultimately we can get these properties conservatively into say an A or higher yield, that pool alone once stabilized is going to generate instead of $8.2 million in NOI, it will generate if you assume a 5% or if you assume an 8% to 10% yield, you\u2019re going to see $55 million NOI level, so again very strong and healthy level of continued performance and opportunity. And Eric, we\u2019ve just begun to look at this and with the amount properties that we've got throughout many markets, we think we\u2019ve got good long term opportunities with that pool. Eric Frankel : Geographically, where have you found these redevelopment opportunities thus far? Joe Russell : So it\u2019s a little bit, I wouldn\u2019t say everywhere, but we were encouraged because some of the areas that make most sense is where we can easily just again add a facility to a property without touching existing inventory or existing building. So in many markets say with some of our legacy assets, we might have extra land and/or parking area that's pretty simple to expand and convert. And then in other areas that you take one we just finished up in Milpitas up in the Silicon Valley again same thing, but it's an infill location. Literally, we could never buy that property again, because again, there is no land available in that market. And if it were to become available, it would trade us something extreme. So we've got those pockets of opportunities throughout the portfolio. So again, we\u2019re encouraged by what we can continue to do long-term in many of our markets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gaule with SunTrust. Ian Gaule : I\u2019m here with Ki Bin. First question on your rent rolls and Q2 is typically flat to slightly positive and then 2Q last year was a little bit negative and this year to fell off. So I\u2019m just curious is that something that worries you guys and could the rent increase program that was once a tailwind become a headwind? Joe Russell : There is some seasonality and the difference between our move-in rates and our move-out rates. And if you go back several years you\u2019ll see that seasonality play out. I think if you go back -- looking back longer term, I think there was a quarter back in 2015 where we rolled up in the difference between move-ins and move-outs. But for the most part, you do see some rent roll down for some of the reasons you highlighted. As I mentioned earlier, we did see good traction on move-ins with our reduced rate in the month of June and the end of May, and that certainly contributed to the rent roll down increase year-over-year. But as you point out, last year we saw rent roll down as well. So it's a component of our revenue, which is balanced with the revenue benefit from the stickiness of our existing tenant base and the existing tenant rate increase that we do send out. Ian Gaule : If I look at your end of period occupancy, which is down about 100 bps and then contract trend was about 1.7 in the quarter. That would imply sub-1% same-store revenue in 3Q. Is that a fair way to think of it? Are you going to be below 1% or right around there in the back half? I'm just curious if I'm missing something. Tom Boyle : So that is a metric that we've pointed to over past calls as a sign of -- at the last day of the quarter where contract rents are and where occupancy is, so the most recent data points. And if you look at the end of period occupancy 110 basis points and the contract rent would point to something like 0.6% revenue in the next quarter. At the same time, we've talked about the difference between end of period and average occupancy given some of the changes that we've seen in our customer move-out patterns. And so looking at an occupancy average over the quarter of 0.6% and using that number would point to a little north of 1% is another data point. We talked about last quarter those same metrics pointed to 1.5% to 1.8% rental income growth and we came in at the quarter at 1.7%. So there is -- historically been some correlation between that. It's not a perfect number, because [Technical Difficulty] doing a quarter, but it's the most data points on rent and occupancy that we've disclosed. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital. Jeremy Metz : Tom, you just touched on the existing customer rate increases a bit and you talked about looking at the importance of take rate. But in terms of looking at revenue growth, the 1.5%, can you talk about how much is being driven by being existing customer rate increases at this point and then any changes in the amount of increase your frequency or number of customers getting those? Tom Boyle : The increase in the rent roll down was certainly a negative to rental rate growth through the quarter. So the existing tenant rate increases was a meaningful portion of the revenue growth. And there has been no change, from a strategy standpoint, to how we send those out. As I\u2019ve talked about in the past, we do send out more of those through the summer months, rates are high as activity in terms of backfilling any vacates is good during this time period, so it makes a lot of sense to send out those existing tenant rate increases around this time of year. And we\u2019ve seen good receptivity to those so no changes there but that is driving our revenue growth at this point. Jeremy Metz : And then switching to supply, your predecessor talked a lot about the impact certificate of occupancy deals we\u2019re having on development activity. As you look at the market today, are you still seeing a fair amount of activity out there ad is there any insight on the pricing trends relative to cap rate you can give just in terms of what you\u2019re seeing? I know you guys obviously don\u2019t do any of those, but just wondering how aggressive folks still are being on that front. Tom Boyle : Jeremy, I think thematically, it\u2019s the same set of issues that I talked about before, which is, there is a healthy development community out there that continues to see good returns when they\u2019re able to develop these properties. And again, if they can build into an eight or nine and they can flip them full or unoccupied at a rent level that would yield off of full occupancy or close to it or five or six, I mean they\u2019re going to keep doing it. But we do engage and have -- we have actually bought here and there some deals, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that those are necessarily becoming more stressed, but they\u2019re out there. I think some are going to continue to come into the market, but it\u2019s too soon yet to tell if there is any overall stress that\u2019s coming with again those properties that are coming into the market. Jeremy Metz : And just the last one from me, and I was wondering if you could just comment on advertising and selling costs, they were down again this quarter. I know some of that -- TV spend, but I would just think with supply and the demand pressure you\u2019ve talked about here that maybe we\u2019d see you try to ramp that and maybe to create more demand into the funnel. So any color you can provide on that line? Tom Boyle : So advertising was down 5% in the quarter, but as you point out that was driven by TV spend in the prior year. Our Internet spend was up in the quarter, up 33% that\u2019s primarily Google, and that\u2019s a combination of that landscape remaining competitive and cost per click moving higher, as well as our pushing on that to drive volume. And that\u2019s the channel of advertising that we like, it can be very targeted and trackable and down to the property level. So there is a lot of ability to use technology and our systems to drive demand on a very granular basis. And so we\u2019ve been doing that more and more. In addition, we do have an advantage online which is our brand. And so we drive a significant amount of volume on the Internet even away from the page search, so focus there remains very strong coming through channels like local maps. And so certainly a focus there on driving customer volume and this is the last quarter that you\u2019ll hear us talking about TV in the prior year. So we won\u2019t have that of a reduction in -- TV is something that we continue to monitor. TV is going through transition, but we\u2019re monitoring television and television like advertising media as potentials to drive traffic to our stores as well, but no immediate plans there. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just a couple quick ones, just following up on that stimulating demand question. If you can just help us understand a little bit for that incremental dollar when you're deciding between Internet spend versus reducing rates versus increasing discounts. If you can provide a little bit more color on what goes into each bucket and how you decide how to allocate those dollars that would be helpful? Joe Russell : So that's a pretty dynamic judgment that\u2019s made on a very local basis, and that depends on both the traffic, the characteristics of that local market and its response, both in the past and in current to those different tools that we have in our toolkit. So I don\u2019t I'll talk about that at a high level, but just say that that's a property-by-property judgments that is made through our technology and our systems. And they are certainly integrated, i.e. moving the levers between discounting, lower asking rates, high channel pricing and advertising, are all different tools we have in our toolkit. Ronald Kamdem : And then if I could go back to the revenue growth expectations, I think you already mentioned on the revenue growth for the rest of the year. Just try to understand what the upside or downside risks could be for the end of the year. Is it through rents or is it through occupancy where there's more leverage to either surprise on the upside or on the downside? Tom Boyle : Again I think that really is a market-by-market judgment, want to see how the rest of the year plays out. But there is certainly markets where we view that there is occupancy potential to improve and there's other markets where occupancy is actually really quite healthy; you look at Los Angeles where we have 95% occupancy, same with San Francisco or New York, those are places where occupancy is really quite good. And so the opportunity is probably more a rate basis once you get into those types of occupancies. But not all our markets are at 95% so there's occupancy potential as well. Ronald Kamdem : And the last one from me, I saw on the queue all the markets in terms of supply dealing with new supply. I was just wondering if there's any markets that are early on you're seeing that there is potential sign it could have supply issues in the future. Joe Russell : That supply could come into those markets, Ronald? Ronald Kamdem : That\u2019s right\u2026 Joe Russell : There is a couple that we\u2019ve talked about in last quarter or two. Portland, Oregon for instance, has number of deliveries coming in to that market. And Nashville is another market that we\u2019re keeping a close eye on; again, a lot of vibrancy from an overall MSA standpoint but development too. So we\u2019re tracking the outset of deliveries, particularly in those two markets and keeping a close eye on them. Portland in particular, hasn\u2019t seen a lot of development in several years but for a number reasons there are a lot of properties that began -- are predicted to start. Again, goes back to that same thing that I talked about at the beginning of the call, which is even though some of these properties are being tracked, you really don't know clearly when they\u2019re going to start until they do. But Portland is definitely one that we\u2019re keeping a close eye on. Operator : Our next question comes from Hong Zhang with JP Morgan. Hong Zhang : I was just curious if you\u2019ve seen a change in behavior from your peers in the third-party management space. Now that sounds like you've got a decent amount of positive reception from just various operators? Joe Russell : No, I mean, we're early into this, Hong. So again we are definitely looking at the business as something that's got a lot of vibrancy. The other platforms have done well in the business and we'll see how the entire business changes now that we're involved in it as well. But I couldn't tell you directly if we\u2019ve seen anything change directly and what we hear and know so far relative to what strategies or programs that they're either running or changing. So couldn't tell you that yet. Hong Zhang : And I guess just follow-up question from me, so it is hypothetically like a operator were to come to you, just from -- one of your peers to you for third party management to onboard and rebrand them? Joe Russell : I'm not really sure I follow the question\u2026 Hong Zhang : I guess if I were signed up with one of your competitors for third party management right now. And I would go to and I want to switch to Public Storage. How long will it take for me to get on board into your system to put the Public Storage [Multiple Speakers]? Joe Russell : Well that's going to depend, situation-by-situation. From what we understand over time that has been some interplay, both within the public operators and even the private operators. There are a number of private or party operators to. So the timing of that depends on a lot of things. It depends on the owners\u2019 desire, how quickly they would want to make the change; again, are there implications tied to changing personality properties; again, it could take anywhere from a couple of months to several. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Just going back to the period end data points as a leading indicator. Could you just give us a sense of where spot occupancy is today relative to last year on a same-store basis? Joe Russell : Spot occupancy is similar from a trend standpoint to prior year today as it was at the end of the quarter, as I highlighted occupancy improved through the quarter. So looking at the average occupancies through the quarter, you had April and May, down 60 to 70 basis points in June, finishing down roughly 30 basis points on an average basis and we're seeing similar in July. So occupancy trends have continued to be more favorable as we\u2019re going through 2018. Juan Sanabria : And then just on the expense side. Is there any offset from what look to be tougher comps from the second half of last year that you have and the second half of \u201918 that limit the pressures from those tough comps from last year? Or how should we think about expense growth on a same store basis? Joe Russell : I think looking at this quarter and going back in time the expense line item that is likely the most pressure as we go through the year as property taxes. And you saw in the quarter property taxes up 5.5% that\u2019s an area where both state and local governments are driving increases in assessments and we\u2019d expect that to continue as we go through the year here. So we disclosed in our queue that we\u2019d expect that to continue. I think beyond that -- I think the puts and takes clearly focused on expense management and other areas. And so we\u2019ll look at expense in general plus or minus 3% as we got clearly -- in the first quarter, we were a little above that, second quarter we were little bit below that, but that\u2019s a fair number. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I just want to ask you, you received a large cash payment from Shurgard. Does that change anything around acquired dividend distributions or does that count as part of your taxable income, or that\u2019s different from a redistribution perspective? Joe Russell : So we did receive a dividend and in terms of rationale for that dividend and the drivers there, the cash reform that was passed at the end of last year required us in 2017 to recognize income associated with our international operations like other multinational companies. That is at an advantage grade, so from a taxable income standpoint, there is an advantage to that recognition but we needed to recognize that in 2017. So this cash dividend is in effect the cash associated with that income and we took our 49% share and our partner took the remainder. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask you, I don\u2019t know if you have this. But when you look at the percent supply increases in the market that you\u2019re in, I guess across your portfolio. I mean do you have a sense of what your own development or expansion activities are as a percent of that total supply coming into market? I mean is it significant or is it relatively small piece of the whole? Joe Russell : Smedes, that\u2019s going to vary market-to-market but again [Technical Difficulty], say in 2017 so nationally around $3.5 billion. Our own development program was about $300 million. This year development activities likely to be around $4 billion, our development platform is going to be about $400 million. So again, if not a significant percentage and the thing that we will continue to take advantage of though, is we may in certain markets be a higher percentage of the development activity, but more often not that\u2019s intentional that\u2019s a good thing. Meaning, we\u2019ve got one of these infill sites, whether it\u2019s an own property that we\u2019re expanding or we\u2019ve been able to get hold of a great piece of property. But we continually look at the competitive activity that\u2019s going on in a particular submarket, the competition ratio, again population dynamics, all those things. And we put a lot of analysis into the way we make those decisions to literally launch, whether it\u2019s a new development or redevelopment property. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Burke. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Krystal. And thanks again to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to connecting with you in this venue again next quarter. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you, Ryan and thank you for joining us. We had a good quarter. I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. I am just hoping you guys could speak a little bit about your tech initiatives, I think you guys have launched a new web platform which is pretty all-encompassing. I was hoping you could just give us an update on that and the benefits you have seen and how that should impact core results and earnings over time? Joe Russell : Okay. Thanks Juan. Yes, the frontline or customer interface system you are talking to is what we call Web Champ 2. So Web Champ 2 is both the interface from customers to employees and it\u2019s also our inventory system. It has a number of attributes that we built over several years and fully now have implemented it throughout the company. We started integrating it into our properties in early 2017 to finish by the end of the year. So now we are coming up to a full year of its use. And the levels of benefits tied to it are several. First of all, it\u2019s built around a very high degree of customer interface. So, it includes speed of transactions, knowledge of customer, tools that the property manager and the district manager can use to enhance not only our movement activity, but the ways in which other ways in which we can encourage our customers to stay with us. And it\u2019s also a paperless system. So, it has a number of other advantages relative to just the day-to-day operations as well. Now, those are some of the headlines of the system. The other things that over time it will continue to give us benefits around are the ways in which that we grow and understand customer behavior and the knowledge that we have relative to not only the existing customers, plus or minus today about 1.5 million customers, so we got a big pool of existing customers, but even year-to-date, we have moved in nearly 900,000 customers. So the system is working great. We are getting a lot of good traction out of it. It\u2019s a system that we can continue, like I mentioned continues to enhance over time and its inherent design is included in a number of things that we integrate from, again, customer sourcing, revenue management and other things, but a lot of that\u2019s highly proprietary. But I can tell you that we are very pleased with the success the system is bringing to us and efficiencies and knowledge that we continued to gain to optimize our overall environment. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then just a follow-up question if you don\u2019t mind on the occupancy front from a same-store perspective that\u2019s kind of declined consistently the last few quarters, at what point do you think that you will have easier comps and that occupancy will stabilize at least from the same-store perspective? Tom Boyle : Sure. Juan, so it\u2019s Tom speaking. Occupancy trends throughout the year have frankly been encouraging on a year-over-year basis. So while we have had year-over-year declines we have seen some positive momentum there. And the hurricanes this quarter in particular mask some of that benefit. So if you look at the occupancy at quarter end for example which was down 1.2%, if you look at the system as a whole excluding the hurricane markets it\u2019s down 0.8%. So there have been some positive trends there. I think generally speaking, we have talked about this in the past with system as a whole before supply really started impacting us in 2016 was north of 96% occupied and there is no question we have been impacted by the opening of new facilities. In many markets which I won\u2019t rattle off here as you know them where occupancy has been more impacted than otherwise. Looking at our markets this quarter we are still looking at Los Angeles 95.4%, San Francisco 94.8%, so very healthy occupancies. And again system wide, I think we are seeing some encouraging trends as we step through 2018. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeremy Metz, BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys. Hey, Joe. Can you just give us an update on your outlook for supply here looking out into the rest of this year and 2019 and any changes, if I would have look at just where deals are trading in the market on a per square foot basis and I look at where you are building today, that spread remains pretty attractive and lending is more or less still available, so wondering why supply would tail off if developers can still get these sort of margins out there? Joe Russell : Okay. Yes. Thanks Jeremy. So yes, let me give you a little bit of view on the way we track supply and some of the perspective coming into an environment that really started in 2016 more or less when the supply momentum began to build and it\u2019s carried now to 2017, \u201818 and we feel we will have a consistent level of deliveries going into 2019, but let me give you a little bit of color on that. So coming into 2016 obviously for a decade plus or minus prior to that, overall nationally you might have been seeing deliveries say plus or minus in the $1 billion range, that doubled in 2016 went to $2 billion. And then 2017 we had $3.5 billion, 2018 our best guess is it\u2019s going to be slightly higher say plus or minus $4 billion. And the data we track in our top 30 markets is telling us 2019 is likely to be equivalent to 2018. So you step back and you look at okay that volumes has been pronounced, Tom just talked about it relative to the impact that we see relative to occupancy. In total let\u2019s say plus or minus 400 to 500 properties a year, plus or minus 30 million square feet. And the other element that we are also tracking is a nuance that goes on with this inventory today is overall facility size is magnifying, so even if you also evaluated on a market to market basis on a per square foot or amount of inventory that\u2019s hitting markets it can be heavy. So we clearly see again part of your question developer motivation to continue to put product into some markets. The motivation is tied to again you can sell assets at still pretty low cap rates. There are a lot of funds and investors out there that want to own this type of product. And in the past, we\u2019ve talked about this ability for a developer to go out and build to a 9%, sell at a 5%, that\u2019s plus or minus an 80% margin even with some shift down, those say today they build for an 8%, but they can still sell it, may be at a 5% or today maybe a 6% cap, that\u2019s still a 33% margin. So, there\u2019s going to be developer motivation that has not eased enough to really shift down the momentum that, that is there. Now with that said, there is a little bit of different news that\u2019s somewhat encouraging because some of the most oversupplied markets that we\u2019ve seen over the last two or three years, which include Denver, Charlotte, Austin, Dallas, Houston and Tampa, we see statistically fewer deliveries going into those markets as we transition into 2019. And Jeremy the data that I'm pointing to is really what we consider pretty accurate data because these are actual construction in Motion projects. This isn\u2019t anything planned. This is \u2013 these are properties that have been launched and are in full development mode. So again, we\u2019re seeing some benefit hopefully there in those markets that have been obviously pretty hard hit. Now however, again, when you look at that holistic amount of deliveries that\u2019s likely to take place in 2019, again that we think is equal plus or minus to what we\u2019ve seen in 2018, we\u2019re still going to see markets like Portland, New York, Miami, Boston, West Palm Beach and Riley \u2013 and Raleigh, that we\u2019ll likely see slightly elevated levels of deliveries. So, we\u2019re monitoring those actively. We\u2019re not confused about the impact that this new inventory can have market-to-market. And again, we\u2019re going to continue to track and react to it and deal with I think a \u2013 an overall environment that again for 2019 is probably at the end of day somewhat similar to \u201818. Jeremy Metz : No, that\u2019s great color. Appreciate that. Switching gears just a little bit, if I look into the move-in rates, they were down about 2% in the quarter, they were down 4% in the last quarter. So, wondering if you could just talk about how those trended in the quarter so far in October, and then directionally is the right read \u2013 is a read at all on whether be from comps, easier comps and better traction on rent that we see that negative spread continue to trend down or is it too early to tell? Tom Boyle : So let me take that apart. So \u2013 thanks, Jeremy. The move-in rate as you highlighted down 2.1% in the quarter on a square footage basis compares to the 4.2% in the second quarter. So that is some improvement. I would say they\u2019re down 2.1% is pretty consistent through the quarter, so it\u2019s not as though you see a significant amount of variability by a month. We did have in the second quarter some sale activity that drove that rate in the second quarter lower, but overall down 2.1% for the quarter we continue to see in many markets a more challenged move-in environment in those markets that have had new supply impacted and in other markets where there's less supply, we have more traction and ability to hold rate or even push rate. So as Joe highlighted supply as we move forward will be impacting some markets may be less next year than it did this year and in other markets may impact it more. So, I think it's too early to call where move-in rates are going to go down the line, but there's no question will be impacted by supply in some markets. The flipside is, we continue to see pretty good demand and move-in volume in the broader macro environment is good. So the job market is great. Wage pressures are increasing and so our customers and consumers as a whole are putting more dollars in their pocket, which is helpful, and GDP is growing well. So that's all supporting the demand situation. Maybe taking that a step further just in general around our customer base, our existing tenant base is also being supported by those same demand factors and that group of customers is behaving as they have in the past if not better. So, I talked a little earlier about occupancy trends improving. One of the drivers of that is actually an even stickier existing customer base and with move-outs actually declining year-over-year. So I would say those are the pushes and pulls. I think it\u2019s too early to call where exactly we are going to end up as we move forward here, but some encouraging trends in the quarter as you highlight. Jeremy Metz : Great. Thanks for the time. Joe Russell : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, thanks for taking the time. Just going back to the existing customer base, maybe could you just talk about I know you mentioned in the 10-Q that increases were similar in 3Q as it was in the previous year. Maybe can you just provide more color in terms of what type of increases are you pushing through and sort of the reaction that you are seeing would be helpful? Tom Boyle : Sure. So the third quarter is a busy quarter for us sending out existing tenant rate increases and those were received well by our customer base, so no change there. In terms of the magnitude or strategies again no distinct changes in strategies, we are always tweaking and testing and modifying our approach there, but generally speaking, the range of increases can be reasonably large depending on the customer, the market, the dynamics, but we point you to kind of high single-digits as a ZIP code for average increases. Ronald Kamdem : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then for the contract rents, I think you touched on this a little bit, in terms of the improvement, it sounded like is it fair to say that sort of all markets improved in 3Q versus 2Q or are there some markets that were notable standouts and so forth? Tom Boyle : No, certainly this is a very local business. So even within a market you will have pockets of demand that are doing much better than others. Even in a market like LA, where you would say that\u2019s one of the strongest markets in our system, it\u2019s our largest market we see differentials within that market, with strength at San Fernando Valley, out Eastern Inland Empire as we have been able to push move-in rates there at a higher rate than in other parts of LA. So I would take it even down further, which is that this is the local business and the variability is meaningful. We are obviously driving pricing decisions on a very dynamic, but also very local unit size level by property. Ronald Kamdem : Got it. Alright. The last one from me is I just noticed that Portland was added to the list of challenged markets this quarter, maybe if you can just talk about a little bit more color on maybe what\u2019s the supply outlook, when do you see that sort of abating and so on? Joe Russell : Well, yes, Portland is a market that again we have been talking to in the last couple of quarters as one that has been positioned for an outpaced level of inventory. And again with the construction starts that have taken hold and the amount of inventory entering that market is it\u2019s certainly poised to be a challenged market in the next year or two. We have statistically a number of properties on our radar that again are examples of what I talk to, not only by quantity, there is roughly 18 properties that are coming into that market as we speak. On average they are bigger and there is more square footage that\u2019s likely to hit from a percentage on existing inventories. So, if you stack rate Portland, it\u2019s near the top of the list relative to again a market that\u2019s likely to see an elevated level of stress tied to the deliveries themselves. Now, the thing that we do have is we have a portfolio there of about 40 properties, well located. We think we have got good competitive positioning because of the locations those specific properties have in the market, some of the new developments happening in some of the outer parts of Portland. So again, as Tom mentioned, we have to evaluate as we do market-to-market, submarket-to-submarket, the individual impacts on how we react to all things relative to potential customer demand, the way we price, the way we encourage customers to stay with us. So, the good news on that front is we think we have got a good sustainable portfolio in the market and we are going to keep a close eye on the potential impact that this new inventory is going to have, not necessarily adjacent to or budding up to most of our existing product, but it\u2019s going to be in the market at large. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thanks so much. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Smedes Rose, Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you just a little bit as you look at acquisition opportunities if you have seen any changes in pricing or sort of an upward bias in interest rates and maybe your expectations around pricing going forward? Tom Boyle : Yes Smedes. I would say not a big change yet. You are correct in the potential impact that higher interest rate environment could create relative to again the opportunity tied to picking up properties that certain owners may have decided to put back in the market, because they don\u2019t meet either their own investment returns or they have got some level of stress that they want to deal with, but unfortunately, at the moment, we are not seeing a lot of that. On the fringe, we are seeing a few reverse inquiries, where owners have come into the market thinking that pro formas that were set say, 2 or 3 years ago, with pretty aggressive assumptions, not only to lease up, but rates and stability of assets, may not be happening. And you can probably imagine some of the areas that that could be taking place relative to again the pressure points tied to the supply that we are talking about, but for the most part, we really haven\u2019t seen a material shift yet. As I mentioned, there is still a lot of capital that wants to come into the sector and we, at the end of the day, really can\u2019t make sense of a lot of the valuations. When you see stabilized assets in certain markets trading at $300, $400, $500 a square foot, I mean it makes no sense to us. Now, part of the things that we have obviously shifted to and we have continued to do is look for opportunities that are rounding out presence that we have in markets that we can increase our scale. We can buy good assets say plus or minus for $100 to $110 a square foot. We have seen a number of those and that\u2019s really the theme of the amount of buying that we have done year-to-date. Now, the other thing that we have pivoted to and we feel it completely validates another capital allocation decision that we made few years ago is the investment that we are continuing to make into our development and redevelopment pipeline. So in like value we can and have been building generation 5, new state-of-the-art facilities for that same per square foot range, say, $100, $120 a square foot, these are Class A properties. They are in great locations. The lease up is going really well. If you even take a look at a market like Houston, which clearly a couple of years ago was a poster child for extreme overdevelopment, we not only had the short-term benefit of a hurricane there, but we have continued to deliver a number of properties in that market strategically. And if you look at the portfolio that we have built and delivered there and it\u2019s 9 properties say over the last 12 to 18 months, lease up is going very well and this isn\u2019t all hurricane related, it\u2019s also just related to core demand that we are seeing in submarkets of that particular market. So again, until we start seeing again some interesting opportunities, we are going to continue to be very disciplined in the way that we approach the acquisition environment. Smedes Rose : Thanks. That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe just on you talked a fair amount about development in the levels of dollar spend, I was just wondering since you are in so many markets obviously the biggest portfolio, have you seen at all a migration maybe out of some of those poster child markets that people have focused on for a while and just smaller markets as developers kind of migrate I guess to be well into MSAs or not.. Joe Russell : Yes. And I think I talked about that a few minutes ago relative to again some of those oversupplied markets that statistically we see tapering down of deliveries in 2019. I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily it\u2019s a migration, some developers leave one market to go to the next market, but again I think that\u2019s some encouraging news relative to hopefully some level of discipline that will play forward relative to slowing down some of these developments that at the end of the day maybe oversupplying certain markets. So that\u2019s encouraging. And again, we will see how through not only next year but the year after, how some of that discipline continues to play through. Smedes Rose : Great. Okay, thanks a lot. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Just first question, I guess, following up on the development topic and speaking to your development and redevelopment pipeline specifically both of which are thinning a bit here as you complete some projects and bring them online, are you seeing opportunities to backfill projects such that this inning of the pipeline is really just timing related or is the opportunity set in front of you for development shrinking? Joe Russell : Yes. Todd, I wouldn\u2019t take that it\u2019s holistically shrinking. We have continued to look for well-placed and priced land sides. And concurrent with that, we have talked about over the last few quarters also another opportunity we continue to have, which is the redevelopment or expansion of existing properties. So there has been a shift to even more investment into the redevelopment and expansion part of the portfolio. One of the things that came out of the hurricane as I mentioned a few minutes ago in Houston specifically is we ended up accelerating some of the potential rebuilds that we saw in that market because of the damage that took place on 8 or so properties. So, those have or are close to being fully completed. So there is a little bit of that and the shift of size of the development pipeline going into the next couple of years. But again, we continue to see really good opportunities to develop and create great value with the expertise that we have not only in ground-up construction, but with our team focused on expanding and enhancing existing properties. Again, in a natural way, it is shifting, where over the last couple of years, we have put a lot of new product in Dallas and Houston, for instance, but going into 2019 although Texas is still an area we feel confident about investing into, but it\u2019s more balanced. We have got properties going into Florida, Washington, Minnesota and other markets. So we are continuing to find really good opportunities. And again, we are keeping a very close eye on other factors as well, which includes construction costs and again, the things that we need to make sure that we are ticking and tying as we look at the value that we can create. But again, it continues to be a very vibrant part of our capital allocation decisions and I think we are going to see really strong value. As you look at again how again these developments stack up particularly from 2016 to today, most of them are still in really early stages of not only lease up, but stabilization. And if you look at the vintage of acquisitions or not the acquisition, excuse me, with developments that we did between 2013 and \u201815, they are plus or minus in that high single to low double-digit return range and again the population of assets that we continued to develop are still likely to generate similar levels of returns. So, it\u2019s a good business for us and again we continue to see very good opportunities around that. Todd Thomas : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I just wanted to also just circle back to the new technology system you have implemented. And I am assuming that that system is state-of-the-art in terms of utilizing data and understanding customer behavior and ultimately helping maximize revenue, how do you think your technology stacked up before the implementation of that system? I am just wondering how much room is there for an improvement and where is the biggest opportunity across operations from your standpoint? Joe Russell : ,: Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ki Bin Kim, SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just following up on Todd's question. So, the new platform, the improved platform you put in place, so where does that ultimately lead you to? Is the new system in some incremental way suggesting that you should improve or change allocation or invest in mobile versus however you use as CEO, where the different avenues that is pulling it towards? Joe Russell : Yes. Ki, I wouldn\u2019t say the system itself does that. Those are all other, again, I would say interrelated initiatives that we pulled together to again drive the tools that we uniquely can drive, because we've got a brand that resonates very effectively through even in Internet world versus one that a decade ago was tied to Yellow Pages and drive buy and call center, okay. So, we've got search engine optimization it\u2019s tied to that. We've got Internet strategies. We\u2019ve got knowledge around our customer. So, it\u2019s a very vibrant, but interrelated set of initiatives. And again, we think that we\u2019ve got great opportunities and tools, look we\u2019ll continue to improve our ability to not only fine, but retain the most valuable types of customers. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And in terms of capital allocation, you're sitting on about over $400 million of cash, you have obviously some uses for capital in the near-term and you have I think about $700 million plus of preferred \u2013 preferred equity that is redeemable next year. I\u2019m just curious about where you think the best use of capital would be next year or going forward? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, Ki Bin maybe \u2013 it\u2019s Tom, I can talk about the cash balance we have and the uses there and maybe we can talk about capital allocation as the second component of the question. We were sitting on as you highlighted about $430 million in cash, that's largely spoken for, for the most part. The $340 million of cash is required to complete our existing pipeline. So that will be spent over the next 12 months to 18 months. So that\u2019s capital allocation that Joe highlighted we think will have good returns and value for the company and we made that decision. In addition, we have about $80 million of acquisitions under contract today. So, as you add those together you get a meaningful portion of our cash balance. We\u2019re hopeful that 2019 will bring more opportunities on the acquisition front maybe cap rates do change at some point here and would allow a shift back to acquisitions from a capital allocation standpoint. We are not seeing that today, but that's certainly an opportunity, and if that were the case, we would need new financing for that. But as we look at our capital allocation today, we go back to what Joe said earlier, which is we\u2019ve seen a lot more value and being able to build Class A Public Storage designed and location picked locations at $100 to $120 a square foot compared to the acquisition environment out there that's multiples of that. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Eric Frankel, Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I posed this question to the management team at PSB last week, and maybe you could comment and looks like the split roll Prop 13 ballot initiatives will be on the 2020 ballot. I wanted to get a take on what the impact would be to your portfolio in terms of either expense growth or NOI hit at \u2013 if that passes eventually, obviously \u2013 the implementation will be \u2013 is obviously uncertain, but I\u2019d like to understand if property tax bases were brought to market, how that\u2019ll impact your portfolio? Thanks. Joe Russell : Sure. Yes, Eric, I mean, we\u2019re tracking the potential of this happening over the last literally two or three decades has come and gone many, many times. So frankly, we haven\u2019t gotten to the point where we think that at this point there's a high likelihood that it could happen, but as we get closer we\u2019ll continue to evaluate what impacts it would have. There is no question that we\u2019ve got a sizable portfolio in California. We've owned it for a number of years, so there would be a \u2013 an impact, no question. What we have no idea is what that impact could be from a size, timing and even complexity standpoint. I think that's all ahead of us relative to what to play forward. So, it's a \u2013 it's a change that we frankly have no idea if it's going to happen. So, we\u2019re going to hold off on putting a lot of potential impacts out, because we frankly just don't know what it could be yet. We\u2019ll track it. We\u2019ll see if it becomes something more realistic, we\u2019ll at that point give a little more perspective relative to potential impacts, but at this point it\u2019s too soon to tell. Eric Frankel : Okay. This \u2013 the betas to be to continued. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Joe Russell : Okay. Thanks, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya, Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Hi, yes, good morning over there in Cali. I just \u2013 I may have missed this earlier on, but could you just talk a little bit about how the acquisition outlook, whether you're starting to see cap rates moving as supply continues to be an issue, and kind of what you also kind of see now just in regards to how buyers versus sellers are interacting? Joe Russell : Yes, Tayo, I think we talked to that at some length, but at the end of the day there's really not yet been a material shift in both seller expectations and what buyer expectations are relative to create what I would say a more vibrant transaction environment. We've been very disciplined, 2018 at the end of the day going to be a light acquisition year for us and I think that's appropriate. So, we're not seeing a lot of sense that\u2019s tied to valuations that are far in excess of replacement costs. And as you may have heard, we\u2019re instead putting far more of our energies into our development pipeline, where we can create much better value. Tayo Okusanya : Great. Okay. And then also with Shurgard now being a public company, does not become an attractive source of capital for you guys? Tom Boyle : Shurgard obviously went public and we\u2019re very happy for the management team there. They hosted their first conference call yesterday. Over time, we\u2019ve had that investment since 2006. As we said we have no plan to monetize that position today, but we\u2019re believers in that business and wish the team there certainly all the best wishes as a new public company. Tayo Okusanya : Got it. Great. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller, JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Hi. Joe, just wondering, can you give us an update on the roll-out of the third-party business? Joe Russell : Sure. So, as we\u2019ve talked the last couple of quarters, Mike, we've been building the team that\u2019s focused and dedicated to build that business for us. So, Pete Panos has got now a fully rounded out team. So they are out hitting the markets hard over the last 2 or 3 months have now started participating in SSA shows, whether on a national basis or \u2013 they are really recently at the Texas SSA. So that transition to more of an outbound process has begun. We are encouraged by the level of receptivity we are getting to our platform, obviously, the advantages of coming into our system because of our brand and operational capabilities etcetera. So, so far the team has got 12 new properties signed up. We did last quarter mention a larger component of integration or new properties coming into the third-party management platform. We intentionally however made a decision to separate one portfolio that we decided was not a good fit for the program. We hadn\u2019t brought those properties into it yet, but we are very encouraged by the backlog that we have got and feel that the offering itself continues to resonate really well. It\u2019s weighted at the moment more heavily as you can imagine on pending and/or new development properties that are coming into market. So because of that, it takes some amount of time to actually pull those properties into our system once they open, but we are seeing good quality, we are seeing good ability on our part to integrate them into current operations. So, we feel very encouraged by the platform. Mike Mueller : Got it. And just separately on the expansion pipeline, I mean, what\u2019s the visibility that you have for looking out over the next few years to maintain $300 million, $350 million that you have been running at thus far? Joe Russell : It\u2019s a good question Mike. And obviously, we have got 2,400 properties. Many of them are in prime locations as candidates for this kind of development activity. So it\u2019s going to depend on a number of factors. The easiest expansion opportunities we always have is where we have either got land and/or just parking areas that we can put say a 3-plus storey facility into basically tied to or complement what\u2019s already on the ground. So, we have many of those opportunities that we have yet to touch. So, that\u2019s great and we are evaluating those. And then what can be a little bit more complicated is when you need to make the decision to actually take down parts or full existing properties. So again, on a case-by-case basis, we continue to look at those. Another factor that comes into play is zoning may or may not enable us to get the kind of density that we would like in certain locations. So there is a number of processes that we put together relative to the right candidates for this, but I am very pleased by what our real estate development team has been able to do so far and I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a vibrant part of our overall development program. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Joe Russell : You bet. Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Just a follow-up on supply, do you have sense on a 3-year rolling basis given that\u2019s how you think about the lease-ups, what percentages of your portfolio is exposed toady in 2018 and how that changes in 2019? Joe Russell : Yes. Juan, we really don\u2019t look at it on this 3-year rolling basis. I really would tie it more to what we are seeing in just raw deliveries year by year. So, as I mentioned, there is some shifting that is starting to take place in certain markets, which I named that are likely to start shifting down in deliveries and then others that are likely to taper up. So, again, it\u2019s not always to a specific property an immediate or direct impact, but we track it by our top 30 markets. And as I mentioned overall nationally, 2019 is likely to be pretty similar to 2018. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then just one more question if you wouldn\u2019t mind, what are the net straight rates you guys got on for the third quarter and the trend today so far in the fourth? Tom Boyle : So, we disclosed in the 10-Q what the per square foot rates were for the quarter. For move-in rates, we are 14.76 per square foot on an annualized basis. As we get out of the summer and into the fall seasonally we have rates that will lower. As you would expect, we are a seasonal business, where there is more demand in the spring and summer months given the used case for our product for many customers who maybe moving in the summer months between school years and things like that, college students, etcetera. So rates as we go through the fall and into the winter do decline. And so we are seeing that as you would expect. I think from a trend standpoint, if you are asking year-over-year trend I would say pretty consistent into the October month compared to the third quarter. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask you a quick follow-up question. Your on-site payroll and supervisory payroll year-to-date has been essentially flat even slightly down. Could you maybe just talk about your expectations there and how you\u2019ve been able to maintain so much, I guess, discipline there? The other industries that I follow that have a lot of, like I guess, lower skilled, maybe lower hourly cost labor, that worker is getting a real bid here? And I am just wondering how you are managing that in that kind of broader context? Joe Russell : Yes. Smedes, there is no questions that there are pressure points. We are in a very challenging employment arena. We do and have found opportunities to look for efficiencies, productivity, ways of optimizing again our employee base. I give a lot of credit to our operational teams throughout the markets, where from again both supervisory and then on an hourly basis, we continue to look for ways of optimizing use and size, and again, the burden that takes place relative to the tough environment that we are in. That said, there\u2019s no question we can\u2019t avoid and have not avoided what plays through relative to the competitive nature that\u2019s out there. So a lot of markets continue to raise wage rates that we need to deal with and we have I think a very vibrant and effective way that our HR team as well assist us with that. So we continue to look at a lot of ways of, again, optimizing and creating levels of productivity that to a degree can help balance that. Going forward it\u2019s going to continue to be a challenge and we\u2019ve got, again, a great team of leaders throughout our markets that are helping us find very sensible ways of dealing with this environment, and we\u2019re going to continue to work through that as we play forward into 2019, which again, is likely to be with everything we\u2019re seeing in today\u2019s economy very tough unemployment environment. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel, Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : Thank you. One of our follow-up questions was already asked, but maybe if you could talk about some market-specific data. It looks like your two weakest markets were Chicago and Dallas. And so Dallas is understandable that seems to be experiencing a lot of supply. But we are under the impression that Chicago is recovering and there hasn\u2019t been as much supply in the market or as much inventory coming online recently. So maybe you can just comment on some of the trends there? Thank you. Joe Russell : Yes. Sure, Eric. Yes, your point on Dallas is correct. Again, the burden of supply deliveries over the last couple of years has been particularly pronounced there. Again, that was the market that I highlighted that we hope to continue to see fewer deliveries. The statistics point to that relative to 2019, but it\u2019s still fair amount of product that needs to be absorbed. Chicago is showing some signs of improvement. Again, not as many deliveries going forward and fingers crossed, hopefully, some degree of economic recovery there as well. But we\u2019re only one quarter or two into that change, but we are hoping that there is some sustainability there and we are going to see, hopefully, fewer deliveries as well. It\u2019s stack rank is pretty low relative to deliveries going into next year. So, again, we hope the pressure eases on that front too. Eric Frankel : Is it fair to say that the big NOI hit was principally due to property tax increases there? Joe Russell : Yes, that\u2019s right. Eric Frankel : Okay, thank you. Joe Russell : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess still good morning out there. I just was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about kind of the occupancy trends sort of throughout the quarter. I know the average was down 64 to the third quarter. I guess Tom, maybe could you just walk us through how July, August, September played out? And then maybe give us some kind of look into October and where we are just about the start on November? Tom Boyle : Sure, Steve. So, in terms of occupancy throughout the quarter, as you highlighted, the average is down 60 basis points. As we have talked about on prior calls, we\u2019ve seen over the last year more move-outs toward the end of the month that leads to a tougher comparison at the period-end number compared to the middle of the month comparison on an average basis. So that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving that differential between average and period-end. The other thing is the hurricane as I highlighted before. So if you exclude the hurricane markets, the period end numbers from June to September improved sequentially compared to prior year, and would have finished down 80 basis points for the 9/30 print. As we look through July, August, September, pretty consistent occupancy throughout those months. As we got into September in particular, in Houston and then in Florida, we saw a much tougher occupancy comp. So, to give you a sense, at 9/30 occupancy in Houston was down crica 600 basis points. And as we\u2019ve moved through October, that has eased, lower a little bit, but still a meaningfully difficult occupancy comp in Houston. Across the rest of the portfolio, as I highlighted earlier, occupancy trends have been improving through the year. So, as we look at the non-hurricane impacted markets today, we\u2019re down about 40 basis points in occupancy year-over-year, again, comparing to that average 60 basis points in the third quarter and the period-end down 80. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And just to be clear, that down 40 basis points is kind of blended with the Houstons and the Floridas? Tom Boyle : No. The down 40 basis points is excluding the Houstons and the Floridas. If you include the Houstons and the Floridas, you are down 70, 80 basis points in October. Steve Sakwa : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Tom Boyle : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Holly and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you next week. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s Public Storage conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Maria, and good day everyone. Thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. I am here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by those statements. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 27, 2019, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio webcast replay of this conference call on our Web site, publicstorage.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan and thank you for joining us. We had a good quarter. And now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of [Shirley Wills] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Unidentified Analyst : So on supply, what are your latest supply outlooks for '19 and '20 and maybe just a little bit of color if markets are improving or are deteriorating? Joe Russell : No question for last two to three years, we've seen heavy amount of supply in entering many markets across United States. Statistically and in particular if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place in 2017, which was roughly over $4 billion, last year, just over $5 billion. Our view for 2019 is it's likely to be similar to 2018 deliveries. So if you just look at those three years, there is no question there has been a lot of new products that's entered the market. The totality of that is in its full view is pretty commanding, it's got 90 million square feet plus or minus 1,200 to 1,500 properties. So as we've talked over the last few quarters, we've been very transparent around the markets that we've seen the most impact from all the supply entering. Another part of the delivery and the complexion of these properties is something I talked about last quarter, which not only is it a heavy level of deliveries but on average the size of many of these properties are much bigger than they've been historically. So you've got a number of owners out in some of these markets that frankly don't have the tools or capabilities to operate them in a traditional way. So I think there is an element of both disappointment and potentially and ultimately some level of distress that could come from that as they learn and see the challenges of running these larger properties. So you also asked about, okay, how are we thinking about this shift? So there is a couple of good things here. One is first of all the markets that have seen these delivery levels many of the markets have actually absorbed the products well and we've been encouraged by that. I would point to the resiliency of the product type itself and the depth of many of those markets, consumer behavior all those things. But they're still a number of markets that continue to be impacted. Those include Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Charlotte, where again we have seen this overhang from the amount of new supply entering. And we don\u2019t see that really changing here in the near-term. The good news, however, is there is a lower level of our deliveries anticipated going in many of those markets going into 2019. Some of our better markets, again, going into 2019 include Boston, Philadelphia, LA, New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, Orlando. So we do see some additional product coming into Boston, for instance, New York. And again, we're going to keep our eyes wide open around the potential impact from that additional supply. The good news is the West Coast, outside of Portland, has been pretty resilient to supply additions. And again, we see very good metrics and just overall consumer and customer activity coming from those markets, because we have far less new competition. So with all that said we still feel like we're not out of again a heavy supply environment. But on the flipside, we continue to be encouraged by some of the things that we've seen through 2018, particularly in the fourth quarter and our feelings activities playing through as we begin 2019. Unidentified Analyst : Could you talk about Street rate trends you actually see in 4Q and maybe into 1Q as well? Joe Russell : We generally like to talk about move in rates more just given they have the real impact to our revenue as it's what customers actually rent from us. Street rates were down about 1.4% in the quarter. Overall, move-in rates were down about 3.5%. But I think that talking about moving rates really masks what happened in the fourth quarter. So as we talk about the customer behavior and trends that we saw through the quarter, you really need to talk about move-in and move-out volumes as well. So as we started the fourth quarter, we were down about 110 basis points in occupancy. We closed the quarter positive 20 basis points in occupancy. And so what happened through the fourth quarter will be solid pretty encouraging customer trends throughout the quarter of flat move in volumes year-over-year, which is the best quarter for move in volumes all year. And so how do we achieve that combination of increased advertising spend where we saw good customer response there, as well as attracting customers with that lower move-in rate that I just highlighted. In addition to that, we benefited from what is a continued trend throughout 2018 and that is consistent sticky existing customers. So lower move-ins, again, in the fourth quarter, which drove the occupancy pick-up. So, overall as we sit here today, we were encouraged by customer trends through the fourth quarter that's largely holding through the beginning part of the first quarter. And obviously, we're at the seasonally slow part of the year. So we'll need to watch how that progresses as we get into the busy season here in the next several months. Unidentified Analyst : Do you take that out continue to strength through the beginning of '19 as well, or is that just a function of maybe that actual advertising spend that you mentioned? Joe Russell : Well, let's talk a little bit about the marketing spend. So we did increase our advertising spend 29% in the quarter. The driver of that was paid search spending, because I've talked about on previous calls. We've incrementally spent more as we've gone through 2018. We've been encouraged by the customer response to that spend, what we've discovered throughout the year is that the real power of the Public Storage brand online and the reception that we're receiving to that increased spend. So we've been encouraged by that as well and will continue to use that tool as we get into 2019. So that was a fourth quarter certainly a decision to drive traffic. And we're continuing to push a little harder on that lever to drive traffic in the first quarter of 2019 as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just sticking with expenses, just looking at -- you came in full year around 3.2, obviously you are not providing guidance. But can you just talk maybe about the big buckets how we should think about maybe '19 and beyond? So I'm thinking property tax is growing in the 5s, on-site property payroll. I know you have touched on marketing spend as well. Just curious how you guys are thinking about that in '19 and beyond? Joe Russell : I would point you to the disclosure we have in our MD&A and the 10-K, which breaks out line-by-line expectations for the spend items. I think you covered it reasonably well, actually, which is that property taxes we expect to continue to increase. We expect that around 5% and obviously we will update as we go through the year. But there continues to be pressure there. On-site property manager payroll continues to be another pressure point with a very tight labor market out there. And certainly throughout 2018, we grow some efficiencies, while at the same time, being able to increase wage rates to attract the right employees at the property level. On down the list marketing spend, I just touched on. We expect to continue to spend online is our primary tool there to drive traffic. And we did see good response there and we're seeing a good here in the beginning of 2019 as well. Ronald Kamdem : And then just moving to development, maybe a two-part question. One is just maybe if you can give us some color, three versus six months ago. What you are hearing on the ground in terms of development projects, in terms of making their pro formas or delays being had? And the second piece of it is going back to the opening comments about all the supply coming on and potential distress with properties. Is that an opportunity for you guys, you see yourself down the road maybe trying to acquire some of those properties that are distressed? Thank you. Joe Russell : Yes, I mean that's been historically and we would look at calling that as the absolute right time to start getting much more aggressive. And going out and acquiring properties in an environment where there is an elevated level of stress. What comes with that is the opportunity to buy much better valuations that we think would potentially be the right time to again start accumulating and much more aggressive basis. If you look at our acquisition volume, not only for 2018 but last two or three years, we've been very disciplined around the price point at which we decided to go ahead and acquire assets. We found some good values out into the markets, but have also shied away from the frothiness that has played through. And that's still part of the market today where again there is a lot of capital that still wants to come into the sector. There are pro formas out there that we think are not reasonable. I think there is a population of owners that I talk to moment ago that are starting to see the reality very different than we expected either returns or timeline time lines ties potential, lease up and revenue stabilization on these assets. So for all those reasons, we're prepared and we've got the balance sheet ready obviously to go out and be very aggressive when more of that stress starts entering the market. Anecdotally, I would say there are a few more reverse inquiries coming to us that would include some owners out there that maybe now not meeting pro forma and are seeing some stress points from either the lenders or maybe some of the partners, or frankly are just saying wow, this is very different than I thought it was going to be and it maybe the right time to exit. So we're going to continue to track and look for those opportunities. You saw in our quarterly numbers, which is consistent really through obviously 2018, is we've got a very strong and healthy development pipeline. We think that to a property where we're putting all of our, not only internal metrics and everything that we do from studying the submarkets to submarket, we've got a very good opportunity to continue to deliver brand-new generation type product into our own ownership structure where we can build this product for say $120 a square foot, which in today's environment could trade in almost multiple higher of that. So we are very focused and we pivoted into a vibrant development program plus or minus five years ago. We see a lot of good opportunity there. We have shifted more of our efforts into our own redevelopment as well where again, we've got great locations, iconic opportunities to take very well performing assets and potentially make them even bigger or again more profitable ultimately by doing some either redevelopment or expansion. So many of the tools and capabilities that we've learned through round-up development or being applied to our redevelopment portfolio, which is again shifting from a waiting even more on that spectrum right now. Part of what's driving that, land costs are in many markets getting more expensive. There is a little bit more cost pressure relative to components of construction, whether it's steel, labor, concrete. So we're keeping a very close eye on that. But overall, we think that we will continue to deliver very good returns with the development pipeline that we have ahead of us. And then the properties that we put into the market over the last three or four years continue to be very well, they are meeting if not exceeding expectations. And we continue to think that\u2019s a very appropriate use of our own capital and we are getting very good returns from that strategy. Ronald Kamdem : My last question would be just looking at the end of period metrics, the square-foot occupancy in the annual contract rents. If I'm doing the math right that suggests that's about 1.5% revenue growth compared to the 1.2% that you did in 4Q. Just as you are sitting here today and obviously the commentary about the marketing spend being taken well. Does it feel like the business is starting to stabilize a little bit and the portfolio is absorbing some of that extra supply? Or which way are the risks skewed is basically what I'm trying to get at? Joe Russell : I'll maybe give you some color from my perspective and Tom can add to that as well. But sitting here today compared to where we were a year ago, I would say that yes, we have an outlook that shifted to be more encouraged around many of the things that we are seeing, which include again the resiliency in the sector of large products types and the way as we know it behaves from our lease up fill-ups standpoint, we are seeing good resiliency. And given many of the things that we continued to use that are unique to us for 2018, we saw some good traction, particularly the second half of the year. So sitting here today, we feel like we are in a better place. Now, going into moving in busy season, we will see how that plays through. We are just a few weeks from that. But all things considered, we feel like we are in a better place going into that than we were a year ago. And we will continue to see and figure out how to maneuver around the supply that continues to come in the markets as well. So it's little bit of a two-edged sword. But all things considered, we are on-balance and we are more encouraged. Tom Boyle : I would add a couple of things to that. One is that you have to look back several years as you think about where we were at the beginning of the development cycle of occupancies north of 95%. You certainly watched in the last several years, some of that occupancy given up and some of the supply impacted market. And as we look at those markets today, we have been impacted in some areas. We expect to be impacted in others. And so there is more of a put and take around markets where we are seeing some improvement and markets where we are seeing deterioration based on that new supply. I think your question around the period end math, you did the math right. The 1.3% and 0.2% gives you 1.5% aggregate contract rent as we go into 2019. As we look at trends, since January 1st as I highlighted earlier on the call, pretty consistent. So occupancy trends have been consistent with that time period or up about 30 basis points in occupancy today. And contract rent continues to be impacted by rent roll down and existing tenant rate increases. But I think that period end math you did is right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Just first question, I guess following up on that a little bit. I was just curious on the 10-K that was filed this morning, you disclosed the move-in and move-out spread was negative 16%. So that's the widest during the cycle. And Tom you noted that move-in rates were lower year-over-year by 3.5%. Any sense where we are in the cycle, whether you may see some stabilization in pricing for new customers? And then can you talk about how much that spread contributes to revenue growth and how we should think about that spread? Joe Russell : So let me take that by piece-by-piece. So we did see, as I highlighted earlier in the call, rental rates for move-in customers to be down 3.5%. That move-in move-out spread that you highlighted, call it 16% did deteriorate that was a strategy to drive the move-in volume that we achieved during the quarter. And so it's hard to talk about rate without volumes, because I talked about the move-in volume that we achieved was the best move-in volume that we achieved throughout 2018. And so it's really a combination of both of those factors. But certainly, there is rental rate pressure in many of the markets that Joe highlighted having been impacted by new supply. We're going to see some new markets enter that list and I'm sure that we will see some rental rate impact in those markets as we get to 2019. So I think the environment there remains a challenging one. But as I've said earlier, the flipside of that is our existing tenant base continues to perform very well. And move outs were down on a volume basis and those sticky customers afford us the ability to send rental rate increases as we get through the busy months here, and so we've been encouraged by those trends. And I think those customers are supported by the macro environment, wage growth, the employment market, things like that are all contributing to the performance and behavior of our existing tenant base. Todd Thomas : And so you talk about obviously the business is seasonal and you mentioned that you drove higher move-in storing the quarter. And the fourth quarter represented on a square footage basis just under 24% of the full year move-ins, which is up 100 basis points versus the prior year for the fourth quarter. So it seems like the fourth quarter this year there was a lot less seasonality than in prior years and you talk about the marketing spend and the positive effect it had on move-ins. Was that in or was there anything more broadly that led to the higher fourth quarter rental activity that you can point to? Joe Russell : I think you summarized it pretty well, a number of factors. And as I said, we are encouraged by the traffic we saw in our stores and we'll see where we get to during the busy season, which will be the real litmus test as we get through 2019. And we see much more volume through the summer months and it will have a big impact on our 2019 performance. So more to come there. Todd Thomas : Have you seen some less seasonality starting to materialize in recent quarters, or is this the first quarter where you've seen that? Joe Russell : I think we continue to see seasonality in the business. There is nothing different about the fourth quarter this year versus prior years from a seasonality standpoint. It was different, customer use storage for different reasons through different times of the year. You don't have the college students in the fourth quarter. You don't have folks that are moving to get into a new school district in the summer, in the fall. So there is going to be seasonality and we continue to expect that 2019 will be no different there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to go back to on the expense side, you mentioned also in the 10-K that you had reduced hours on site in order to help offset some of the wage increases. And I was wondering if there is more to go there? Or if you are able to maybe put in more automation perhaps it eliminates the need for employees or how you think about that part of the business? Joe Russell : Smedes, what we did in 2017 was put into all of our properties in our Web Champ 2 system, which we talked about some degree through 2018. So full year, we had 2018 Web Champ 2 which again is our customer interface system throughout the entire organization. There is no question based on its design, we were able to optimize labor hours along with training. It's a much more intuitive system, so new employees were able to come into the company on a much more efficient training program. So we saw some good traction there. And I would say we've got a lot of that work through this system. So there may not be going into 2019 the same level of additional benefit. But the great news is the system itself continues to evolve from a functionality standpoint and efficiency standpoint. It's all built around making the customer experience that much more efficient and timely coupled with again easier to learn use and adapt by new employees. So a lot of that traction I think went through the system in 2018. The thing that we will see, which is something Tom has already talked about is the price pressure we are seeing in labor overall is the toughest employment arena that we have seen in well over a decade. So we are looking at many ways to optimize our labor force, the size of it. But at the end of the day, many of our properties fundamentally need that key single person each and every day to run a property. And we really can't cut beyond that until we are at a point where we can do something as forward thinking as what you're asking is and we actually run properties with our people. So we are not at that point yet. It's an interesting concept. But that\u2019s something clearly downstream that we will have to take a fair amount of time to figure out how to put any of those opportunities into the system. Smedes Rose : The other thing I just wanted to ask, you also mentioned in the 10-K there were no plans to use joint venture financing or sales of properties as a source of capital. But just wondering, I mean it seems -- we keep hearing that pricing has been very sticky and relatively high or low cap rates. And is there not an opportunity maybe to sell more mature properties at very strong pricing and retain management contracts from them? Or is that just something that you would be interested in doing to jump start the third-party platform? Joe Russell : Well, I don't think that\u2019s necessary component to jumpstart our third-party platform. I would just tell you from a strategic standpoint, I mean that\u2019s something that we would continue to evaluate as we have in the past. But again that\u2019s not -- I would am evolving strategy. For the most part, we're very pleased with the size and the scale and ownership structure that we have with the full portfolio and we'll continue to consider all alternatives as they arise. But no, I wouldn't -- I would point you that direction right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : So I think you mentioned the average length of stay increasing. Can we talk about like what kind of magnitude you're talking about and maybe if we can answer that differently? What percent of your customers have been there for over a year and how's that trend over the past couple years? Joe Russell : What we saw and what specifically we highlighted in the 10-K was the increased length of stay from some of the move-ins that we saw through 2018. So we saw some good traction there. Overall, the entire portfolio, the metrics are pretty consistent with what we've talked about in the past, so a little under 60% of our customers are with us for a year. As we highlighted in the K, we've seen some modest improvement to those metrics. But overall, not a fee change at this point but encouraging trends. Ki Bin Kim : And 60% of customers have been their over year, and I'm assuming that\u2019s a similar pool for the eligible customers to get a rent increase letter. But what percent of that 60% when the once they get a letter actually end up rolling down? And I know it depend on timeframe, so maybe within three months we're getting a letter or four months, I'm not sure what the cut off is, what your cut off is. But just trying to get a sense on what the roll down and how meaningful that can be? Joe Russell : Ki Bin, I'm not understanding the question. The roll down, what roll down are you talking about with existing tenants? Ki Bin Kim : So my question is basically if 60% of customers, in theory, get a rent increase letter. What percent of that 60% actually ends up leaving within call it four months or so that might\u2026 Joe Russell : It's around the efficacy of the existing tenant rate increase program, but that's metrics that we watch very closely. And obviously we seek to optimize the rental income that we can charge our customers based on many factors. And certainly, the propensity to vacate thereafter is a key component to that analysis. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : Just a broad question, I noticed that of course your 10-K, your market share and the market share of the top five operators of 7% and 15% respectively, hasn't changed over the year. Obviously, there's been a lot more storage volume. Do you have on hand how much what those percentages look like with third-party management and the professionalization of that business? And what that market share is if you include that? Joe Russell : I don't have that on hand. It's something that we can get some industry data and talk about offline. But I don't have that in front of me. Eric Frankel : Do you think it increased or stayed the same versus last year, the third-party management of the top five operators versus all of the U.S. stock? Joe Russell : I don't know. We have to look at that data. I don't have it in front of me. Eric Frankel : Do you guys have any targets of -- obviously you're fairly sensitive to price and you think that acquisitions are still a little bit pricey today. Do you guys have a goal or target of what you think your market share should be overtime? Joe Russell : You mean, on a per market basis? Eric Frankel : Yes, per market and nationally, sure. Joe Russell : Well, no. I mean, it's never that scientific that it's best to have one number versus another. There's no question -- in almost every market internationally, we have commanding market share. And we see inherent benefits whether that share is 15% or 20% or 25% for instance. So for the most part, more share is better. One of the things that we continually look for are opportunities through our ownership and now through our third party management platform to grow that scale. And the scale come through and can be very advantageous in a number ways, not only physical presence but obviously all the tools that we're using in today's world relative to our marketing tactics for the Internet, et cetera. So we constantly look for ways to optimize our share, let's put it that way. But we do enjoy the fact that the largest operator by a meaningful factor and crossing that stage and literally in almost every metropolitan market, we see a lot of inherent benefits to that. Eric Frankel : And related to market share and controlling more and more properties. Your third party management business I guess 10-K disclosed you manage 33 third-party stores. Is that correct? Joe Russell : Well, no. Today, in the program, we have 50, okay. So if you look at our program, we literally announced our entr\u00e9e into third party management business exactly a year ago. And we literally started from zero. So when we announced it a year-ago, we did not have a team in place. We had designated a senior leader, being Pete Panos, to basically build the business from the ground up. And he now has team that\u2019s fully in place, have been working on that diligently over the last 12 months. So we're very pleased with the traction that we're seeing from our entr\u00e9e into the business. We're seeing good receptivity to the components of our offering, which include obviously the brand itself, our operational capabilities, the ability to be part of our all of our initiatives tied to our marketing prowess, et cetera. And again, a very competitive fee, which also include sharing insurance revenue. So the offering is very compelling. We've got a backlog that continues to build on. Pete and his team are now out doing much more outbound efforts. So what has taken place with our entr\u00e9e into the business, which I think is similar maybe to others overtime is it does take a number of quarters to get pipeline build, because many of the properties that are typically coming to these programs are being built. So, we have a healthy backlog that includes a number of those properties in it as well. We have a number of properties that have been in place that have decided to come into our platform versus either be running the facilities themselves or coming up another third party platform. So we see a lot of good traction there and we'll continue to see good opportunities going into this year. Eric Frankel : And I have probably have a few more questions. I'll just ask last one just related to Shurgard Europe. I guess after the offering, you now own 35% stake in the company. Do you foresee that increasing or decreasing or staying the same over time depending on how fast they grow? Joe Russell : Well, the thing I would comment to Eric and you've use that an example, our commitment and sponsorship of PSP, I would say we have a same view of Shurgard. We think the teams very capable. I think IPO went really well. They've worked really hard over last decade optimizing their portfolio, their full capabilities. We think they have got a great opportunity and platform to go forward on their own. And with that we continue to be a key sponsor of their efforts and we will continue to again be committed to the entity as a whole. So from a specific percentage standpoint really I'm not going to talk to that. But I'll just tell you that we plan to have a very strong endorsement sponsorship of the entity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Just a quick financing question, you called the series Y preferred. Just curious what are the plans to either finance that, replace it, looking at debt, looking at other preferreds, et cetera? Joe Russell : We did issue the redemption notice and we will redeem the series Y 6 and 38 preferred at the end of March. That is a 6 and 38s coupon. So we view that as a good capital allocation decision to redeem those. We have many tools at our disposal. The financing market is pretty attractive right now, both preferred as well as the debt market. And we finished the year with $360 million in cash. So lots of tools to address that $285 million redemption at the end of the quarter, and the financing markets are good. Mike Mueller : But no bias at this point in terms of debt or preferred? Joe Russell : No. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Tom, on the predicted revenue growth metric, you said in prior calls that average occupancy is a better way to look at it and using period end occupancy. Has that view changed? And the reason I asked is because using period end occupancy implied worse revenue growth for the following quarter than using average occupancy in the past three earnings releases? Tom Boyle : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. We had talked and really shifted to talking about average is being probably a better metric as we went through 2018. And the reason for that was some shifting consumer trends as we looked at vacate trends throughout the month. We have now lapped that. And so the period end trend, particularly for the fourth quarter given the fact that we increased occupancy on a year-over-year basis throughout the quarter, period end is a better metric to look at an average. So short answer is we have lapped that differential. Period end is as close to 2019 as you are going to get. So I would point you to that as an indicator to look towards. Jonathan Hughes : And could you just remind us what were changing the preferences again? Tom Boyle : We just saw customers electing to vacate more towards the end of the months. And we've talked about there was something that we like that allowed us to get more inventory back before the busy part of the month where we moving a lot of customers at the end of the month and getting into following. So that was another encouraging customer behavior change we saw through 2018. Jonathan Hughes : And you don't think that will continue this year? Tom Boyle : It will. It's just that it happened in 2018, so we've lapped it. Jonathan Hughes : And then looking at the CapEx spend that was about $140 million last year, actually a bit below guidance. But I understand some might have gotten shifted into 2019. But the 2019 CapEx spend guidance of $200 million suggests a 40% increase this year. Can you just give us some color on what's driving that increase? Joe Russell : So it's primarily driven by an initiative that we did a lot of testing on through 2018 that includes a number of enhancements that we're going to be delivering to our existing product. So through our development program over the last few years, we've come up with what we've labeled our generation five products that has a number of components and elements that we think are really well suited to go back to our existing assets. And basically use it as an opportunity to do a refresh of the physical part of the assets, as well as looking at some opportunities to improve from a cost and efficiency standpoint, things like utilities, et cetera. So it includes simple things like paint, which again we've learned overtime and done a lot of testing that using a dominant amount orange plays well, not only for curb appeal but it lines up with a lot of things that we do on our online efforts, simple signage, just some of the office environments, retooling them to make them much more customer oriented. We have now a paperless environment with webcam too. So we need fewer filing cabinets and with that can use office space in a very different and more efficient way. And then to the efficiency side of the equation, we're doing things like internal and external LED, upgrading landscaping. So we have less water usage. We are looking at solar. So we're doing some testing on solar as we speak. So there's a number of, I think, meaningful investments that you're going to see as we use really the enhanced capabilities that we've seen and good reaction to our generation five product as we deliver that new product in many markets across United States now into our existing portfolio. So this year, we're likely to spend plus or minus about $100 million on that effort. It's going to launch in many parts of the West Coast. So when you're out here towards the end of the year, for instance at NAREIT, we may have an opportunity to actually display and show some of that while a number of you are in town. So we're excited about what traction that we're getting from this. We're getting very good reaction from customers and employees. And we're really excited about the overall benefits we're going to see in existing portfolio. Eric Frankel : And then on the last one on the 383 stores and 31 million square feet that are outside of the same-store pool. I realized a large portion of that's not stabilized. But how much do you expect to roll into the same-store pool this year? Joe Russell : We'll look at the number of properties within that pool that will be stabilized as of the January 1, 2017 and it would be appropriate to roll in. And when we make that determination, it will be based on both their occupancy as well as the rental rate and revenue growth associated with those properties, as well as cost of operations. So our philosophy is to ensure that those properties that are added are stabilized versus the other properties within the market and within the market with those properties are. I would expect that many of our 2016 acquisitions, as well as some of our 2013 and 2015 developments will roll into the same-store pool. They will be stabilized when we roll them in. So we won't be talking about any revenue benefits associated with rolling those properties in given the fact that they are stabilized when they are going in. And there is probably some expansions as well in the 2013 and 2015 period that are in the other categories that will be rolled in. As well as any other category, there are properties impacted by natural disasters, damage, et cetera that we'll evaluate. So I don't have a number for you at this point, but certainly we'll be prepared to talk about that for the first quarter call. Operator : And thank you ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I would now like turn the floor back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Maria. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to connecting with you in the coming weeks and months. Have a nice day.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Laurie. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the first quarter of 2019 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements, other than statements of historical fact included on this call, are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statement. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in yesterday's earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 2, 2019, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Great. Thanks, Ryan. And thank you all for joining us. We had a good quarter, and I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shirley Wu of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shirley Wu : Hey, good after, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So my first question is in regards to revenue growth. Over the last few quarters, you've ranged between $1.2 million to $1.5 million of revenue growth. And your period end data would suggest that revenues stay in that range for 2Q. So it seems like things have been fairly steady in the midst of all this new supply. And given the resilience of demand, how you feel revenue is going to play out in '19? And any thoughts on when revenues could drop? Tom Boyle : Great. Thanks, Shirley. I can comment on that. I think you gave a pretty good summary of what our historical revenue growth has been over previous quarters, and you do point to the period-end occupancy and contract rent growth which do suggest we ended the quarter in a place where contract rents would be growing at the start of April at a similar level. So I think -- we've been encouraged by customer trends like we spoke about on our last call, really a combination of a tougher move environment, balanced really by continued good performance by existing tenant base. In our existing tenants, we see move-outs down and length of stay modestly increasing and there are all being supported by a strong labor market out there in the broader macro economy. So we've seen good operating trends in consistent with what we discussed on our last call, reasonably a steady contract rent growth and occupancy through the quarter. Shirley Wu : Got it. Tom Boyle : Terms of where we go from here, we're obviously at the end of the first quarter. We're about to enter into our seasonally busy move-in time as we get into May and June and that'll be a big determinant overall 2019 revenue trends and we'll certainly update you on those trends on our next quarterly call. Joe Russell : Shirley, I'd just add the other thing that we've been seeing and we're pleased to see is, we're maneuvering through and navigating through what continues to be commanding arena of new supply in certain markets, some of that's been shifting out of markets that have been more heavily burdened say over the last two or three years. We still got other markets ahead of us that are likely to see somewhat similar impact going into '19 and 2020. But again to Tom's point, we're feeling better and we like what we're seeing relative to the traction and the capabilities that we're putting into many parts of the business to maneuver through this environment. Shirley Wu : Okay. So moving to street rates. How does 1Q trended and even into 2Q and also you're moving rates as well? Tom Boyle : Great. So, as you know, we've spoken on in previous calls, we don't tend to watch street rates too closely. Street rates were actually up a little over 1% in the quarter but we focused on move-in rates, as they're actually the rates that customers will be paying us. Move-in rates as we disclosed in our 10-Q last night were down for the quarter, down 1%. That's the best move-in rate performance we've seen in some time. And we did see moving volume down modestly in the quarter, but again offset by move-out volumes being down as well, In terms of rent roll down, this is seasonally one of the bigger rent roll down quarters given the slower move-in season and the fact that folks have moved in and higher rates through the summer. And so we did continue to see rent roll down in the quarter which deteriorated modestly, but again, one of the better performances in rent roll down deceleration. Shirley Wu : Got it. So would you say, move-in rates have persisted, not negative 1% into April as well? Tom Boyle : Yes, we've seen consistent trends in April. And that's really a balance of all the markets in which we have operations. So if you look at certain markets like an LA on the West Coast to some of our stronger East Coast markets, which have good positive move-in rent performance. And then as Joe highlighted, the markets we're being impacted by new supply. We do see a negative move-in rates continuing into 2019. So markets like Houston which were lapping hurricane benefit in prior year, I would lump into that group as well. Shirley Wu : Got it. Thanks for the color, guys. Joe Russell : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Your question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys. Joe, you touched on navigating supply just a minute ago, but can you just give your broader views on supply here as we look into 2019 and any early read on 2020? And whether those views have changed or how they've changed at all as we've moved a little further into the year? Joe Russell : Yes, sure, Jeremy. I would say there's really no change on what, again, our outlook is from even 60 days ago from our last call. So everything we're tracking points 2019 to be yet again another pretty commanding year of deliveries, plus or minus from that $5 billion range, say 400 to 500 properties, plus or minus 30 million square feet. So the one thing as I noted a few minutes ago, it is shifting somewhat. So if it's encouraging at all, which we like to see fewer deliveries were taking place in Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Tampa, for instance. So there has been a pullback there, that's good news, But some developers are starting to get more active in Portland, Boston, Seattle Miami and New York. So we're keeping a close eye on any residual impact that the supply is likely to have this year and going into next year. The same drivers are out there that has fueled this level of supply over the last two or three years in particular, which is a lot of new entrants are still coming into the sector. You've got developers that like the potential yields are likely to derive from new development and fundings out there. So we're keeping a close eye on it. We're looking at 2020 as potentially a year that things could start shifting down, but again, we've got a track it and see what's at hand. I'll tell you, and maybe even the shift a little bit into how that's affecting the acquisition environment. There are a number of conversations that are becoming more pronounced which are laced around the theme of I want out. Now again, not out because it's a stressful situation or it's one that necessarily is commanding that decision at a level that I've got to get out, but it's a realization that maybe returns aren't going to be met. They may have some lender pressure, maybe expectations from a revenue performance standpoint, aren't there. So that is a residual effect and potentially a good thing that we're going to continue to see. So if you even look at -- as you saw through the first quarter and what we've reported relative to what we have under contract, we've now even through the early part of this year, exceeded the acquisition volume we didn't in all 2018, and there are some interesting things as part of that collection of acquisitions. One for instance is, for the first time in several years, we have a property that we're acquiring out of bankruptcy. So I've talked about that a little bit over the last few quarters, meaning that we think some of that kind of acquisition opportunity could surface and we've got one again under contract. We bought a portfolio in the first quarter, nine properties, great assets, long term ownership and the deal came to us on an off-market basis, but again the owners decided it was for them the right time to exit the sector entirely. And it was a good negotiation, meaning it was a deal, it was fair priced. It wasn't one that they looked at was one that had to meet or get a top level evaluation, but it was a deal they wanted to do on a very efficient and clean basis and we were an ideal candidate to do that. So there's more of that in the mix as we speak and we're encouraged by that. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Jeremy Metz : And is something that driving just maybe the price per pound here we're seeing just in terms of some of the pipeline, I mean, just as looking at the market mix, it wouldn't appear those are high-cost markets like say in New York, but it looks like some of the stuff you have on your contract it would equate to around the $100, call it $60 or $70 a foot. I mean, I know replacement cost is core to your buying philosophy. So is any of that factoring into that? Joe Russell : Well, little of the mix in -- what on average is driving that a little higher than maybe what you've seen us do in a few prior quarters is, some of our acquisitions in the pipeline right now are in more urban markets and higher finished assets, newer that we think not only are very well located but very hard to duplicate. Again with the same theme, that owners are coming to us and saying, OK, we may not meet or exceed the type of returns we expected two or three years ago when we put these properties into development. They're not by any means failed assets, but again actual expectations are not being met. So we've got a few of those in our pipeline right now under contract that are extremely well located great assets. A handful of them might be a little bit higher on average as you've seen us do in some of the other markets that we bought assets, but we still feel great replacement cost deals, we're going to get various good returns. And again, we hope to see more of that kind of activity throughout this year. Jeremy Metz : Definitely appreciate that. Last one from a, I was just wondering if you could give a quick update on your third-party management initiative and on that front, are you actually seeing any one out there jumping platforms between the bigger operators who do third-party? I know historically that I really haven't heard much of that happening, but have you seen any of that at least on the margin? Joe Russell : So in the quarter, we signed 11 properties into the platform. Our backlog continues to grow. It's heavily weighted by development deals that will take a number of quarters to actually come to completion and be pulled directly into the program itself. We're seeing and learning a lot of interesting things through the platform. And yes, I would tell you some of that includes, which I don't think at the end of day as may be new to the business, but there are certain owners that do change flags. So whether they're coming to us through either private or a another public third-party platform. We are seeing some of that, but I wouldn't tell you that the dominant part of the activity in our backlog, it's still highly correlated to deals that are in various forms of development. But we like what we see, relative to the type of assets that are coming to us. We've actually at the end of the day, passed on as many properties as we've decided to pull in to the platform for a moment for a number of reasons. So I think we've got the ability to continue to be particularly cautious about what markets that some of these assets come to us and whether or not we choose to go into those or other factors, but again we feel like over time, we'll be able to grow the scale of business and keep good momentum around it itself. So that's where we stand as we speak. Jeremy Metz : Great. Thanks for the time Tom Boyle : .You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just -- I wanted to ask you just a little bit about marketing expenses in the quarter, second quarter pretty big increases year-over-year. Do you expect that pace to kind of continue through the balance of the year? And I guess along with that, it sounds like you are seeing some stabilization throughout your system a little bit. And I mean, do you attribute it to maybe changes in the way that you're marketing on the Internet versus other ways? Or maybe just some color around that? Tom Boyle : Sure. So let me take that in some different components. So the marketing spend that we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent rate of increase from the fourth quarter. And as we discussed last time, we did that in the fourth quarter, really throughout 2018 and increased our spend as we saw good demand response online and a great reaction to our brand and in online paid search that's combined with a more competitive environment, on paid search. As you'd expect in -- many markets impacted by new supply, the cost of acquiring customers is increasing as that supply is getting absorbed and so there is some -- some market cost per click increases in there as well. Ultimately, our decision-making around that is very dynamic based on keywords and local market dynamics and traffic. So I'm not going to call a rate of increase for the rest of the year, but it's a tool that we are seeing good returns on today and we're continuing as we get into the second quarter to use that tool. The second part of your question was, is that benefiting the overall level of move-in activity? And certainly the answer to that is yes, we do like the demand response we're seeing from that channel, but we're using a combination of advertising rates which again, our rates were down about 1% for move-ins for the quarter and promotions to drive traffic to our stores. In terms of the third component of your question which was around, is it contributing to stabilization of the portfolio in aggregate? I guess, I would say, we're seeing good trends in advertising helping move-ins, but move-ins remain challenging in many markets and so that's where our increased spend is concentrated and other markets where move-in trends are quite good and healthy. In terms of the stabilization point, we have seen some good trends in some of the early markets that were hit by new supply. So you'll see markets like Washington DC or Chicago improving. DC is up 180 basis points in occupancy for us year-over-year, Chicago is up 160 basis points. So we are seeing some improved trends there. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to circle back to development it looks -- you're development and expansion pipeline decreased specifically and I know you delivered a few stores in the quarter, but how is the activity looking to backfill that pipeline is Public's pipeline slowing down here? Or is it just more timing related? Joe Russell : Yes, Todd, first of all, we had an active Q1. So a lot of the pipeline delivered in the quarter, we had about $137 million deliveries for new builds. But what really drove the volume was a number of redevelopments heavily tied to the remaining scrape and rebuilt's we did and Houston specifically. So we had an elevated level of first quarter volume. So to a degree, some of that impacted the pipeline, the pipeline did shift down close to $100 million or so, but that can ebb and flow. I wouldn't take that as an indication that overall we've intentionally taper that down just one or two quarter basis, we're seeing a lot of good continued potential activity out there. It has shifted intentionally more to our redevelopment activity, where we're taking existing properties and putting a lot of the attributes from what we call our Gen 5 new product into properties that are extremely well located where we can expand and increase not only performance, but scale in certain markets, where otherwise, you'd never be able to get to those great land sites. So we see continued -- very active activity on that front. Today about 60 plus percent of our development pipeline is tied to that, and the teams are out looking for land sites in a variety of different markets. In some markets, lands becoming more expensive, so we're keeping a close eye on the impact to that. The other thing that is happening is the time to entitle seems to be and certainly a number of markets, getting more commanding. Now the reverse of that which kind of ties to some of the impact with some of the either developers or entrants that have come into the market over last two or three years. We are getting reverse inquiries more than we've seen recently for close to our fully entitled land sites. So again, we've got a healthy collection of different opportunities there, and the team's every bit is focused on out driving that kind of opportunity and we continue to see very good returns from our investments in the development pipeline. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then -- and Tom you mentioned the cost to acquire a customer continues to rise, can you share with us what that cost is today and maybe discuss how that's trended? Tom Boyle : Sure. The cost has modestly increased and certainly the advertising spend is a component of another component. You can track in our disclosures and 10-Q is the promotional discounts that really comes in the form of the $1 for the first month rent for Public Storage, which is a great way to drive traffic to our stores, those are the two large components of customer acquisition costs. So you can take a look at those that are in our filings. Todd Thomas : Okay, that's fine. And then just lastly, can you just talk about your plans to run. I think what previously was -- the Memorial Day sale this month in May, whether you're planning to and how discounting and promotions are sort of shaping up for the busy season in general? Tom Boyle : Sure. So we typically do run some sales as we go through the summer months and we've seen good returns on that in the past. It's something that we'll dynamically assess as we go through the quarter and we'll update you as to where we go. In terms of promotional trends, you could see promotional dollars were down in the quarter. That's really driven by volume and rate decrease is not a strategy change there. So we continue to use that dollar special to drive traffic into our stores. I would expect consistent strategies this year as last year, but obviously if anything changes, we'll let you know. Todd Thomas : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Ronald Camden : Hey, if I go back to the marketing spend, just curious, obviously it's pretty local. But is there any kind of high level discernible themes in terms of where the dollars are going. So said another way, is it more West Coast markets versus East Coast maybe more supply challenge or is sort of increased spend all across the board and hard to pick out? Tom Boyle : Sure. In terms of where it's located geographically, the increase in spend is across the board. I think there are certain markets, as I highlighted that spend is more -- increased more than others and that's really driven by the competitive dynamic as customers are competed for on Google and other online platforms. So the overall spend costs are higher across the board, but it is concentrated in markets where the competitive dynamics are more intense. Ronald Camden : Great. The other question was, just, I think I believe there was a website refresh for the Company set to be [indiscernible] this quarter. I think the idea was hopefully it would kind of tie in to your ability to market online. Maybe can you give us an update on that and how that's been received and what you're seeing there Joe Russell : Sure, Ronald. I'll start and Tom can add to this too. So, yes, we delivered what I would label our generation, our fifth generation website in the first quarter. So it's a project that has gone through a variety of different testing et cetera as we rolled it out through the entire platform. So we're pleased thus far by what we're seeing, it's going to give us additional capabilities that we've been able to add, not from a need standpoint but from an opportunity standpoint. All indications are the tool that's going to provide us are going to be quite commanding in a number of ways. So we're anxious to continue to roll those out as we go through the rest of this year and Tom if you can give additional color on it. Tom Boyle : Yes, I think we covered well Joe, I think it's built to be mobile centric as customers continue to move to transact with us on their phones as we continue to see that trend play out and really something that has played out over the last decade and so you'll see that as you pull up the new public storage.com but we're pleased with it and team worked hard on it and we're happy to have it delivered in the first quarter. Ronald Camden : Yes, my last question was that -- I think you made some interesting comments about sort of the -- the environment and opportunities out there. Just curious on -- just thinking about lease-up and lease-up times. Obviously, you're in the market looking at properties and you've got a few that's delivered, how does that -- how are you guys thinking about that, how has that trended over the last year or so? When you're running the pro forma are you assuming no longer lease-up times. And just, what can you quantify that for us. Thank you. Joe Russell : Yes, I wouldn't say there's been any shifts at all. I mean, again, you go back to the fundamental way that a lease-up typically happen on a property and, frankly, it can range from anywhere from two to three years on an average basis, so not really seeing any different timeframes tied to that. In certain markets where supply maybe more pronounced, you may have elongated lease-up or some impact from that then alternatively, some markets that do have a fair amount of supply are still doing quite well because there's an inherent needed in the market itself maybe under served in that frankly is the reason why we chose the developer specific asset there in the first place. And then maybe -- another part of the mix that we have out there is -- that we've got other assets that are clearly well ahead of our expectations and we're seeing very good traction in a number of properties that are, again ahead from that standpoint as well. The thing that is a natural part of our business as a whole is it not only is it a factor of lease-up, but then it's the maturity of the lease. It's the lease property -- property itself. And what I mean by that, the inventory leases that are at hand take a fair amount of time to mature and stabilized, because you're going to see good growth, and you're going to see good factors tied to that but that time needs to mature. So that again, you've got a highly stabilized asset and you're able to evaluate its ultimate success. Tom Boyle : This is Tom, you can see that in our 2013 to 2015 development vintages that -- as Joe highlighted, they leased-up well, and they continue to stabilize and so you can see that the growth in the quarter, up 10% or 11% for that group as it continues to season and we certainly provide that disclosure, so you can evaluate the performance of those stores as well as the other developments and expansions vintages that we've been active in delivering. Ronald Camden : Helpful. That's all from me. Thank you so much. Joe Russell : Thanks, Ronald. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning out there. I guess number my operating questions have been asked, but I just wanted to touch on the balance sheet quickly. Tom I mean, obviously you guys recently did a longer-term bond issuance and historically you've used preferreds to kind of fund the Company. And just trying to get a update on sort of your thought process there. You do have a couple of preferred issuances that are callable later this year. And I'm just kind of wondering what your thought processes longer-term about using more debt? Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Steve. So we have issued both preferred and bonds throughout the year. We continue to remain committed to both markets as good financing tools. As we've talked about in the past, the preferred market is a great long-term permanent source of capital with lots of great features including the call feature and the permanent life. With our balance sheet, we also have the ability to add incremental long-term debt to finance our external growth pipelines, both the acquisition activity, as well as the development pipeline. So we'll look to use both sources of capital going forward. You highlighted that we do have some callable preferreds outstanding. We also have some new callable preferred later in the year that we'll evaluate. In the month of March, we did execute a preferred financing as well as a redemption that lowered our aggregate preferred cost of 5.3% which is a continued improvement. So it's a long-winded way of saying, we like both markets and the balance sheet is in great shape here today with -- if you deduct the 120 million-ish of acquisitions under contract from the $220 million of cash we had at year-end and a pro forma for the $500 million bond issuance, we're sitting on about $600 million in cash today, which gives us good liquidity to fund external growth as we get through the rest of the year. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then I guess just second question about real estate taxes. I know in the MD&A section here, the 10-Q you sort of talked about real estate taxes staying relatively consistent up kind of about 5%. But are you just seeing any relief in any markets, and as you kind of look forward when might that start to tail off a bit? Joe Russell : Relief is not what I would consider what we're seeing in real estate taxes today. So we do expect property taxes to grow around 5% this year. If you look back over prior years that's reasonably consistent with what we've seen. I do think that there is an element of catch-up to cash flow earlier in the cycle associated with real estate values that we're seeing. And so in certain markets, could we see a benefit going forward as incomes have maybe come down in some of our more supply impacted markets. It's certainly possible, but we're not seeing that in any real quantity at this point. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hong Jiang from JP Morgan. Hong Jiang : Hi, guys. Just another question on the marketing expense. This is the third quarter that you started ramping up your marketing spend, are you seeing your competitors respond at all by increasing their marketing spend maybe dropping up the cost -- cost for the same impressions at all? Tom Boyle : Yes. So I touched on this a little bit. There is no question that the overall Internet paid search environment continues to get more competitive. So we're certainly part of that as we increase our spending and like what we've seen and others are doing something similar. So the competitive environment is driving cost per click up year-over-year. But like I said earlier, we're seeing good demand response for our brand term online and we've continued to push there and like what we're seeing Hong Jiang : Would you know roughly how much the cost per click has gone up for -- gone up for you guys? Joe Russell : Cost per click is up in the double digits. Hong Jiang : Double? Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street. Ryan Lumb : Hi, thanks. This is Ryan Lumb. So Just circling back sort of on the fifth generation reinvestment program, are you able to quantify for us the total capital investment we can anticipate in '19, and maybe the number of stores that are involved in that program alone? Joe Russell : So again, it's a rollout that we've now been testing, say for the last year and a half to two years. So through 2018, we began to test in a number of different markets, what we call our property tomorrow platform, which is taking a number of key elements from our fifth generation product and overlaying it into existing assets, some of it's -- somewhat straightforward, meaning it's enhanced, signage, updated painting schemes. We're also optimizing things like water usage through landscaping improvements, utilities around LEDs, changing office environment because in today's environment -- today's world environment with our new Web Champ 2 platform, we've gone completely paperless. We don't need filing cabinets anymore. We've got more space to create a better customer environments. So all those things of play through quite well in the properties that we've tested thus far which totals say less than 75 or so assets that we tested a number of different markets through 2018. So this year, we're main lighting the rollout with all the feedback and the reaction we've got in from customers, employees, et cetera, and it's starting here on the West Coast. We're likely to touch anywhere from say 100 or 150 properties in the next two to three quarters here in California, specifically, and then we'll be rolling it into a number of different markets literally for the next few years as we touch the entire portfolio. In 2019, the cost tied to this is plus or minus about $100 million. And it wouldn't be surprising over the next few years we spend a $0.5 billion or more as we roll this entire plan out and we like what we're seeing so far. So the properties that have been retooled to this new standard are seeing some residual benefit in a number of ways, it's still early in that regard, but we like what we're seeing and we think it's really another way to amplify and enhance not only the curb appeal, and the brand itself that resonates incredibly well to consumers, but it matches all the things that we're doing on an online basis as well. So again, it's a program we've got a lot of focus on and we're likely to see a fair amount of capital in subsequent years that's going to be dedicated to this effort. Ryan Lumb : That's helpful color. Can you maybe translate what have you -- in your test markets spent on a per square foot basis? Or what do you anticipate spending on a per square foot basis? Joe Russell : Yes, it's to -- I wouldn't point to that direction yet because it can vary. In some properties, it can be, what I would call a lighter rebranding because it may not need as many components and then other properties that could be more thorough or we're touching a number of different components of the asset itself. So I wouldn't point you to it a specific number on a per asset basis yet. Ryan Lumb : And then, I mean obviously, you had some very new assets that you recently developed and you're not going to be reinvesting in those. What is the total percentage of your portfolio that you would like to touch, roughly speaking? Joe Russell : Well, ultimately in its purest form, we would mainline or lift the entire portfolio to elements of -- again that's new standard that we're rolling out as we speak. So that's why I mentioned this could take several years. So we do have what we would characterize as five generations of product. So 2,400 locations, some of which have been in our hands for 30, 40 plus years. So those may need, in some cases heavier levels of again elements of the program that I talked to and some may not, But it's going to be on a case-by-case basis, the amount of enhancements that we're going to do property-to-property. So again, what we'll continue to do is moderate and choose assets that make sense to you in the early phases of the program and then we'll roll it out over time. And ultimately at a certain point, we'll get most of the portfolio. Ryan Lumb : Okay, thanks . Joe Russell : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ian Gaule : Hey, guys, this is Ian on with Ki Bin. I just want to go back to Shirley's line of questioning. The last couple of quarters, you've seen gains in our occupancy. And I'm just curious if that's going to be a meaningful driver the next few quarters? Or you kind of expect that more be on the rate side? Tom Boyle : Sure. Sure. As we've talked about consistently we managed by revenue and revenue and revenue per available foot, so we're not focused on either occupancy or rate. I will tell you at the end of April, we were sitting with occupancy up about 25 basis points. So we've continued to hold the occupancy gains that we saw starting with the end of the fourth quarter through April, but we're about to get into the busier summer leasing season and we'll update you on our next call as to where we go from here. Ian Gaule : Okay. And then on the expense side, on-site payroll has been down the last, call it, three quarters, are you feeling any pressure in any of your markets on payroll? Or should we see an uptick in payroll going forward, kind of what are your thoughts around that? Joe Russell : Yes, again part of the benefit of our rollout of Web Champ 2 at the property level has included in a number of property efficiencies and optimization strategies we've been able to deploy as we've rolled Web Champ 2 throughout the system in 2017 and 2018. And I would say going forward -- and we highlighted this to a degree in the queue. We're likely to see more normalized pressure and what I mean by that is some level of increase along the lines of inflationary cost increases tied to property payroll. There's no question we're in the most commanding employment arena that we've seen over the last decade. So we're assessing that on a market-by-market basis. We've got a number of very vibrant strategies around that, we're looking for not only cost efficiencies but ways to make our full team as productive as possible. So we've seen a lot of good traction around that, particularly in the way that we're using a number of technology opportunities. But I would say -- I would look to something more along the lines of inflationary pressure as we go forward. Ian Gaule : Okay, that's all from me. Thank you. Joe Russell : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs. Andrew Rosivach : Hey, thanks for taking my call. It seems like industrywide revenue growth is selling in there, and I don't think this is just Public Storage. Even without a lot of pricing power on the front end, it looks like the makeup has been because the in-place increase are either there larger or they are coming faster or there's a combination of the two. Am I right with that premise? Tom Boyle : Well, I think we've seen good trends with existing tenants overall and I think some of that is tactics that we and others in the industry are using to attract good customers that will stay with us. I think part of that probably relates to the mix of customers that we've seen. If you look at things like housing sales in many of our markets across the country, a deceleration in housing transaction activity which has meant, fewer movers as a percentage of our customer base on the margin, all those types of thing. And the reason I highlight that is, movers tend to be shorter length of stay customers. All of those things have resulted in more tenants staying longer and lower move-out volumes that we've been reporting. That is certainly helpful to our existing tenant rate increased program as they stay longer. They are eligible for rate increases. I do think the other thing that's happening in some markets, as you're seeing the real resilience in demand for the sector. I highlighted earlier on the call, markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago, which were hit were hit by new facilities earlier in the development cycle. We're seeing real occupancy gains there, which is certainly supporting revenue growth as we get through through 2019. So a mix of factors. But you're right that the existing tenant piece has been helpful, both in terms of move-outs, as well as rate increases. Andrew Rosivach : But it doesn't sound like you've either increase the rate increases or reduced the term at which you start to increase rates like rather than doing a one-year anniversary, you're now doing six months. Tom Boyle : I would say we've used consistent tactics year-over-year and how we're managing our rate. I would say we are sending more volume this year versus last year, which is driven by that some of the factors I highlighted earlier. Andrew Rosivach : Got it. Thank. Sorry, go ahed. Tom Boyle : I would, also maybe just highlight on the the revenue trends. We did roll in new same-store portfolio this quarter and the -- those properties were all stabilized, as we disclosed at the beginning of 2017 when they were rolled-in so all operating metrics, the rates of growth, the revenue, NOI were not impacted by the rolling if those new properties in the first quarter. Andrew Rosivach : Got it. I just -- my only concern for really the entire industry is if it gets too dependent upon rate increases, does the now it, right? And when does that impact the industry or if you have somebody whose in-place rents go up really, really fast relative to where they got in and what it could do to the reputation of Storage? But that doesn't sound like that's, it sounds like your mix that's changing. Tom Boyle : Yes, we haven't seen anything concerning from a trend standpoint. As I've said the behavior of that tenant base has been very solid year-to-date and really solid throughout 2018. Andrew Rosivach : Great. Thanks, guys. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey, good afternoon. Just one from me. Going back to Ryan's question on the property of tomorrow initiative. Joe, you mentioned signage and pain and what sound like standard maintenance items as part of that program. My question is how much of that $500 million spend over the next five years on that program is deferred CapEx, if any, I mean, this year's CapEx budget is there tripled to 2015 spend but square footage is only a say 10%, since I know a lot of that's new construction. So I'm just trying to determine if that initiative is essentially making up for under investment over the past few years. Joe Russell : Yes, it's not. The run rate and the amount of traditional CapEx that we've been putting into the portfolio has been in that $0.50 to $0.75 cents per square feet range and that's going to continue. What I'm talking about is again in the elements that go into the property tomorrow's again beyond just the simple pain. And those kind of simple upgrades is also will include additional enhancements that we're making to LED, landscaping, mechanical systems and other things are again longer term good drivers relative to efficiency and utilization from our water or electrical standpoint, those kinds of things, so it's more bent toward that. And our ongoing CapEx is a program that will consistently keep in place and this is in any way some kind of a catch up for that, it's really the noted benefit matching what we have, which is a very commanding brand that we can amplified through some of the,again the successes that we've seen through our Gen 5 products as well as the testing that I mentioned that we've done over the last couple of years. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the time. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Thanks. Just to go back to the balance sheet discussion you guys addressed you guys addressed some of the longer-term financing. But when we see some of the other larger REITs using commercial paper for the first time. I just wanted to give your impression of maybe some alternative sources of short-term debt that'll be I guess part one. And then part two, can you touch on your free cash flow expectations for the full year. You're likely more of a self-funder then some of the other REITs. Just your thoughts there. Thanks. Tom Boyle : Sure. So the question around commercial paper. We've started to add long-term debt to our balance sheet, we have no media plans to add short-term debt. We really like the long-term nature of preferred as part of our balance sheet. We've got about $4 billion of that on our balance sheet and we've added five and 10-year debt in the public markets more recently, so we're sitting on cash, right now with no plans for short-term borrowing needs. In terms of your question around free cash flow, we disclosed in our 10-Q last night, we continue to expect something like $200 million to $250 million of retained cash flow for 2019. And that's been reasonably stable number over the past several years. Todd Stender : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now return the call to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing comments. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Laurie and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at the NERI conference. Take care. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Public Storage first quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Brandy. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the second quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements, other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statement.

Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan. And thank you for joining us. We had a good quarter. And now, I'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Shirley Wu : Hi, good morning, guys. So, my first question relates to street rates. How did 2Q trend and so far in July as well, and also your move-in rates? Joe Russell : Sure. Yes, street rates were roughly flat in the quarter. But as we've talked about in the past, we focus more on move-in rates as those are the rates that customers will ultimately pay us once they become a customer. Our move-in rates were down 4% for the quarter, and this was the lever that we use to drive move-in volume. Our move-in volumes were flat year-over-year, which is one of the better quarters we've seen on move-in trends over the past couple years. In terms of other levers that we utilized in order to drive that move-in performance, advertising clearly being one of them. And a little bit less in promotional discounts. But flat on street rates and down 4% on move-in rate. Shirley Wu : Got it. And that's trended so far as well in July? Joe Russell : Yes, we're taking just in trends we we've gotten into July. Shirley Wu : Okay. So, and a follow-up to your marketing comment, so if [indiscernible] remains elevated, and it's a lever that you guys are pushing a little bit more. How should we think about the run rate for the rest of '19 versus the site concession? Joe Russell : Yes, well advertising has clearly been a lever that we've been pushing on through 2018 and into 2019 to drive volume. And those incremental move-ins from that channel support what is overall tougher move-in environment, and we like what we're seeing there. Public Storage has real advantages online with our brand name and our scale in local markets with which we can drive move-ins into the local inventory. It's the power of the Public Storage platform online. Advertising was up 49% in the quarter that follows up 28% quarter in the first quarter. And as I've said in prior calls, we're going to continue to push on that lever as we see good returns there. So I'd expect that we continue to utilize that lever in the second-half of '19 as well. In terms of other levers, we talked about using move-in rates and promotional discounts. While promotional discounts were down in the quarter, that is a method that we continue to use, primarily our $1 special for the first month rent, and we'll continue to use that through the second-half of '19 as well. Shirley Wu : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hi guys. Joe, just wondering if you can comment on the revenue growth here, the 1.9%, just wondering how that fared relative to your expectations? And then as we look at the trajectory, supply coming on here, the softness in demand you guys have spoken about. Would we be off base expected to trend back lower from here and into 2020? Joe Russell : So, yes, Jeremy, I think, first of all, certainly we were encouraged by the fact that we saw another step up in our revenue growth, so have been seeing acceleration if you look at the quarter-to-quarter performance sequentially over the last few quarters. Tom just reviewed one of the important ingredients and unique capabilities that we've got relative to leveraging the power of our brand, the initiatives we've got around customer search efforts, and the things that we do operationally that continue to give us tools to navigate what clearly continues to be market-to-market, in some cases, a heavy level of competition that is with us and could be with us for some period of time. We've been now in this band, say the 1% to 2% revenue range, you can look at our predicted metrics going into Q3 kind of puts us in that same range more or less. The things that we continue to use and drive relative to the capabilities however are encouraging because, again, quarter-to-quarter we're unlocking and using different tools and different levers to continue to drive the level of activity, customer acquisition, and things that we can do to operate, again, in some cases a very competitive market. Supply, as I mentioned, is going to be with us this year our tracking points, so again another year of about $5 billion worth of deliveries. We think in 2020 it's going to taper down a bit, maybe 10% to 15%, but you can't ignore the fact that's still heavy. It is shifting, and we've talked about that for the last few quarters from some of the more heavily impacted markets that got hit early in the cycle, to markets now that we've got even more focus on knowing that we're going to have to, again, ramp up our efforts to compete with new supply, whether it's in a market like Miami, Boston, Portland, Oregon. So we're keep a very close eye, and again, getting geared up to make sure that we're effective there as we've been over the last few quarters dealing with these other markets that have been hit hard. But the good news is the resiliency of the business overall is strong. Our customer base encourages us because we're seeing really no different behavior. Customers continue to be quite sticky. And again, it talks to the overall resiliency, coupled with the fact that our own capabilities of scale, the brand, and the technological tools that we're continuing to develop are working well. Jeremy Metz : Yes, and so it sounds pretty fair, a lot of it is internal, no real change of view on supply, if I heard you correct. I mean sort of in line with what you've been forecasting. Is that fair? Joe Russell : That's fair. And again there's -- without question it kind of points to on the flipside what we've been seeing on the acquisition front. There is a growing pool of owners out there that are taking product to market; they've got more sensible expectations relative to exit values. So we're seeing some good opportunities evolve on that end of the spectrum. But at the same time many developers still look at this product as very attractive product to be built, whether it's to own short-term or long-term and/or just flip because in some cases they can make good returns even in an environment where we're seeing many markets oversupplied. So, again, we're dealing with these levels of deliveries, as an industry, we haven't seen before. And as we all know, it can take anywhere from two, three, or four years in many cases for these deliveries to get stabilized. And until they are it's a competitive factor you've got to deal with. Jeremy Metz : All right. And second for me, and you just touched on it a little, but if I look at where you're buying in terms of price per pound and I look at where you're able to do the expansions and the developments, and even the yields you've talked about in the past, it seems like a pretty good tradeoff here. So just wondering what, if anything is holding you back from doing more development and expansions just given that obviously capital isn't an issue. Is it just human capital; is it the availability of site or expansion potential as you look at it? Joe Russell : Well, I mean there's a few things in the mix there, Jeremy. So, one of the things that we've talked about is the fact that we've got a pool of assets that in some cases we've owned for three or four decades that continually become good candidates for potential expansions. Now, you can look at that and say, okay, just go do it all at once or tackle it at one time, but property-to-property, city-to-city you have to work through a variety of different entitlement processes. In some cases you can't make any changes, and others you have to go into negotiations or processes that could take months, years in some cases. So you've got that factor at hand. And then the other thing that we're very cognizant of is the impact that any expansion creates to an existing revenue stream on a particular asset, so you've got to calibrate around all those factors. The things that we've been able to do is identify and leverage the skills that we've got in our development team into that effort. So you've seen on a proportionate basis, as we stand today, about 64% of our overall development pipeline is tying to redevelopment. Now the thing that has been trending down over the last few quarters, we haven't seen as many land opportunities that have been attractive, but there's some level of similarity with what's going on with land as it relates to what we're seeing on just pure acquisitions. Meaning there are a broader pool of owners out there that we're seeing, they're coming to us and saying, \"Hey, I've got a piece of property, thought I was going to take it through full entitlement or maybe it's already entitled, but I'm not going to take that next step to develop.\" So, we're encouraged by that. And the development team is out working hard to pull even more of those opportunities in one by one, particularly if they not only make sense in the near-term but long-term as well. So we've got, I think, some good opportunities in that realm going into the cycle that we're seeing ahead of us too. So, thanks Jeremy. I think we're going to take the next question. Jeremy Metz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi, good morning. First question, Tom, back to the move-in rent, so $13.81 square foot in the quarter, higher by about $0.22 a square foot. Historically the seasonal uptick is a little bit greater from 1Q to 2Q, and then rents tend to decline on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout the off-peak season. Is the more muted increase this quarter indicative of the pressure you're seeing across the system, and would you expect the same seasonal patterns to hold throughout the balance of the year or have you made some changes to pricing or otherwise that might cause the seasonal trends to change a little bit. I was just wondering if you could speak to that. Tom Boyle : Yes, sure. I did comment earlier around moving rates being down 4% year-over-year, which certainly takes into consideration some of the seasonality of our rental rates as we go through. I think generally speaking you're going to continue to see the seasonality as our occupancy and our move-in traffic is higher in the summer months that it is as we get into the fall and winter months. So the seasonality is not going to change. But we did use lower move-in rates in the second quarter as one of the levers to drive volume. So to give you an example, Miami, which is a tougher market that Joe highlighted, where we're seeing new supply impact operations there. We were successful in driving move-in traffic there. Move-ins were up year-over-year despite the incremental new supply, but we did utilize rate and advertising. So rates were down, call it, 7%-8% on move-ins in Miami in the second quarter. So, there's no question that there is rate pressure where there's new supply. And we're also utilizing rate to drive volume in some of those markets. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then as you push through rate increases to existing customers during the quarter, and usually May, June, and July are bigger months for that. Any pushback or change from customers or change in the rent increase program throughout the peak season as results started to come in? And then maybe in a market, like Miami, where there is some rate pressure and you have customers moving in at lower initial rates, is there any difference in sort of the rate increase program in those markets and at those stores relative to the balance of the portfolio? Tom Boyle : Sure. So the first component around just performance and existing tenants and the willingness to continue to remain customers post a rate increase to the rental rates, and so that's very consistent, in fact trending positively as we've gone through the quarter. So we disclosed in the 10-Q move-out volumes were down, which is what drove the increase in occupancy throughout the quarter, average up 20 basis points and actually finished up 50 basis points in the quarter. So, while move-ins were flat, move-outs were down, and that's because that existing kind of base is performing quite well. The existing tenants are exhibiting great dynamics. You look at delinquency numbers; they're supported by wage growth, the great labor market. So lots of good things happening there for existing tenants, and we continue to see that throughout the portfolio. In terms of rate strategies in different markets, certainly what's going on with the move-in and move-out dynamics within a local market will impact our strategies for existing tenant rate increases. I'm not going to go into detail there, but certainly those are some of the factors considered. In terms of how things have trended into July, move-outs are down again in July, so again very consistent trends. Todd Thomas : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just two quick ones from me. One, just going back to sort of the move-in volumes that you touched on, given the elevated marketing spend, the question really is, is there any change in the profile of the customer that's moving in today maybe versus a year ago? So, is that another way, is it more millennial or is it -- is there just no discernible trend on that? And sort of a follow-up to that would also be when you think about the returns that you are getting on the marketing spend, is that something that remains compelling where we can even see it increased even from these levels? Thanks. Joe Russell : So, yes, Ron, I'll take the first part of that and hand it over to Tom to talk about second part of your question. So from a customer standpoint, I wouldn't point you at anything that shifted materially whether you link it to millennials are becoming a different type of customer. The good news is they are becoming good customers period, and there is no both of statistically and/or trend that we could point to that says that that's any different than what we have seen with other generations as they age into the kinds of things that drive them to buy to take down a self storage unit. So many of the very similar and same drivers that have affected prior generations are too now affecting millennial. You could even argue there is at the end of the day as we speak today maybe fewer home owners out there that are much more sensitized to the cost of owning a home. They are looking at smaller apartments. They are making trade off of keeping their stuff in lower cost alternatives and storage fits quite well with that. We are seeing good traction. We are doing a lot of surveys relative to the types of customers that are coming into us, and again, no change there. In fact, we are continually encouraged that that too is evolving into a very powerful type of consumer that we see driving our business just as other generations have. Tom, you want to take next part? Tom Boyle : Sur. Yes, the second part of the question was on marketing spend and the return we are seeing associated with it. The comments I made earlier, we are seeing good returns. It is a process here that's managed very dynamically at the keyword level and local level such that we are adjusting our bids based on the demand response that we are receiving and the returns we are receiving. The returns have been good. And so we are pushing ever harder on that lever as we move through 2019, and we will continue. But we will also continue to monitor that and ensure we are getting the return that we seek. But returns are good there and we like that strategy. Ronald Kamdem : Great. I don't know if that was two questions, but the last quick one just on just looking the West Coast markets clearly some of the strongest performers there. And I think you have talked historically about limited supply. But maybe can you talk about what the sort of the existing tenant there? And if there is any rent fatigue given that it has been a couple of years of rent increases? Or, you are not seeing any noticeable trends? Thank you. Joe Russell : No, noticeable trends there. The difference between some of those West Coast markets is while I talked about Miami and moving rates been lower, Los Angeles moving rates were higher in the quarter. So, there is different trends going on in those different markets. Tom Boyle : Yes. And just to add that, from supply standpoint you are correct. I mean the West Coast has been basically shielded from the amount of volume. From a supply standpoint, we really don't see that changing again just because of lack of land inventory entitlement, complexity. Portland is under some stress right now. But outside of Portland, we feel very good about the competitive arena on the West Coast. Ronald Kamdem : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. Your acquisition opportunities still seem elevated. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of opportunities that are still in lease up versus stabilized? Are more lease up opportunities coming available to you that are interesting, or maybe just some color on the overall acquisition outlook? Joe Russell : Yes, Semedes. There are a variety of different reasons we have seen the uptick in acquisitions volumes. It's included -- some owners that have come to us directly, they haven't taken their properties out to market whether it's because again they are under some level of duress and/or they just made a decision that on the exit either specific property for whatever size platform they may have. And with that, we've seen a variety of different occupancy levels. We continue to look at properties that range anywhere from either newly developed and/or fully stabilized. I can point you to -- we did a four-building acquisition in the Miami area. Each of the buildings had different levels of occupancy, one or two or more stabilized and the other two that have been more recently delivered to the market. So there's a range there. And we are seeing and hearing that there are also there's a lot of activity out there relative to particularly within the brokerage community. Brokers are being asked to come in and do valuations for owners. In the last quarter, we saw a lot of inquiries coming into us with again a full range of different types of situations, let's just call it that. All of which we consider, we underwrite, we take a look at. So we really haven't changed. On our end the way that we analyze -- we continue to analyze and look at returns that we can get from these investments. What we are seeing are sellers that are far more agreeable and more anxious to make a decision to exit. And Tom again, has gone to maybe clear and more evident levels of stress. Others again, have just made a more rational decision and said, it's time and a good point in the cycle to consider an exit at maybe a level or a price that one or two years ago was much more elevated and we wouldn't have engaged from a conversation and today we are. So as we reported we've done more transaction volume this year than we did all of last year. We've got about $87 million under contract, and we're seeing again, beyond that good activity and [indiscernible] some of the situations that are playing through. Smedes Rose : Thanks. And I mean, just to follow-up on that, do you think? I mean, you mentioned supply, the dollar amount of deliveries coming down next year? I guess most of that is probably finance and under construction. Do you have a sense of just looking out further than that? I mean, do you think the lenders are now starting to rethink, the availability of capital to the industry, and we can start seeing those supply numbers really start to drop off pretty quickly? Joe Russell : Yes, that's tough to predict. There's a number of different conflicting drivers that are still in the mix. So there are still a lot of investors, private equity, and otherwise that are coming into the sector that haven't been in self-storage before. So there's some fuel that comes from that. As I mentioned, there are still, development returns that some individual developers are going to look at and say it's still a good reward risk balance. So the May launch and still may get the funding to do it. On the flip side, I don't disagree with your comment that I think more and more lenders are becoming more stringent in the way that they're underwriting and basically putting, lending packages out to developers. So hopefully that creates some level of added discipline we haven't seen. But, again, there's still fuel out there. And like I said, we're, sensing that there's likely to be in a 10% to 15% stage or shift down going from this year to next year. But that still puts you north of $4 billion of deliveries. That's a lot of products. So we're keeping a very close eye, if we're not confused about how it impacts certain markets, as I mentioned earlier, and the good news is we feel more and more encouraged that we've got the playbook to continue to navigate around us. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess most of my questions have been answered at this point, but just in terms of maybe business customers, any sort of change or anything new that you're seeing on that front, as customers, kind of looking to come into the self-storage product. Tom Boyle : Yes, Steve, I couldn't say something materially different. We have and will continue to embrace I would say a healthy level of business-related customers that ranges anywhere from -- something is tried and through to the landscape or a local contractor to maybe in today's world, some customers that are playing into again, this last mile distribution, focus and again, different types of entrepreneurs and/or even more sizable companies that do feel it sensible to have something in close proximity to another facility or a customer base et cetera. It can range from a percentage standpoint, property anywhere from easily say 10%, 15%, 20% so sometimes it's much higher. Again, depending on the location of a particular property, so, there's -- again, I would say, a consistent and good amount of activity that we see just from business customers. And we embrace and cater them just as much as we do to individual and trying to consumers. Steve Sakwa : Okay, and I guess just one other question, you've done some very, very large facilities, like Gerard up in the Bronx, several thousand storage facilities in units. Are there any kind of lessons you've learned off of some of these is this, kind of the economic returns to pencil out? How do you sort of look at that, as the few that you've done, and kind of the pace of those going forward? Tom Boyle : Well, we certainly have done more Gerard, we've got now several facilities that are close, and in fact, Jersey City is now larger than Gerard. Jersey City is our largest current system, our current property in our system, about 4200 units, we open that just a little over two years ago, today, it's nearly 90% occupied. So what leads us to and how we basically place design and configure something of that magnitude in the market is we use a lot of analytics, we look at the level of competitive activity and then we take a lot of the day-to-day metrics, we see in light properties that we may own a particular area to decide how big to go. But there's no question the bigger facilities like this create another level of complexity. That again, we have to tune our operational teams to, again handle. So Jersey City, it wouldn't be unusual for instances as we filled that property up to have 40 to 50 movements, literally in a weekend. And if you bench that against kind of a traditional size, storage facility, that might be a volume you see in a month. So you've got to have a team of people, running the asset, you've got at a different level, you've got different complexity relative to the design of the facility itself, number of elevators, the way the Florida floor configuration works on unit sizes. And with the amenities, though, however, with these configure facilities, customers level and again, they are very efficient, very customer service oriented, because we're running again, larger teams that are, clearly accessible and out the counter. Well, we're, opened all day long. And, again, we're looking at expanding that platform where it makes sense in many different parts of the country. So, that's too though, if I connect that to some of the activity that we're seeing on the acquisition side. Naively a number of owners or developers have come into the business thinking. Okay, it's a good idea to just go as big as we can, we'll go into the city. We will, if we were thinking about building a 50, or 75,000 square foot product, will go to 100,000 or 125,000 or even in some cases larger than that, without the skill, knowledge, and capability to actually run a facility of that size. And it's not unusual. And we see a time and again, where a facility like that can get to 50% or 60%, occupied, and it just stalls, because if you don't have the ability to drive volume. Understand how to cater to existing customers. If you haven't got the right technology capabilities or day-to-day customer service, you're going to, you're going to flat line. Now that creates so many cases, its a good opportunity for us, and we're seeing more and more of them. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thank you very much. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : Thank you, I just like to circle back on the marketing expense. How exactly do you calculate the return on investment for an increased for the increase in marketing? And how much the increasing market is just seeing the increase in click rates online and just how are much yet to pay you Google? Joe Russell : Yes, sure. So without getting into too much detail as to how returns are calculated, it's a pretty simple concept around what's a customer worth to us and what are the acquisition costs all in, which it takes to acquire that customer and ultimately get them to move in. And so, we have the ability in today's world online to track and understand much more about our customers and to be able to tune that those bids, much more dynamically than been done in the past. So we can monitor those returns on a customer-by-customer basis and really the keyword-by-keyword basis. Eric Frankel : Okay. Joe Russell : Okay. In terms of the overall cost and the competitiveness online, there is no question that we are not the only one pushing on this lever. Some of our traditional operating competitors are pushing on that lever as well and probably seeing similar good returns. So we would expect that to continue. In addition, we have other folks both regional operators as well as valet storage operators and other types of folks that are bidding on keyword and driving the cost-per-click higher. I think on the last call, I noted that cost-per-click for similar positioning was probably at double digits, maybe call it a team, it's north of that today. Eric Frankel : Okay, that's helpful color. Thank you. Just quick follow-up question. I just noticed in your Q that you expect to spend roughly $1.1 billion on investments over the next year or so. That's actually down from $1.4 billion last quarter. And so your comments have kind of implied that you are seeing it as expanding many of the investment opportunities. So I guess you are not budgeting as much as. Is there a reason for the disconnect? Tom Boyle : I think if you are looking at liquidity and capital resource analysis, we highlight that we have capital resources of about $1.1 billion. But then when you walk through the usage, a lot of them haven't been identified. So, one of the clear usages are development pipeline. Which as it stands today, we have about $329 million of cash required to complete that existing pipeline. But as Joe mentioned, we will be adding properties to that pipeline over time. But we would expect to spend that $330 million roughly over the next 18 months. In addition to that, we have acquisitions that are under contract at quarter end that Joe highlighted earlier, around $87 million. And we are seeing more opportunities there. So we would expect more acquisitions as we move through the year. But the $1.1 billion is really our capital resources which are the cash on hand that we have, the revolver capacity as well as retained cash flow over the next 12 months. Eric Frankel : Got you. So the revolver capacity is kind of the limitation on that number? Tom Boyle : No, I mean we could go out like we did in the second quarter and raise additional capital if there is opportunities that match. The financing environment right is pretty attractive from a rate standpoint. We could issue 10-year bonds today touch under 3%. Preferred are probably around 5%, maybe a touch under 5%. So, attractive capital market to finance incremental capital needs over the next 12 months. Eric Frankel : Right, right. Sorry. Okay, got you. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, just on the third party management platform, can we just hear I guess how it is performing? And then since you are being so acquisitive, you are obviously talking to potential sellers. Is third party management brought up in those conversations if you get a potential reluctant seller that you can manage, just maybe just some color there? Tom Boyle : Yes, there a number of things that we continue to see and learn through our entrance into the third party management business. So, the program continues to grow. Our backlog is building. The backlog as we expected will take time to turn into actual opening because it's primarily oriented towards either pre and/or in development opportunities. We have now got -- this year we have added about 23 properties to the program in total. Our entire program is 62 properties. But we are seeing and learning many different elements of the business as a whole including a number of owners that may have a range of different horizons to ownership whether it's more limited time or it could be longstanding. So with that we are going to come variety of different potential opportunities. The other things that's not surprising but there is a bit of activity around just owners that are looking for a change as well. So we are seeing some activity tied to that whether under a public third party management platform or a private one. So again we are seeing good opportunities there, we're able to balance. And now with the team built internally drive activity into even more markets that we want to grow from a scale and presence standpoint, so we've got more outbound activity time tied to that. And again as I mentioned a variety of different situations that could be interesting over time. Todd Stender : Okay, that's helpful. And then just to go circle back with the acquisitions, I don't know if you characterized what you bought in Q2 and then what you have teed-up in Q3 but just roughly the ones that are stabilized versus those in lease up and maybe just the rents. What kind of upside do you expect in these properties, are they stabilized or what kind of growth in rents can we expect? Joe Russell : Well it's like, I talked a little about this earlier, it's a mix. So we've got property to property, a variety of different either occupancy and stabilize revenue components to the assets themselves, some have been in place for a number of years, some are newer and again a typical again trajectory that a property goes through. You might see a quick lease up. But then from a maturity standpoint, the revenue doesn't stabilize for years beyond that until you look at again a tenant base that becomes more mature. So we're looking and seeing good returns relative to the investment we're making into the pool of assets that we continue to buy. And it's a collection of all of those factors. So again the other thing I mentioned we like and are spending more time with a number of situations, we haven't seen over the last couple of years, so the acquisition teams focused on those opportunities as we speak. Tom Boyle : Yes, and Steve, maybe I just point you to the 10-Q where we break out on Page 48, what the occupancy and rate numbers are for those acquisitions and you can see the 2019 acquisition at 78.2% occupancy. So clearly there's some lease up within some of the acquisitions that Joe speaking to and likely rent growth as those lease up as well. Todd Stender : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Most things been answered as well but I was wondering what was the average effective rate increase that you were able to pass through to existing customers this year? Tom Boyle : I would say trends have been very consistent there. As we've talked about in the past that that does move throughout the year both in terms of quantity as well as rate based on what we're seeing in our market is averages are around that kind of high single digits 10% type number but no real change there from a strategy standpoint. Michael Mueller : Okay. That was it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning all there. Your debt to preferred equity ratio is about 33%. Do you have a view on longer term what that mix should look like? Tom Boyle : Longer term, we said we're committed to both of those markets as financing tools. They're both provide great attributes. We thought it made a lot of good sense back in the fall of 2017 to really add debt to the playbook in order to finance acquisitions and really gives us access to a deeper institutional pool of capital that allows us to raise more in a shorter period of time to fund acquisition opportunities. And so, as we look at those two markets, I would expect that we continue to utilize both. As you highlight right now about 33% of that is debt and about 67% of it is preferred stock. We don't have a particular target where we're going to target a specific number but I would expect that we utilize both going forward. Ki Bin Kim : But in the current environment does one look more appealing than other? Tom Boyle : They look frankly both looked pretty good right now the gap between a 10 year bond and preferred stock offering today is around 200 basis points which is pretty consistent with the post-crisis averages. So pretty consistent, we obviously just raised $500 million of 10-year bonds in April, we redeemed 6% preferreds because they were in the money at the end of June as we go through the year, we've got five and seven eighths preferreds that are callable in December that certainly are in the money as we look at them right now. So I would expect there certainly could be an opportunity to add preferred stock to the capital stack as we go through the year in addition to what we did with bonds earlier. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just going back to the advertising question, you said you're getting a good return on advertising spend. I'm sure the utility curve to everything, right. Where do you think we are in that utility curve of getting a good return on advertising? Tom Boyle : Yes, we're still seeing good returns and so that you've seen us increase our spend throughout the period. There are some keywords that certainly are at levels that we feel comfortable with where we are and there's others that we can increase further and it will depend on the traffic we see in our local markets as we dynamically evaluate that, but returns have been good. And that's very much a decision that is at the very local and granular level not at the aggregate level. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll now hand the floor back over to Ryan for any closing or additional comments. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Brandy, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Enjoy the rest of your summer. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us. We reported our sixth consecutive quarter with same-store revenue growth between 1% and 2%. In the quarter, our expense growth did accelerate as we utilized marketing to drive volume in our busiest move-in season and our non-same-store property saw another good lease-up quarter with 21% NOI growth. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Shirley Wu : Hey, good morning guys. Tom Boyle : Good morning, Shirley. Joe Russell : Good morning, Shirley. Shirley Wu : Good morning. So my first question has to do with the marketing expenses. It continues to be up call it almost 70% in 3Q and this has been a few quarters of elevated marketing already. So as you think about these last few quarters and the effectiveness of marketing versus some of your more traditional levers like the rate side, the discounting, how are you thinking about the strategy going forward whether that's in 4Q or into 2020 on the marketing expense? Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Shirley. This is Tom. I'll take that one. We used similar mix of tools in the third quarter that we have throughout the year. So I won't go into the details on those in particular, but lower move-ins or lower move-in rates and less promotional discounts year-over-year. But speaking directly to advertising, as we've discussed on previous calls, we've been increasing our spend through 2018 and 2019 as we've grown incrementally more confident in the demand response we've received through that channel. So advertising was up 70% in the quarter. We pulled pretty hard on this lever this quarter in order to get move-ins during the seasonally busy move-in period in July, August and September. We like the returns we've been getting from advertising third quarter included. The incremental move-ins we're achieving for the incremental cost. As marginal returns are attractive, that advertising expense is upfront, while the customer value will be earned over time. And kind of stepping back Public Storage has real advantages online and we're taking advantage of those first of which is our brand name synonymous with our product, a top search term within the sector almost half of our paid search volume comes in on brand searches which drive efficiencies as well as conversion. And away from paid channels a meaningfully portion of our move-ins come directly to us unpaid about two-thirds. The second component is scale. We have top market shares in the top metropolitan markets in the United States, which allows for a better richer shopping experience for our customers and good conversion at the local level. So this lever continues to work with occupancy ending up the quarter 70 basis points. We'll continue to plan to use this lever in coming quarters. Joe Russell : And again just to amplify what Tom's speaking to we clearly, again strategically made the decision in the third quarter to again increase the spend because we're not confused about the fact we have a very challenging and competitive customer environment, but we knew going into the busy season, we could lever and get good traction. And we're pleased by the amount of activity that we were able to drive through this marketing spend. Occupancy at quarter end was up 70 basis points that sets us up very well to go into Q4 and Q1, where we're not likely to see as much leasing activity. Because again, those are traditionally are lowest volume quarters, but we continue to like as Tom said the value and the traction that we get by putting that level of spend into our marketing efforts. Shirley Wu : Got it. Thanks for the color. So on the volume side, could you speak to what you were seeing in terms of volume-wise in terms of move-ins and move-outs for 3Q? And also a little bit on the rate side as well for the move-in rates and street rates? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, hitting the volumes first. So, volumes were for move-ins were roughly flat down 0.8% and move-out volume was down more. So, a consistent trend we've seen year-to-date and really through last year as well. Move-outs were down 1.9%. So, we continue to see a very good performance from our existing tenant base as length of stays have extended and move-outs have declined. So, great stable existing tenant base which is really supported by a solid labor and macro environment. In terms of rate, I mentioned this a moment ago, our move-in rates were down about 5% for the quarter. So, pretty consistent with what we saw in the second quarter; move-out rates were also down modestly 0.6%. So, all of that's disclosed in the 10-Q. Shirley Wu : Great. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks Shirley. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Joe maybe just to start it'd be great to get your broad view on the state of supply as we sit here today. And as we look across your top markets, some of the weaker ones were expected with supply in back more or less generally there. As we look across your footprint and the impacts of your own specific portfolio, can you maybe talk about where we're at in the current supply cycle relative to your footprints where they may be peaking and may start to recover next year versus where some markets are still in the heat of that battle? Joe Russell : Okay. Sure. Again what we've been talking to now, obviously, for some time is the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years starting in 2016 when about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then that doubled in 2017 to $4 billion; 2018, $5 billion; by all accounts 2019 is going to equal 2018. And our view of 2020 is we will likely see some decrease in, again, deliveries and it may be anywhere from say 10% to 20%. We're hoping clearly as many others are that it's 20% or even better, but we continue to track markets and statistics that are guiding us to about that, again, 15% to 20% down. So, you take that into consideration holistically, again, over this time period you've seen anywhere from 1,600 to 2,000 new properties in our markets, that's about 120 million square feet. And again market-to-market particularly where this elevated supplies have we see the most commanding headwinds. So, maybe more specifically to your question Jeremy so where are we today? On the good news front, deliveries have been elevated in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin, and Chicago. Those have all been poster child markets for these elevated level of deliveries and tougher operating markets, but we're now starting to see that supply volume decrease in some cases pretty dramatically. But we're still dealing with the lingering effects of the amount of supply. So, you take Denver, for instance, in 2018, a little over 2 million square feet went into that market. The good news is it was less than half of that this year and again; it's going to notch down likely in 2020. But holistically that market has seen about a 35% increase of supply in that time period compared to existing base of assets. So, you've got to continue to maneuver around that elevated level of activity. Again using markets like Charlotte, Austin, Chicago, and Houston as examples where any one of those markets hit $1 million plus level of deliveries; Houston more extreme. It's a big market no question, but it hit about 2.5 million square feet of completions in 2018. It's ratcheted down and we like the impact of that. But again we're going to have to continue to maneuver around, again, how we're dealing with customer acquisition, pricing, et cetera. The flip side is we're still not out of the woods because you go back again to our prediction about what's going to happen in 2020 with plus or minus about $4 billion of assets coming into the markets. And we're going to see that impact as we're tracking, and again, these are statistics tied to what's under construction and in development, okay? So, this isn't -- these aren't deals that are planned or potentially contemplated. They're in motion, okay? So, you're going to see more impact in Portland, Boston, Seattle, many parts of Florida, D.C., Minneapolis, and New York. So, we're clearheaded about the things that we're likely to need to do there. We've got a good playbook. We're going to continue to drive a lot of the things that we can to maximize revenue opportunity maximize opportunity in customer acquisition. The third element, I'll talk to as well is the fact that we do have and we like what we're seeing in our own development pipeline. So we've got about $540 million in today's pipeline. We've shifted out of markets like Texas as a whole for the most part where the last two or three years we put a lot of development activity into both Houston and Dallas to a lesser degree into Austin. But now we are going into a broader number of markets where we're seeing again opportunities to get good traction of these new developments. And then if you even look at our legacy if you want to call that or the development pipeline that we've delivered since 2013. It continues to lease-up quite well. I mentioned in my opening comment that this quarter we saw about 21% NOI growth in that portfolio. Collectively it's about a $1.4 billion investment and today it's roughly at about 80%. So we like and we'll see very good traction out of that in coming quarters because again we've got more occupancy and we've got the impact of matured revenue opportunities, which again is clearly part of our successful strategy as we again both develop and mature these assets. Jeremy Metz : And can you just touch on Cali quickly in that context as well? Joe Russell : Touch on -- I'm sorry what? Jeremy Metz : Just in the context of where we're at? What kind of -- what are your views on supply for across your California? Joe Russell : Calling California itself? Jeremy Metz : Yes. Joe Russell : So okay. So for the most part California is in very good shape. Now going south to north there's parts of San Diego County we're keeping a close eye on to because there's some elevated deliveries in some of the outer markets within San Diego County. Orange County and L.A. County for the most part are pretty, I would say inactive from a new development standpoint primarily because there's very little land available and it's very expensive if in fact you're able to find anything here right here in the L.A. metro market may be a little bit more activity out in the Inland Empire. When you go into the Bay Area again San Francisco -- South San Francisco, again no worries there. A little bit of heavy activity in the San Jose market that we're keeping a close eye on, but again not a big amount of inventory on a percentage of existing base. So we continue to see in our own development pipeline in these markets where we've really had the opportunity to take existing assets for the most part and do some pretty meaningful expansions. And again repeating what I just said around the traction we're getting from that activity the expansions that we're doing are leasing up really well. So we're very pleased by that seeing very good traction and again for the most part I would say California is in pretty good shape. Jeremy Metz : Appreciate that color. And the second one for me quickly. Just I want to go back to the move-out rates. Tom, you mentioned the 60 basis points here historically or even just looking back to past few years at least you've had a rent roll down which makes sense in the context of rising rents and the in-place bump traction that's now flipped here the past two quarters. So just wondering is that more of a reflection of the overall rents you're bringing customers in at? Or is it a reflection at all in strategy shift and how aggressive you are in pushing in-place rents just given the widening spread to market there? Tom Boyle : I think it's largely the fact that as folks move-in at lower rates the move-in -- move-outs are coming out at lower rates that's the biggest driver there. No real shifting strategy on existing tenant rate increases. We've talked about modestly lengthening length of stays which has contributed to contribution from existing tenant rate increases, but no real shift in strategy there. So the decrease in Vale rental rates is driven by move-ins coming at lower rates. Jeremy Metz : Thanks for the time. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you in your Q you talk about kind of the appeal essentially of the fifth generation products that are coming to market. And I'm just wondering is there an opportunity to take advantage of what apparently is still very strong pricing for older stabilized assets maybe in your portfolio and redeploy assets in some of the growth markets you talked about earlier with the newer facilities? Joe Russell : Yes, sure Smedes. So a couple of different areas to talk to there. So first of all, I think, it's well known that one of the benefits of the product type itself is you can go through decades of use on our assets and they can be every bit as vibrant in today's world and even more so in many cases than they were originally developed. So there's very little obsolescence that we're seeing anywhere in the portfolio. What we're doing though to actually continue to enhance even some of those revenue streams and again amplify performance property to property with some of our older assets is a program we've talked a little bit about which is our property of Tomorrow program where we're going through and putting to your point what we would call fifth-generation attributes into many of these assets where we can again enhance the curve appeal of the asset through more modern paint, scheme signage we're improving the office and customer areas that align with some of the technology issue or technology strategies that we've had. We're at this point going through California from a first-wave standpoint, where we've taken about 125 of our generation one through three or four properties some of which might be say 30 or 40 years old. They're in phenomenal locations. They drive very good occupancy and rent levels, but we're going to hopefully even see that much more opportunity once we've basically taking them \u2013 taken them through the various stages of the elements that we would include in our generation brand-new properties. So that's working quite well. We're getting good reception from both customers and our employees as well. And then, we're also now rolling that program into a number of markets nationally, which will include in the first quarter parts of Florida. We've touched many parts of the boroughs, if not all of those properties we're going to go into other parts of New York. We've already gone into markets like Chicago for instance and the Carolina. So, anyway we're pretty excited about what we're doing. Now, from a cost standpoint we've talked about this program in the context of ultimately being about $0.5 billion or more once we get through the entire portfolio. 2019 we will have spent about $110 million on the program. And in 2020, we'll likely spend even a little bit more. Again, as we touch the markets I talked to. So far we're very pleased. Now, as we're doing this we're also making some technological updates to the properties, where as we speak relighting interior LEDs on assets for both energy efficiency, and again better customer environments. We have begun changing out our access control systems which is now based on a centralized system which we've never had before. It's going to give us a lot of good data that we haven't had around customer activity. We're adding solar to a number of properties. So we've got a number of different elements of the overall program in motion. And like I mentioned we're getting very good feedback from it and like the results. Smedes Rose : Great. And then I just wanted to ask you too you \u2013 last quarter you mentioned that the third-party management platform was largely geared to predevelopment and in development properties. Just given what looks like a continued kind of deceleration in trends across multiple markets is there an opportunity to bring on or convert more independence I guess more aggressively to your platform? Or is that your strategy, there is to - Joe Russell : Again, we're seeing our pipeline definitely continue to build. The pipeline is dominated by assets that are in various stages of development. That's pretty typical for again this kind of a platform again from what the industry as a whole has seen. We have however also seen some opportunities to bring more stabilized assets into the program too. And again, a number of owners are clearly interested and are anxious to come into our platform because they like and see the amount of revenue generation that we can provide to them based on all the metrics that we're able to again weave into their assets whether again it's purely based on our brand the optimization that we get through, search, our marketing efforts the scale that we've got in markets. So again, it's a program we're pleased relative to the momentum that we've got in it. We signed in the quarter 13 additional assets. So today, we've got about 75 properties in the program. And as I mentioned, the backlog continues to build. Smedes Rose : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Thanks for the comments on supply. Just wanted to follow-up on that and on rates. Tom you mentioned move-in rents were down 5% in the quarter. They've been down since late 2017 and the decrease in move-in rent seems to be increasing a bit here. As you think about where we are in the cycle with regards to supply and the absorption of new supply that's taking place across the industry it sounds like you're still seeing some good traction on the occupancy side, but where do you think we are in the process of seeing asking rents adjust any thoughts on that? Tom Boyle : Yeah. I do think if you go back several years, we've had a consistent trend of using move-in rate in order to drive volume. It really is a market-by-market dynamic. So, as we think about where it's going in future years a lot of it will be dependent on what happens in those markets. So just looking at move-in rates for the third quarter for example, you have markets like Los Angeles or Phoenix, where you're up call it low to mid-single digits on move-in rates given what's going on there. The flip side is, you've got Florida markets like Miami and Tampa, which are being impacted by new supply and those move-in rates are down call it 5% to 10%. I throw Houston into that bucket as well. And so the move-in rates we're using are not across the board, it's really a tactic to drive volume in areas where we're competing for new customers in a more competitive environment. As we move into \u2013 to 2020, we're likely to see the mix of those markets continue to shift. So as we've spoken about in the past looking back at the markets that were more challenged in prior year, we've seen some of those markets actually improve meaningfully to a market like Chicago or Washington D.C. that was maybe more impacted earlier on in the cycle, is seeing better traction this year than they were last year. As we head into 2020, it's going to be a different mix of markets. But I think I'll let Joe speak to new supply in aggregate by market, but it's a pretty dynamic management on our end as we seek to maximize revenue within those local submarkets. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then I realize you send out far fewer rent increase letters, I suppose into the off-peak leasing season. But does the current environment that you're experiencing here in the market, does it cause you to consider using up a little bit on the number of customers that you might be sending letters to or the rate at which you might push? And also can you remind us whether there is sort of a governor in place around how much of a percent above Street you'll increase existing customers' rates? Tom Boyle : Sure. So strategy-wise we plan on using consistent plans through the fourth and next year's first quarter in the slow season. So, we do send rental rate increases throughout the year, and we'll do so in the coming quarters. In terms of the magnitude and the quantity, we're looking to optimize that at the tenant level. We think we do better on that year in and year out. So, ultimately what we're seeking to do is maximize revenue. So we take into consideration the probabilities of vacates as well as the cost of that vacate and replacing that tenant, et cetera. So, things vary throughout the year, but consistent strategies and no change or more conservatism or more aggressiveness as we get into the next few quarters. In terms of a governor, there are things in place that we use in order to make sure that we are maximizing that revenue over time. And so there's different governors in place and different strategies, we use in different types of environments. But certainly, Street rate and the rate with which a new customer would move-in is the key component of the strategy. So, as tenants get higher above Street rate the cost of that tenant leaving is higher. Todd Thomas : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Yes, good morning out there. First question I guess is just in terms of the sort of the monthly trends you saw in the third quarter, was there anything noticeable as it relates to kind of the same-store revenue trend that realized occupancy ended kind of on a strong note at the end of the period and average occupancy was up 40%? And I'm just curious kind of how things trended throughout the quarter. Tom Boyle : Sure. So in terms of the operating trends through the quarterly, we actually did see improving trends from July through September. We did do some things in September that aided that including our typical Labor Day sale that we extended a bit this year to drive traffic, and ultimately we like that from a revenue standpoint both in the quarter as well as moving forward. So, we did see a modestly improving trends through the quarter from July through September, and as we head into October, generally consistent trend. So nothing really to speak to other than\u2026 Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I realize you guys don't provide guidance, but historically kind of the guidepost for revenue growth has been to kind of look at that annual contract rent per foot and sort of look at the average occupancy and the end of period occupancy. And for the third quarter that kind of gave you a range of 1.3% to 1.6% and that the actual number came in a little bit below that. And as you look at the fourth quarter it's kind of penciling in for call it 50 -- excuse me, 50 basis points to about 80 basis points, which would be sort of further slowdown. Is there something we're sort of should be thinking about as we head into Q4 and into next year? Joe Russell : No. Steve what I would point you to that those are metrics that we think create guidelines. I mean, there can obviously be some variation in and out of different conditions. But at the end of the day, they're relatively within the zone. And what I would point to as well, Tom mentioned that through October, we've seen consistent occupancy impact. And again, that's intentional meaning we saw that in the quarter 70% or 70 basis point increase. And at the moment, it's in about that same zone. So it ties to the strategic things that we're continuing to do. And again, a tough acquisition -- customer acquisition environment to do something that others may be don't have the same capabilities do which is really still in this environment lift occupancy with a broader intent of that ultimately gives us many things we like around revenue generation. So, we're continuing to do that. And I think we've set the stage for Q4 pretty well as we intended to do. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess just lastly on the marketing expense, is there any way to sort of just help separate kind of the actual cost per click or the actual cost from kind of the Google search versus kind of the increased usage of the Google search and sort of search paid advertising type stuff. So I'm just trying to sort of disaggregate the pricing increases versus I guess volume of usage? Tom Boyle : Sure. I would -- without getting into specifics around keyword bid strategies or otherwise, I would say it's a good mix of both increased cost per click as well as increased bids to drive volume. So a good mix of both. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Just wanted to follow-up on Steve's questions. First on the expense. This elevated level is obviously purposeful, shouldn't be a surprise. I'm curious though, as we head into next year, as we comp these higher numbers, is this the new norm and we should expect increases from here this level on up? Or is this level just kind of artificially high because it's part of a unique -- part of the strategy for today that might normalize lower going forward? Tom Boyle : Sure. So Ki Bin I think there's a couple of things I'd highlight. One is clearly we pulled on this lever pretty hard in the third quarter and just spoke to some of the strategy thinking behind it from a revenue standpoint. But I think stepping back it's managed very much dynamically at the local keyword level. And so, as we monitor what the returns are, we're going to oscillate our strategies thereafter. So we can't predict exactly what's going to happen going forward. I would kind of step back in terms of advertising spend and you think about where we are and what we're battling from a customer acquisition standpoint and just provide a little historical context. So if you go back in time advertising as a percentage of revenue for Public Storage, at the end of the last cycle beginning of the cycle hover between call it 2% and 3% of revenue. As the customer acquisition environment, got very healthy and certainly fundamentals were very solid in the beginning and middle part of this cycle, we decreased our advertising spend. In 2016, for example, advertising spend was just a touch over 1% of revenue in the same-store pool. We're looking now year-to-date it's hovering just under 2%. So it gives you some context that yes, while we've been increasing marketing spend, we've been doing so from a low base in what was a very attractive customer acquisition environment in 2014, 2015, 2016. And now we're in a certainly a more challenging and competitive environment and we're using that tool like we have in the past to drive new move-ins and occupancy. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. That's helpful. And going back to the revenue question and Street rates. So this quarter your move-in rates were down 5.3%. You extended the Labor Day sale a little bit longer. You got the occupancy gains that you're looking for with lower rates and higher advertising. So I'm just curious, if you're setting yourself up for same-store revenue growth to potentially reaccelerate in the fourth quarter? Because maybe your -- the customers you've drawn into your company are paying that 50% off rate. Some will move-out, some will stay and they'll get the higher rent. Maybe the occupancy isn't cash flowing day one. So maybe there's some built-in gains to recapture in the fourth quarter. I know that's a big question but it just maybe feels like 4Q might look better than 3Q? Tom Boyle : So Ki Bin maybe what I'd say is, we obviously like the strategies we used in the third quarter. Some of them have short-term impacts. Certainly, we're looking to manage medium- to longer-term revenue and ultimate customer lifetime value through that lifetime. In terms of whether where we're accelerating or decelerating, we continue to face real challenges from an operating standpoint, particularly on move-ins in many of our supply impacted markets, that's not going to change as we get into the fourth quarter and we continue to see that through October. You're looking at certain markets that have been more challenging and you look at markets like Atlanta for example that has had a more challenging third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And we're going to continue to see markets like that that will be a drag on both move-in volumes as well as revenues we get into the fourth quarter. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, two quick ones for me. First is just you sort of did a good job laying out some of the markets that you mentioned or maybe seeing elevated supply. Just out of -- do you have a sense of -- when I think about private equity and private capital investors, has the appetite for the product from their standpoint changed at all? Or is it still pretty attractive sort of asset class even in those markets that may have had maybe too much supplier early on in the cycle? Joe Russell : Yes, Ronald, I think again that investor type continues to look at self-storage as a product in very positive terms. We're seeing more entrants either come into or basically kind of scout the industry in a variety of different ways where we're seeing again that type of investment vehicles come in to a variety of different markets. More often than not they're looking for scale, which can be challenging from time to time. Cap rates really haven't adjusted for the most part, but yes there's definitely a fair amount of capital that still wants to come into the market. And some of those buyers maybe thinking in terms that I would say, could be somewhat risky because they may be basing it off of proformas that may or may not make sense. May be based on levels of traction that were seeing one or two years ago that have certainly continued to change. So it's a new and different dynamic that's come into the sector. And by all accounts we don't see that shifting anytime soon. Ronald Kamdem : Great. My second question, I think on previous calls you sort of mentioned that sort of the acquisition opportunity maybe had increased. I think you mentioned buying some assets off of auction. Just maybe can you give an update on that? Is that something you seeing? And what does that mean for potential acquisition volumes next year? Is this something we could see ramp significantly? Joe Russell : Sure. So again statistically obviously you can see -- again through, what we've done in the third quarter and then what we've got in our pipeline and whether we've already closed or under contract for the fourth quarter. We're likely to acquire plus or minus about $375 million of assets this year. And that's 2x of what we did from our acquisition volume in 2018 for instance. And as I've talked to in the last couple of quarters, we do see more and more owners coming to us in a variety of different stages whether they've already built assets. They may be in the first year or two of lease-up. They're not making either pro formas or revenue projections and they've got some level of -- I would call it anxiety. I wouldn't call it pronounced flat-out stress at this point, but there's definitely more anxiety-related conversations that we're having. By virtue of that we're seeing sellers being far more reasonable around valuations. That's clearly what has led to some of the acquisition volume that we've already done this year and continue to see come our way. We've been able to capture some really nice assets in a number of markets that we wanted to build scale into. And we're anticipating that there is more of that to come. And the other factor that I would tell you that is starting to percolate a bit more than we've seen recently is even what I would call, entitled land, whether an owner again may have acquired a piece of property 1, 2 or 3 years ago. Again anticipating proformas that they felt confident about 1 2 or 3 years ago, clearly things have shifted. They're reassessing their own development returns and we're seeing more opportunities to actually engage and particularly -- and potentially find some interesting opportunities there. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thank you. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors. Eric Frankel : Thank you. I don't want to beat the marketing expense issue to death, but I would like to maybe to better understand the rise in the cost per click phenomenon. Is that just related to just larger more overall supply and some more competitiveness on the market that's causing people to be more aggressive marketing space? Is it valet storage? Is it something else? What do you think is the issue? Or is it something -- or is it just a monopoly practice of search? Tom Boyle : No. I think it's a good mix of a lot of the factors you highlighted. It's a combination of your traditional operators being willing to spend more to acquire more customers. As we've increased our spend, we've seen incremental volume and I suspect others have as well. And so there's a component of your existing folks being more competitive. Certainly the Google platform is a great one and the fact that its action based. So they let us compete within their sandbox. And so the environment is more competitive and you see folks being more aggressive in their cost per click. There are also not only your big public REITs, but also your regional operators that have been more aggressive as well as some of your nontraditional storage folks like valet for instance with some of those operators have been more aggressive in cost per click as well. So that all adds to a higher cost per click environment which as we look at our spend that's a component of it. But then we need to again at the local level do we like the bids and the volumes that we're seeing? What do we get if we increase? What do we get if we decrease? And that's what we're managing. And ultimately as I spoke earlier, we like the returns. We'll see whether the rest of the environment and the rest of our competitors like the returns as cost per click continue to go higher, but we like what we're seeing. Eric Frankel : Okay. Just another quick follow-up regarding I guess, the valet storage. It's obviously quite a new initiative that UPS announced their -- an initial foray into sort of a valet storage business. Do you have any thoughts on how that might impact the self-storage industry going forward, if that model is to expand that model? Joe Russell : Yeah, Eric definitely an interesting announcement. And we've tracked. We've experimented. We've done a variety of different customer surveys around this whole concept of valet on-demand type platform. And thus far we continue to see very little disruption and/or change in our own customer behavior, because we continue to see pretty distinct differences between what that product offering is compared to what traditional self-storage is. So the one thing that UPS, obviously, has that others prior have not is more of a logistical network. The platform right now is based on a bin concept. So not clearly understanding what way it might evolve over time. They're testing it out in one market. So we're going to continue to watch and understand as we have with the other platforms. But overall the whole valet model, we continue to see as one that might be more akin to a traditional moving and storage type customer versus a traditional self-storage customer. A big difference to a self-storage model is you literally pay for access each and every time you want your goods. And then at the end of the day, you don't even know where they are. So those are two pretty big hurdles relative to what, again a core self-storage customer traditionally wants, which is access and basically again knowing that they can again get to their goods without having to pay fees to do so. So we'll continue to track it and see what evolves. Eric Frankel : Okay. Thank you. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, thanks. Just back to the elevated marketing spend, it definitely tipped into negative same-store NOI territory, it's hitting the stock today as you know. But just wanted to get a sense of where you guys are thinking about guidance, maybe just for some key metrics to set the right expectations? Obviously, you're not running your business on a quarterly basis it's for the long-term. But when you get an outsized expense item like this that pops up that does contribute to you guys trending negative, just wanted to get a sense of maybe setting the right expectations going forward? Tom Boyle : Sure. So you're right, we don't provide guidance and we don't manage for the short-term and we've talked about how we thought about the advertising spend for the quarter. In terms of line by line expectations for expense growth, I would point you to our 10-Q particularly in the MD&A, where we do walk through what the trends are within each of those items. I won't go through it in detail because, obviously, the folks on the phone can go through and read it. But I think the expense pressures generally continue to mount be it property taxes, property level payroll and the like. So even away from marketing expenses, there's no question that operating expenses have been more under pressure this year and we think that's likely to continue for many of those line items. But I'd point you to 10-Q in terms of some guidance as to where we're headed. Todd Stender : Got it. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Yeah, hi. Just going back to the other topic of rent growth and realized rent growth. I mean, what I guess was different in Q3 compared to Q2? Because if we look at the prior quarter going from Q1 to Q2, we saw a pickup in the growth rate. We saw a pickup in REVPAF as well, but then it ended up even with the marketing spend coming in maybe a little bit better than half of what the Q2 was. So I guess was there anything abnormal in hindsight that you see in that Q2 print? Or was there something abnormal and what appears to be the -- in print the Q3 levels of -- with a 0.7% realized rent growth and 1.1% REVPAF growth? Tom Boyle : Sure. I wouldn't point to anything in particular. As you move through the second quarter and into the third quarter, the busy season with lower move-in rates that is a big drag through those quarters on contract rent growth. And you've seen that this year, you've seen it in previous years as well. So there's nothing really new there. Maybe pointing to one factor that maybe made in the second quarter a little bit better and the third quarter maybe a little bit worse if you look at discount trends for example, which are a component of revenue, discounts were down almost 7% in the second quarter were down, about 4% in the third quarter. So there's lots of moving pieces there, but generally if you look back while we've been battling this new supply between second quarter and third quarter, we've seen contract rent growth decelerate over that time period pretty simply because we've been using lower rates in many of our markets in order to drive that volume as those folks move in during the summer that contract rent growth declined. Michael Mueller : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Okay, thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman on Smedes. Last couple of years you've tapped the unsecured debt market, right? So you're sitting on about $1.5 billion of U.S. unsecured and you've put some capital out in Europe from a natural hedge for your stake in Shurgard as well. Sort of curious what your appetite today is to take in additional debt? I know you redeemed the preferred and reissued, but I didn't know if there was an appetite given how low rates are to raise that capital? Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Michael. I think as we've talked about in the past, we do have appetite to add incremental debt as well as incremental preferred as we have uses of capital. So, so far this year, we've issued over $1 billion of capital. As you've highlighted, our preferred activity is largely been to refinance existing preferreds, and we're hopeful we have the opportunity to continue to do that. As we move through the fourth quarter, there's a series that becomes callable in the fourth quarter. But stepping back from a strategy standpoint, we plan on using both unsecured debt, which we can get attractive rates to your point, as well as preferred stock which is a higher cost. But historically speaking right now is offering a very historically attractive coupons, sub-5% is what we achieved in September. So, we like both markets and we plan on using both going forward. Michael Bilerman : I guess is there an appetite to maybe take advantage of the spreads you can get to increase cash flow when your operating fundamentals are a little bit weaker, right? So, take advantage of being able to lock in 10, 20 or even 30 year paper refinancing preferreds capture 250 basis points of positive spread and at least help offset some of the dilution from a weaker core portfolio? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, we have been reducing the cost of our preferred portfolio by refinancing it. We like the $4 billion of preferred we have outstanding. We think it's a very good source of permanent capital. Taking what you said to the extreme, we could use the revolver and redeem some preferreds. But from our standpoint, we like that permanent capital in the stack. We will seek to refinance it to better rates. And going forward, in order to fund acquisition and development activity, we will be using both debt as we did earlier in the year as well as preferred. Michael Bilerman : And then, just going back to the Vale discussion, it's a mix basis combination with Iron Mountain from a strategic perspective gave them the distribution and logistics network that others didn't have before. Have you seen any impact at all, as they've gone deeper into a lot of the markets you're in? Joe Russell : Yeah. Michael, I wouldn't say we've seen anything pronounced and different. It still goes back to the way I characterize the product as a whole. So again, we've seen very little disruption and again change in -- again the core customer that continues to look for all the benefits of a self-storage product. So, we're going to continue to monitor and see what comes from any of these realignments that are going on. It's interesting that Clutter actually went in a different direction and actually bought hard assets, which is very different even from a traditional Vale model. So again, there seems to be a lot of movement in that space as a whole and we'll continue to see what evolves from it. Michael Bilerman : And then, sorry, my last one just -- and I recognize there's a lot of fires going on within California right now. And I do hope all of your friends, family and coworkers are safe. Disaster unfortunately is one of the drivers of your demand. Is there any sort of thought in terms of what this could be doing, A, from just perhaps a lack of demand because maybe your facilities are closed and there is no power? And then does it drive anything else given California is your largest market? Joe Russell : Yeah. Again, we're obviously keeping a close eye on this and I appreciate the good wishes because yeah, there's a lot of stress in some of the areas both northern and southern California with the fire season that we have at hand. But at the moment, we haven't seen any direct impact to our own portfolio. And what can be unusual with fire events is traditionally they in themselves really don't create a lot of elevated activity. So obviously, it's always dependent upon where the specific fires are. And to what degree -- what comes with it. They seem to be like-for-like very different events. And say a hurricane, where we see a lot more, broader disruption or impact to a particular market. But we're keeping our fingers crossed that California can get through this, in a good way. But it's -- there's a lot of stress out there. Michael Bilerman : Yeah. Thanks for the time. Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Jon Petersen : Great, thanks. But I make it good one. So you've got a like a few public players out there that do that lend to some of the other self-storage owners. I'm wondering, if that's something you guys have considered doing possibly as a way to grow your third-party management business to leverage your cost of capital, and just given your position in the industry? Joe Russell : Yeah, Jon, I wouldn't tell you that's an intentional focus point of ours right now. There is a lot of capital that's in the space at large. So we are going to continue to be more focused on growing our own portfolio through our own direct investments et cetera. And really haven't tapped into kind of a lending arm. And you see far more different things that we can continue with our balance sheet. Jon Petersen : Okay, got it. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : And that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks Maria. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Look forward to seeing many of you in a couple of weeks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you Maria. Good day everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements.

Of course, if you have additional questions after those, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you Ryan, and thank you for joining us. We had a good quarter where we reported our seventh consecutive quarter with same-store revenue growth between 1% and 2%. As we previously disclosed in an 8-K filed on February 14, we submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the stapled securities of Australian-based national storage REIT and its controlled entities for AUD 2.40 per share Australian dollars. Please refer to the 8-K and we won't provide any updates on this call. Now, I'd like the call to be open for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Shirley Wu : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Joe Russell : Hi, Shirley. Shirley Wu : So my first question is on the marketing spend. So it's up roughly 50% in 2019. So I was curious as to what your thoughts are on the effectiveness of any incremental spend? And how you think that's going to trend in 2020? Tom Boyle : Sure. Shirley, it's Tom. I'll speak a little bit about our advertising spend in the quarter and then outlook as we head into 2020. So we've been communicating a pretty consistent strategy on advertising throughout 2019. We've liked what we've seen with the increase in spend through 2019. And so as we've spent more money, we liked the demand response we received from customers. Advertising was up 40% in the fourth quarter. That rate of growth did moderate from the third quarter and as we've discussed on our last call, we proactively pulled harder on the advertising lever in the third quarter during the busy season to attract more customers during that time period. Stepping back, we continue to have real advantages online. Our brand name which is synonymous with our product and a top-search term drives a meaningful portion of our move-ins either direct to site or through unpaid channels. Roughly two-thirds of our move-ins come through unpaid channels. Those are our largest channels. In addition to that about half of our paid move-ins come through brand search and brand advertising, which comes at a lower cost. So those give us some advantages with which we are utilizing today online. We talk a lot about Google. Google is a primary portion of our advertising spend, and we really like that tool given it's dynamically managed and very local and granular, so we can set our bidding strategy similar to how we set our pricing on a very local level. But in addition to that, we do utilize social media and affiliates as well. So we spent a lot of time talking about Google, but it's a broader marketing plan. As we head into 2020, I would anticipate that if we continue to like the incremental traffic that we're seeing from the advertising spend that we'll continue to spend. And so far in 2020, we continue to like what we've seen. So, we would anticipate that we continue to pull on that lever along with rental rate changes and discounting to drive traffic to our stores in what is a -- what remains a challenging operating environment. Shirley Wu : Got it. That's helpful. So -- and then on the flip side, can you talk a little bit in terms of what you're seeing for your move-in rates in 4Q, and so far into 1Q as well as street rates? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, as you know Shirley, we don't really like to talk about street rates. We think that move-in rates are really more valuable. So move-in rate were 2.4% in the quarter, which is a little bit better than what we saw in the second and third quarters. But we did have lower move-in volumes. The move-in volumes were down 3.5% in the quarter compared to roughly flat in the second and third quarter. So, while move-in volumes were down 3.5%, we continue to be benefited by lengthening stays of existing tenants and continued very good performance by existing tenants. And so, move-out volumes were down 1.5% as well. So continued good -- good trends there amongst initial or existing tenants, but the initial acquisition of customers remains challenging in this operating environment. Shirley Wu : Got it. Thanks guys. Tom Boyle : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey, Joe. Hey, Tom. Joe, I wanted to go back to NSR. I understand you can't comment on the process here, and that's not where the question is related. I guess as I think about what you have going on in the U.S. you have a lot going on in the developments and expansions. You've been increasingly active on acquisitions. You have the broader CapEx program. You initiated a while back and that's still ongoing. You got some tech initiatives. We all know about supply in the market, the pressure on revenues and expenses. I guess you take all that together, why would now be the time to look to make a move outside the U.S. in a big way? Joe Russell : Well, Jeremy, I appreciate, and you did a good job characterizing the variety of things that we're looking to do from a capital allocation standpoint. So as an entity, we have and always will be inquisitive along a number of different fronts whether it's within our borders here or where opportunities may lie outside of our borders. You can see that from obviously the investment that we made into the Shurgard platform a number of years ago. We have talked over the years about, again the outlook and the desire on our part to continue to vet and understand markets outside of our borders. And with that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities as they arise. Looking at the things you talked specifically about, yeah, we have had over the last year in particular or particularly strong uptick in the amount of volume that we've done, particularly tied to acquisitions. We're seeing a healthy amount of attractive opportunities that continue to lead to the kind of volume that we did in 2019 where we bought approximately $430 million of acquisitions, 44 separate properties. And again that's higher than the volume that we've done in the prior four years. So, we continue to vet and leverage our relationships, leverage the amount of opportunities that we're seeing out in the market and we're seeing good trends. We also have a decent backlog of acquisition activity going into 2020. So, we continue to be equally focused on everything that happens right here within the United States. And then from time to time if things happen outside of our borders, we're going to take a strong look at that too. You mentioned the development and redevelopment activity, that too again for 2019 with a vibrant part of our business. We brought 40 properties online whether from ground-up or redevelopment; again about $375 million of investment. And again, if you combine that activity with the acquisition activity, we brought in about 85 additional assets into the portfolio. We think they're great additions to the platform and we will continue again from the development -- redevelopment standpoint to fund that business as we're finding attractive opportunities. We're seeing good land sites that are coming to us. I would tell you frankly, we're seeing more of those right now than we have in the last two or three years, because there is a little bit of rewinding relative to some of the spec development that has been going on in certain markets. So we're seeing a number of additional land sites that are attractive. So we're going to continue to look at that. So overall I mean we've got a number of very positive things happening. The management team is well-prepared to embrace the kind of volume and again from a capital allocation standpoint, the way that we can drive good returns to our shareholders. And we've -- no confusion, our balance sheet has been and continues to be ready to fund a whole range of different capital allocation initiatives. So we continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing out there. And like I said, looking at the beginning of this year we've got some good momentum at hand. Jeremy Metz : Thanks for that. And the second question for me, in your 10-K you do alluded to the Prop 13 initiative on the ballot granted timing of any reassessment, or it getting actually to happen if it passes is uncertain, but if there -- is there anything you can share with us on the potential impact if it did pass? Or any color on your assets there? And what that mark-to-market could look like on the tax side? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Sure Jeremy. So we do benefit from a very strong portfolio of about 440 properties here in the State of California and many of those assets are in great locations and were acquired or built by the company years ago, which gives us a great competitive position in many of our markets. So we like -- we really like the portfolio. In the 10-K you highlighted we did include some disclosure. I think that's the best information we can give you to allow you to be able to underwrite what you think the impact would be. So we provide to you in that risk factor what our 2019 State of California net operating income is and also our property taxes for the State of California. So, depending on what time period or valuation strategy you think will be employed, you can model what you think the impact will be. Jeremy Metz : Thanks. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Jeremy. Joe Russell : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little more on the acquisition side. You had pretty high volume in 2019 and it looks like 2020 is starting out ahead of where you were at this time last year. And I mean, would you expect that you could see the same kind of volume -- acquisition volume activity this year that you were able to put up last year? Joe Russell : Yes Smedes. It always tough to predict. I'll just try to answer the question around. Again the number of things that are driving the opportunity set that we've been able to capture. So we are seeing a higher level of sellers coming into the market that have either acquired or built assets over the -- say the last three to five years with certain sets of expectations, many of which have not met either pro forma or have not basically put them in the position that they expect it to be in at this point. A number of the deals and frankly the majority of the deals that we did in 2019 were off market, so some of this comes with enduring relationships that we've got with these owners. And again some of that's harder to predict to get to your question well how much volume might we see in 2020. The thing that it is pronounced and I think we talked to quarter-by-quarter last year was the theme of more owners coming to us with more anxious motivation to get out, right? So with that, it's again a more vibrant arena. Our acquisitions team is very busy, looking at a number of opportunities again with the kinds of circumstances that I described. And we also have a number of owners who have also come to us and said, hey, it's been a great business. Timing is right. And they too want to exit for a variety of different reasons. We continue to evaluate the quality and the pricing of these assets. Our filter is as tight as it ever has been. And frankly with that we're off to a good start as you mentioned in 2020. How much of that plays through for the balance of the year to be determined, but if you step back and look at the wave of development activity in particular that's taken place over the last four or five years there's a pretty strong collection of assets that have come into various markets many with ownership histories that have nothing to do with long-term commitment to the storage business. And there are a lot of entities out there who are looking for exits. And we've been pleased by again the amount of volume that we've seen come through the quality of the assets and in our view again the appropriate time to acquire and see ultimately good returns from those investments. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. And I just wanted to ask you you've lined out development spending. Just when you look at the quality of your portfolio now you've talked in the past about bringing some of the older facilities kind of more -- have more curve feel for lack of a better word. Do you still -- is that still a pretty big effort to be done this year? Or did you -- how much of the portfolio I guess do you feel like needs to I guess be improved from a looks perspective? Joe Russell : Yes, sure. So yes you're speaking to what we call our Property of Tomorrow program. So that launched in 2018. Last year we put about $100 million into that platform where we retooled approximately 250 assets or so in a variety of different markets. And if you look at 2020 the size of that program will take another step up. So it's a multiyear program. We're embedding a number of our latest generation assets into existing assets to get the not only curb appeal impact, but relevancy to our brand; the optimization of some of the physical characteristics of the asset where we're retooling lighting, for instance; in some cases we're putting solar on assets; we're optimizing the customer environment; and doing a number of different things to again enhance the overall quality because frankly we've got many assets that continue to do phenomenally well. And we've just gotten to the point where we think that ultimate lift to our most recent generation five quality standard is very appropriate. Customers are responding well to it. Our employees are responding well to it. We're prioritizing as we're ratcheting through the full portfolio. And again this program is likely to take five years or more to get through the portfolio at large. But we are prioritizing around market concentrations higher revenue markets where we're seeing even better impact from that investment. So all things considered we're seeing good traction from the investment in the program and it will continue like I mentioned over the next few years. Smedes Rose : Great. Thank you. Joe Russell : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Tom, I don't think in the 10-K you explicitly provided kind of the fourth quarter average move-in rates or the move-outs. I guess we sort of backed into the numbers for both of those and got about a 17% decline. I was just wondering if you a had those? Or does that sound about right? And I know you don't provide guidance but do you feel like that number is kind of getting towards the bottom? Or do you feel like that can continue to sort of widen out a bit? Because if that 17% is right that was probably the widest number we've seen on that statistic. Tom Boyle : You did a good job with our numbers. The gap between move-in rents in the fourth quarter and move-out rents on a per square foot basis was 17%. If you look back at prior year it was 16%. And so while it did get a little bit wider. That's a seasonally wider time period. And so that obviously sounds like a reasonably large number but we lower our rental rates seasonally through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter as occupancy dips and we have vacancy to fill. So that's a strategy that we've employed year-in and year-out for a number of years and you saw that again this year. In terms of overall move-in rate trends, I think it's really a story of markets and it's hard to talk about at a high level what it is we're going to see for 2020. But if you look at the different market performance in the fourth quarter, you have markets that have been impacted by new supply where move-in rates, we lowered proactively to drive volume. So a market that I'd highlight is Houston and we're seeing some encouraging trends in Houston as it relates to year-over-year move-in performance as we went through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, but it's come at a lower rate. So fourth quarter move-in rates in Houston were down 16%. But for the first time in a little while in 2019 we started to see real volume in Houston. So move-in volume was up north of 5% in Houston and we're seeing better traction as we go through the first quarter. We have markets like Houston or Atlanta where the impact of new supply continues to be felt and we have little pricing power in those markets where we're utilizing rate and we're utilizing advertising to fill in occupancy.  The good news is, in Houston we are getting good occupancy traction. Right now we're sitting at 300 basis points plus year-over-year occupancy, just looking at my dashboard this morning. So getting some good occupancy traction, but it's coming at a lower rate. And then going to flip side a market like L.A. where we had positive move-in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So stepping back, we continue to think there's going to be ebb and flows through markets as they're impacted by new supply in 2020. Just as another snapshot in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported 1.1% same-store revenue growth. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we reported 1.2% same-store revenue growth. So pretty consistent revenue growth, but if you look at the contribution from the different markets, it's a barbell and you've got markets like Chicago, Denver and Dallas that actually are the best year-over-year change in revenue growth. And the flip side is, you continue to have Houston be a laggard; Atlanta as I highlighted and Boston that was impacted by new supply in 2019 that impacted us. So another quarter of reasonably consistent revenue growth in the fourth quarter, but the market contributions continue to shift as we navigate through as -- a tough operating environment. Steve Sakwa : Okay. I guess maybe second question just kind of big picture maybe for you or Joe. Just in terms of like the pressure from supply. I mean it's interesting to see that revenue growth or decline in revenue growth seems to be stabilizing a bit. And frankly it was a little bit better in Q4 than we thought. Generally speaking, I realize the markets will change and mix around. But do you feel like the overall competitive pressure from new supply is beginning to kind of find a footing here? And maybe it doesn't get a lot worse from here? And the question then is how quickly can it improve in '21 and beyond? Or do you still feel like there are more supply coming and there's more competitive pressures as we move into 2020? And how does that sort of play into the -- I guess the Google spend on the advertising side? Joe Russell : Well there's a lot of correlations between all those things, Steve. And you're right we are seeing less deceleration. We feel like we have a strong tool kit to continue to maneuver through higher supply markets. As Tom mentioned some of that is shifting the supply picture nationally. We'll have another strong year of deliveries in 2020. It could be plus or minus say 10% down from what we saw in 2019. Again these are elevated levels of construction that we're now going into the fourth year of a range of anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion in deliveries. And again, if you don't have the right playbook to deal with supply as it impacts particular assets say right down to that 3 to 5 mile trade area, you could definitely have some pretty strong headwinds to deal with. And frankly that's where we continue to see some not all, but some of our acquisition opportunities as well. The interesting thing and it ties to the resiliency of the product overall the resiliency of our own brand, et cetera is we are seeing deliveries come down in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago; and not ironically those are some of the markets now that we're actually starting to see some decent percolation, and we're encouraged by that. Now going into this next year, we've got our eyes wide open on markets like Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami, D.C. and New York, because there's more deliveries coming to those markets, some of which haven't had the kind of development activity in quite some time. But reflecting on some of the comments Tom just walked you through relative to again, the ways that we're using our own brand, our marketing strategies, the ways that we're improving the quality of the assets directly themselves, the way we're doing our own revenue management pricing strategies. I mean, we continue to have ways that we feel are strong components to work through these higher supply conditions. The outlet -- or the outlook beyond even this year is more murky. We are seeing fewer C/O deals get delivered to the market. I think that's an encouraging sign. There may be some tapering down of the part of the market that was driving again share development just based on spec developers out there just flipping an asset and trying to get a quick return, because there were many buyers that were basically just aggressively taking down empty facilities. That volume is down quite a bit. And part of the reason it's down, again, it's -- you could look at it and say this is probably a healthy thing as rents are down too. So they're not making the pro formas that they intended to maybe when they acquired that piece of land or had it tied up. So there are a number of things that are starting to work through that hopefully will lead to a more balanced market-by-market set of conditions. But again, this year in 2020, we still got the lingering impact of the supply that's been built over the last say two to three years. We'll have again a number of deliveries this year. But we're highly encouraged by our own capabilities and the things that we can do uniquely enough to keep again this band performance at least what you've seen for the last seven quarters in pretty tough market conditions. If things actually start improving then we'll hopefully see the upside of that too. It's too soon to tell. But again, we'll continue to use all those tools that we've got. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Joe Russell : Thanks, Steve. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on Steve's question there about revenue growth. Maybe taking a step back and thinking about it at a high level, Joe you just commented again and in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that it's a seventh straight quarter of revenue growth between 1% and 2% for the company. Do you see that continuing to hold? Joe Russell : Well, again, Todd, we're not going to give guidance. Again, the point that I just made and to Steve's question was tied to the fact that, yeah, we've got tools. We've got ways again to continue to deal with higher supply conditions and we'll have to see how that plays forth going forward. The deceleration that we were dealing with has eased. Will it continue to ease? We'll see. But again, we feel very confident that we've got the right set of strategies and capabilities to deal with the environment that we've had over the last two or three years. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then -- so switching to investments and thinking about an expansion overseas. You're invested in Europe and have a platform there. But in terms of thinking about investments outside of the U.S. or halfway across the globe, can you just help us understand the synergies from investing outside of the U.S. that may not be obvious for self-storage? Joe Russell : Yeah. The only thing I really speak to Todd is what we've said consistently for a number of years, which is we will continue to evaluate a variety of different markets. It's likely, but not always, but likely beneficial to enter any market we're not in through some kind of a platform. So -- okay look at Shurgard. That was the platform okay? So does that mean that's the one and only way to do it? Absolutely not. Is it a way that can have certain advantages? Yes. So -- and then beyond that as I mentioned in my opening comments we're really not going to talk more specifically about any particular transaction we're looking at. But that again thematically is and will continue to be the way that we'll evaluate any opportunity not that again it has to be tied to a specific platform but there are many inherent benefits that will likely come through, if it's the right type of platform that aligns well with what we do right here in the United States. Shurgard was a perfect example of that. So I can just point to that and say that's -- that was a very successful playbook. Todd Thomas : Okay. And to the extent you were to make a large acquisition something in excess of the sources of capital that the company has over say the next approximately 12 months, how should we think about -- obviously, you have a lot of capacity and access to capital but how should we think about funding a larger investment if something were to materialize? Tom Boyle : Yeah. We're not going to comment any specifics. But balance sheet is in very, very good shape. Last year was a good capital raising year for us. We extended the line of credit. We issued $1 billion of preferred. We redeemed $1 billion preferred. We issued some debt in the U.S. We recently issued debt in Europe. So we've got a lot of capital sources at our fingertips and capital is pretty attractively priced today. So overall, we like our capital sources heading into the year regardless of what the capital will be allocated to. Joe Russell : And maybe to put the exclamation point on that the balance sheet has never been in better shape so. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just going back to the Prop 13 discussion. Could you give us a sense of their average tax year basis in California? Tom Boyle : Well, I think what we've disclosed we feel is adequate for you to be able to do some underwriting. If you want to talk through that on a one-off basis we can certainly do that. But I think we disclosed $42 million of property taxes paid in 2019 and we disclosed our California NOI. So that should give you an ability to underwrite different assessed values and compare those assessed values and ultimate taxes to what we paid last year. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And going back to your acquisitions, I'm just trying to get a sense of if there's been any incremental change in the thinking strategically for -- about your excellent growth? And basically trying to get a sense of are more assets and deals just fitting in the parameters that you have always set? Or are you also expanding the parameters that you're looking for? Or our IRR thresholds? Joe Russell : Yeah. I mean. We're never -- we've never been an IRR buyer Ki Bin. But no I wouldn't say in any way, we've widened our underwriting and made some additional accommodation to what we've always done historically. We have a pretty stringent disciplined methodology that we use for acquisitions. Again, we're -- frankly we're just -- we're pleased by we're seeing good quality assets and more of them that meet our thresholds. And we've been pleased by the amount of volume that's come to us. And we're going to again continue to stay focused on the range of opportunities that are out there and the team is working hard. And many of these situations don't evolve at a moment's notice. Some of them take many years in some cases to evolve so we've got a whole collection of different kind of opportunities around us. And we're going to continue to vet and determine whether or not they're the right types of deals to bring into the portfolio. We like the quality that we're seeing with the range of assets. It's a combination of some more mature assets and some relatively new assets as well. So good quality, good location, very additive to the platform and again -- again like I mentioned in 2019, he pulled in 44 assets. And overall, it's kind of a seamless transition. So ops team is ready to continue to absorb that volume and more and it's all going very well. Ki Bin Kim : And I remember years ago, you guys had a pretty big emphasis on buying things below replacement cost. Is that still the case? And how do some of these deals compare to replacement cost? Joe Russell : Yes we definitely -- we strip out a lot of different financial factors and compartmentalize them and that being one, okay? So just again to step back I mean, we have the only development platform in the public arena and we by far have the biggest development platform in the United States. We understand replacement costs, quite well. We deal with it literally on a daily basis as it ties to our own development and redevelopment activities. It's a great benchmark for us to continue to evaluate the price point that we're looking at assets. And that is a key factor that we look at. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Lumb of Green Street Advisors. Ryan Lumb : Thanks. Just wondering if you could expand on what drove labor costs higher during the quarter? And if it was sort of onetime in nature or if you anticipate this to be some sort of longer-term trend? Tom Boyle : Sure. So as you look at labor costs in the quarter, on-site property manager payroll was up about 6%. The drivers of that was largely wages. And we've talked for now a number of years about the very tight labor market that we find ourselves in today nationally. There's certainly some pockets that are even tighter than the national numbers. And so what we've done over time is make sure we're being as efficient as possible. And some of that comes down to some of the initiatives tied to Web Champ 2. And otherwise that we were able to utilize efficiencies and reduce number of hours, but ultimately we've continued over that time period and including last year to increase wages to attract a competitive employee and provide a competitive package for employees to give our customers a good customer service at the property level. So wages is the short answer. I would anticipate that we continue to have wage pressure as we go through 2020. As always, we're looking at the ways to be more efficient and utilize the hours that we have best but would anticipate that wages will be a pressure in 2020. Ryan Lumb : Sure. And then I guess related to the comments that you made on the Property of Tomorrow initiative. When you think about the expansions, is it a decision that is made based on a market-by-market basis? Some markets are more apt or more suited for expansions? Or is it sort of an asset-by-asset basis? Some assets are well suited for an expansion regardless of market. Or how is the decision made there? Joe Russell : Yes. So Ryan, yes the Property of Tomorrow program isn't directly tied to expansion. That's really tied to like-for-like asset condition. So separately we do have all of our initiatives tied to redevelopment, which would include expansions. So -- and that does go right down to a case-by-case basis. So what comes with that is there are a whole host of roadblocks that you might have to go through depending on zoning any kind of approvals and opportunities to actually expand an asset that at face value may look like a prime candidate, but it may be a condition where frankly you just can't get the appropriate zoning and ability to expand the site itself. So that's one hurdle you have to work through. There are economic hurdles that you have to work through because if we're going into an asset and disrupting current income, it can be quite dilutive in some cases. So you have to measure and understand that as well and then counterbalance it with the kind of returns and opportunities that you would get by putting basically whether it's some additional size into an existing property through a single, larger building or a multitude of again new gen five properties or in some cases actually tearing down the entire site. So there's a whole host of parameters that go into that but it goes right down to a case-by-case property-to-property base. Ryan Lumb : Sure. Thanks guys. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Tom, I think, you were talking about, marketing spend levels, expecting to continue to spend in 2020. Should we be in the mindset of you've seen the spend levels ratchet up a notch on an absolute dollar basis. And you're thinking more about maintaining that absolute level? Or we could see it move up again. And just have notable growth on top of a year of pretty accelerated growth? Tom Boyle : Yeah. So we did see accelerated growth, in 2019. But if you go back through 2018, we actually continue to ramp good spend in 2018 as well. And we've liked what we've seen. So, there's no question that we spent more in 2019, than we did in 2018. So your point around comps, as we get into 2020, is a fair one. We don't manage our advertising spend, based on what we spent last year. We manage it based on, what it is we're getting for it. And what the return is on it, in the current period. And so, if we like, what we're seeing, we're going to spend even more in 2020. We won't hesitate to do that, if we like the returns. And the flip side is, we're managing it dynamically. So, there will be markets where we've toned down advertising spend. And ones where we likely increase, as we get into 2020. Michael Mueller : Okay. Tom Boyle : The one thing I highlighted on the last call was just, stepping back and thinking about advertising spend as a percentage of revenue. And the fact that it was 3-plus percent, historically in previous cycles. And it got as low as about 1% of revenue in 2015, 2016, when frankly we were fall and didn't need to spend on marketing. We've been increasing it consistently over the past several years. And we anticipate that we increase it in 2020 as well. But if you look historically, we're in a comfortable range for advertising spend. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. And then, Joe, looking on the -- looking at the 2020 acquisitions and kind of what I guess what you have earmarked for under contract right now. I mean, what are the buckets that those would fall into, if you split it between -- here's a bunch of what the market would consider to be stabilized properties versus here something that's clearly in lease-up. Can you just kind of walk through what that split have been? Joe Russell : Yeah, Mike. It's a combination. There are assets that are newer, say, anywhere from one to three years old. And then, some that are more stabilized that have been in place for 10-plus years. So, it's a combination. And it's motivated by many of the things I outlined earlier in my comments. Some owners come into the market, thinking they were going to get a quicker profit or be able to turn an asset. And achieve whatever pro forma hurdles they were looking at and kind of step back and said \"No, I don't want to continue let's look at a quicker exit\". And then, some have been more mature owners that for a variety of reasons too are saying this is a good time to exit. So it's a combination. Michael Mueller : Got it, so, total mixed bag, okay. Joe Russell : Yeah. Michael Mueller : That\u2019s it. Thank you. Joe Russell : You bet. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Sorry, just one follow-up, guys. On just the Google kind of ad spending and just some changes Google might have made. I think, there was a reference in your 10-K about, maybe level the playing field. I'm just curious is there anything you can share with us about maybe just how Google ad searches are working? And just things that maybe are leveling the playing field there? Is there any real change in that dynamic that we should be thinking about? Tom Boyle : Yeah. No, I think, we included that to just describe frankly the evolution of paid search on Google and the other search platforms, over the last couple of years. I think that they've got a great business. And they obviously seek to garner as many competitors in the keyword auctions, as they can. And I think they're doing a pretty good job of it. And we're just highlighting the fact that it's gotten more competitive and they're doing a good job of getting more people into those auctions. Steve Sakwa : Okay. So it wasn't that there is something more recent that really changed. It's just more the general trend? Tom Boyle : Yeah. General trend there and they've got a great business. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. That's it. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And that was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to, Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to interacting as the year progresses. Have a good week. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Erica. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m here on the line of Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 1, 2020. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of the statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website publicstorage.com. As usual, we do ask that you keep your questions limited to two initially. Of course, after that, please feel free to jump back in queue, if you have additional questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan. And thank you for joining us. We wish the best for all of you listening in today, particularly those that have been personally impacted by the pandemic. I want to begin by thanking our employees, customers and business partners for their extraordinary efforts and flexibility as we adapt to this environment. Our focus is simple. Safety is the top priority in everything we do, protecting our employees and customers. We are operating our entire 2,500-plus portfolio in all markets as we are an essential business. The need for self-storage even in disruptive times like these is yet again being validated. In that regard, our priorities beyond safety includes servicing new and existing customers as our communities navigate through these challenging times. To do so, we are supporting our frontline employees in several ways to optimize customer service. Protocols are in place that reinforce social distancing, keeping properties clean, and offering customers multiple avenues to rent or access their space in a contactless way. At the start of the pandemic, we also established the PS Cares Fund, which provides childcare coverage, extended pay time off and additional hourly compensation to our entire team of property managers. I can\u2019t overstate how valuable their commitment to Public Storage has been and will continue to be as they serve our 1.5 million customers. As Public Storage approaches its 50th year, we have clearly weathered significant economic cycles, and this one will likely rank as one of the most extreme. We have a proven playbook to maneuver through severe economic and natural disasters. Our teams are battle tested, our product is resilient, and we have intentionally crafted a fortress balance sheet to not only survive, but thrive in times like these. At its core, the full Public Storage team is well equipped to not only face whatever challenges arise in the near term, but confidently, we will find new ways of applying our unique strength and fortitude to find opportunities. Now, I will hand the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Good afternoon and hope all of you are doing okay. First question, just trying to tie some of the comments, Joe, you made on the, I guess fundamentals or what you\u2019re seeing and the market validates the stability of the sector, resilience in the past versus some of the -- I guess, the color around COVID-19 in your press release, which seemed to be much more cautious. Can you just, I guess, discuss? That\u2019s as my first question. Joe Russell : Yes. Sure, Jeff. So, again, we\u2019re obviously in an environment that is new and different for everybody. We\u2019ve all been through, a number of economic cycles of different degrees. As I mentioned, we, in particular, from time to time, go through what we call natural disasters, hurricanes, and otherwise. This is clearly even different than those because it\u2019s health and science related. The predictability of this environment is to be determined, at best with a lot of information none of us have dealt with before. When we do look back at prior cycles, again, our product type has played through very well and even the great recession. We were pleasantly surprised by again the resiliency and the adaptability and relevance of the property type itself. On one hand, we clearly know that there continues to be a high degree of need and usage of the product. This month or last month, April, we moved in 82,000 customers into our portfolio. Now, again, that\u2019s down, but on the flip side, there\u2019s vibrancy there, there\u2019s need. We see it also with the amount of activity at our properties that we can now track holistically, because we have a centralized access system. So, again, whether it\u2019s at a raw consumer level and/or anything that tiers into service oriented from a business that may or may not be facility, even the type of activity that\u2019s going on with this COVID economy. There is a true and I think valid need for the product itself. So we are looking at the future with a fair degree of caution, because, frankly, we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to play through. And I don\u2019t know how realistic you can predict anything, because we\u2019re six weeks into this. And there\u2019s just going to be a number of things as we\u2019re discovering day-to-day, week-to-week that this environment will create even additional types of pressure points that we haven\u2019t seen before. Now, again, other things though are somewhat similar so far to what we\u2019ve seen with extreme economic cycles. So, in the great recession, our delinquency hovered around, again, a 2% factor or so through the month of April, very similar. So, our customer base, even through the month of April, from a collection and payment standpoint, was consistent, even on a year-over-year basis. So, it\u2019s a mixture and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to again continue to react to. We\u2019ve got great tools to be nimble. We\u2019ve got great analytics to continue to address, again, whatever continues to surface or does surface that we need to address, and address through different tactics, strategies, et cetera. So, that would basically be an overview of how, again, we\u2019re looking at this environment, and clearly in a position that the predictability of it is still unknown. Jeff Spector : My second question then, if we could talk about the strength of the balance sheet and opportunities. I think, you discussed this quickly in your opening remarks. Are you seeing -- what are you seeing today? And how should we think about this? And how can PSA take advantage during this downturn verse? I think one of the regrets was not being a bit more aggressive during the world financial crisis. Joe Russell : Sure. Well, Tom can talk a little bit more specifically about the balance sheet as it stands today. So, I\u2019ll let him do that in a sec. But, again, looking at extreme cycles like this one is likely to be, there is evidence, it\u2019s very early, but it won\u2019t be surprising. If, again, a number of owners that have come into the sector, particularly over the last three or four years where we\u2019ve seen an abundance of new supply coming into the market, particularly with owners and ownership structures that may not be well suited to deal with something like this. There could be, again, a predictable fact, which would be more ability to capture assets, again, a price point that we think is very different and much more attractive than it\u2019s been over the last, say, three or four years. We\u2019re starting to hear, again, some rumblings around assets that I would say are underwater, where they\u2019ve been funded through a certain level of debt. And the valuations are below that value. And so, we\u2019re starting, again, to hear some of that out in the market. And, again, it\u2019s early, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to us. And the ability for us to in particular, take advantage of an environment that could create that additional level of transaction activity, the balance sheet is ready for it. And it\u2019s ready in a meaningful way. So, we\u2019ll see how that plays through. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Tom. And he can give you a little bit more color on where the balance sheet stands today. Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes. Balance sheet is in great shape, as we\u2019ve discussed on previous quarterly calls. And we\u2019re sitting right now with debt to EBITDA just to touch over 1 times, fixed charge coverage around 8 times, and over $700 million in cash on the balance sheet. So, we feel very good about our financial and liquidity position to take advantage of potential opportunity, should it arise. As Joe mentioned, we\u2019re starting to see the early signs of that. Jeff Spector : Thank you. I wish everyone well. Joe Russell : I appreciate, Jeff, you too. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys. Joe, Tom, I was wondering if you could just give a little more color on the trends and what happened in April in terms of occupancy and where you ended turnover move-in rents. And then it sounded like delinquencies were 2% for April and that was in line with last year. Was that right as well? Tom Boyle : Sure, Jeremy. I\u2019ll walk through a number of those points. It\u2019s Tom. So, stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-in, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it 5%, 10% on move-ins in January. In March, we saw a meaningful increase in demand, as customers pulled forward activity that would typically occur later in the second quarter, most notably college students, and others ahead of stay-at-home orders. One week in March, for instance, move-ins were up about 20% to give you context. But then, that volume started to decline significantly, as folks were encouraged to stay at home. Overall search volumes have come down. Inbound sales calls are down about 25% in April. Web visits are down about 7% in April. Overall move-in activity through the month of April was down 17%, despite decreases in rental rates of circa 20% to drive volume across the country. So, for those customers that have a storage need, we\u2019re providing space with enhanced precautions in our properties and utilizing our e-rental online lease. Somewhat encouraging, as Joe mentioned, over 80% of last year\u2019s seasonal activity we experienced in April, which speaks to demand for the product even in tough times. Trends modestly improved as we moved through April. So, last week of April, for instance, move-in volumes were down about 11%. But again, it reduced rental rates. Somewhat offsetting the decline in move-ins was an anticipated decline in move-outs. So, move-out volumes, not taking into account auction-related move-outs was down 9% in the month of April. We\u2019re watching this metric closely and anticipate that stay-at-home orders are lifted, we may see an increase in pent-up move-out volume. We\u2019ve talked about in the past that in 2009, there was a shift in consumer behavior with longer length of stay customers moving out. We have not seen that to date. Our existing tenants continue to perform well and move-outs remain down. As Joe mentioned, we have seen less overall activity of property, so not just move-ins and move-outs, but customer visits to the property. Our new centralized access system gives us insights into what\u2019s going on at the properties, and April activity was down about 20% versus March. In terms of occupancy, we ended the first quarter up about 60, 70 basis points in occupancy. As we disclosed, part of that was attributable to the fact that we had postponed auctions of delinquent customers. We\u2019ve continued to do that through the month of April. So, our occupancy at the end of April was up about 30 basis points. But, if you take into account the fact that we have some customers with us that we may have otherwise auctioned in prior years, our occupancy was down on a year-over-year basis. Still up seasonally on an absolute basis, but down on a year-over-year basis. Moving to collections, which is the third prong of your commentary. As noted in the press release and as Joe just highlighted, April rent collections were very consistent with prior year, and that is consistent with what we saw in 2009. We\u2019ve collected about 95% of our April rent at this point, which is right in line with where we were last year at this time. So, as the duration of this pandemic elongates and we react to where we go from here, could very likely put more pressure on the consumer. And we\u2019ll have to monitor that as we go forward. But at this point, collections are very much in line. Jeremy Metz : That\u2019s great color. And my second question, I\u2019m going to double up a little bit here. I just wanted to see, Tom, if you can expand a little more from what you see in April but kind of talk about it from a regional perspective. How\u2019s Texas performing, just given the fall off in energy, Southern California, given the closures, Florida, what about areas that are starting to reopen? What are you starting to see there? And then, just, if I could add on is just on the business customer side. It sounds like, they\u2019re pretty steady right now. But, when do you expect to start hearing from them and what sort of trajectory are you seeing there -- or would you foresee there? Thanks. Tom Boyle : So, there are regional trends that are worth speaking to. I think, the high level takeaway is that the Northeast has been more impacted. And we\u2019ve seen slower rates of move-ins in the Northeast, also slower rates of move-outs, but slower rates of move-ins. So, as you look at New York or Boston or Philadelphia, and really, you can expand that up and down the East Coast because that would put Miami probably in that category as well. Along the West Coast, move-in volumes have been more similar with prior years, still down, but down more in the 5% to 10% range in many of those markets versus higher in the northeast. And then that extends through the Southwest and into Texas. Houston is a market that certainly with the combination of the pandemic as well as with what\u2019s going on with oil prices, one that we and we suspect others are watching closely, we have seen move-in volumes hold up reasonably well in Houston, but we have cut rate in order to drive that volume more meaningfully in Houston than we have in other markets in Texas and the West Coast that I highlighted. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I know that the industry has kind of gone to a temporary hold on existing customer rent increases, which has really been kind of the single driver of revenue growth for the industry. I\u2019m just curious, what is the timetable on that. I assume that that\u2019s still in place for May. And how long do you think that that might be on hold for? Joe Russell : Sure. So, we thought it made sense and was appropriate to pause that program as we move through March. And we did not send existing tenant rate increases out for June 1st billing. So, that will continue through the second quarter. Stepping back, existing tenant rent increases in a more normal time, are managed at a very granular level, using data analytics to drive, what we send, when we send it and the magnitude. That will be an important part of where we go from here and how we restart at the appropriate time, recognizing that consumer behavior could be a little bit different, post this event than what it was before. But, we\u2019ll be using the same tools that we have in the past in order to determine those rental rate increases and the appropriate time with which to send them. Steve Sakwa : Yes. And Tom, just as a follow-up, is there something, is there a guidepost, is it about the amount of country that\u2019s open? I mean, what sort of guidepost should we be looking forward to kind of determine when those may be appropriate? Tom Boyle : Yes. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a number of different things. Certainly, the situations that are going on in the local economies, consumer behavior that we\u2019re seeing, and we\u2019ll react to a number of those things as we see them. At this point, we thought it prudent not to send them out at the end of April for June 1 effective. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. And you mentioned in the press release, increasing kind of hourly wages by $3 at least -- it sounded like at least for the second quarter. Maybe just talk about expenses overall. I think, maybe online marketing costs were still up. Just how are those trending and how do you expect employee costs to kind of trend through the balance of the year? Joe Russell : Yes. Steve, first on personnel-related expense. Yes, that\u2019ll be elevated through Q2, by virtue of the things that we\u2019ve discussed about. We put some information on that in the Q as well. And, again, we\u2019ll continue to moderate and understand, again, how we need to react to the overall environment going forward into the second half of the year. And we\u2019re looking at all expense levels across the Company as a whole. The burden of tax increases is still with us. We don\u2019t really have a way to predict that going one direction or another at the moment, other than that it\u2019s just continuing to be elevated. And Tom, can give you a little bit more color on another component of our expense tied to the advertising. So, again, that\u2019s been a vibrant tool for us. We\u2019re going to continue to use it aggressively. But, again, it\u2019s going to be a factor in the mix as well. We continue to look at all of our operational expenses, whether again, it\u2019s tied to vendor contracts, the amount of maintenance capital that we\u2019re putting into the portfolio, et cetera. So, it\u2019s definitely something that we continue to focus on and look for ways of, in this environment to optimizing overall cost levels. And, Tom, if you want to give a little bit more color on what we\u2019re doing with advertising and marketing spend? Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Joe. I\u2019d just briefly touch on that, because that\u2019s a lever that we pulled pretty hard through 2019 in the first quarter. And in the first quarter, like we saw last year, we saw pretty good demand response from that. And that\u2019s continued through in April. So, we\u2019re going to continue pushing pretty hard on advertising, as we continue to see a great response to the Public Storage brand, online. And so, we\u2019d anticipate that then remains somewhat elevated as we seek to drive volume to our website, call center and the properties. Operator : Your next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Todd Thomas : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the April trends. That information is helpful. It sounds like you haven\u2019t yet seen an increase in move-outs though. And I\u2019m just curious, if you look back at prior cycles -- and I realize this is a different environment than what you\u2019ve seen in prior cycles. But any sense, what kind of lag you might expect to see between job loss and move-outs? Tom Boyle : Sure. Todd, I think, looking back at 2009 as a guidepost, but 2009 was a different environment. And as I look at move-in, move-out trends in 2009, they were more gradual as they came on than what we\u2019ve seen to-date. So, to give you a context, we did see a material increase in move-outs. But as you look at the quarters in which they took place in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, the magnitude of those were in the mid-single-digits, which as you compare that to the orders of magnitude that we\u2019re seeing and the sharp decrease in move-ins and move-outs already at this juncture, given the pandemic, it\u2019s a different reaction, given the fact that folks are being encouraged to stay-at-home and we\u2019re all kind of awaiting scientific research and developments. So, I think it\u2019s hard to point back at that and say it\u2019s a perfect analog, to be honest. But, it did happen with increased move-outs pretty quickly on the back of declines in employment in the fourth quarter of 2008. I think, one of the biggest drivers now is not just job loss, as it relates to move-outs, but it\u2019s also the fact that there are customers who are staying at home and maybe don\u2019t want to come visit our properties to move out right now, because they feel good about the safety and security of their goods at our properties. So, we\u2019ll see where we go from here. But, your point that you made is the right one, which is we have not seen any noticeable shift to-date and in fact move-ins -- move-outs are down. Todd Thomas : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, the rent reductions for new move-in customers that you mentioned, Tom, I think 20%, is that across the platform on average? And can you talk about whether or not you anticipate needing to change pricing going forward here, based on, either call volumes or site visits and just I guess rentals and conversions overall? Tom Boyle : Yes, sure. We do actively manage our pricing on a day-to-day basis across the country at a unit size and property level basis. And so, as you would expect, my comments around volumes being different by region, pricing strategy is different by region as well. And so, there\u2019s some regions in the country where pricing is only down, call it 5% year-over-year, and there\u2019s others where pricing is down 30%. And so, there\u2019s a good mix there. And we\u2019re managing that dynamically in order to drive both, volume as well as revenue outcome. Todd Thomas : Okay. But normally in the peak leasing season, there would be a few large net move-in months in a row. You\u2019d be raising rates, right? So, you\u2019re discounting and lowering rents here. Do you expect to be able to begin to take that pressure off a little bit and be able to move rents higher on a seasonal basis at all throughout the spring and summer months? Tom Boyle : Well, I think, looking at last year as a guidepost is probably thrown out the window. We manage our pricing, advertising, promotion strategies on a realtime basis at all times regardless of what\u2019s going on. And certainly, we\u2019re reacting to different signals that are coming in this year than what we saw last year. Your point on seasonality, we\u2019ve already seen an impact to the seasonality to-date, which is the college students that with college going to e-learning and shutting down physical presence in the month of March, we saw that activity pull forward. As we move into the month of May and June, you\u2019d have other seasonal use cases that would come up. Whether we see those this year, I think is to be determined and may very well differ materially by region and jurisdiction, given how things are managed with stay-at-home orders this year. So, I think it\u2019s too early to comment too much on what seasonality may play out through the second and third quarters. But, we\u2019ll be managing real time as we always do. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to just ask you, going back to the compensation increases that you put in place for the second quarter, and you noted that you might extend them. And I was just wondering, if the decision around potentially extending them to do with shutdowns and disruption from this pandemic, or is it more just a reflection of kind of competition for that level of worker at the property level or kind of I guess what are the issues that would help you make that decision? Joe Russell : Yes, Smedes. Yes. I wouldn\u2019t take that as we intend to do any of the things you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s really, we felt comfortable in the near term that the range of issues that our employee base was facing, we thought the right thing to do was to elevate their level of overall compensation and other tools they had at their disposal that we could help fund, whether it was childcare or extended time off, et cetera. So, again, because of the unpredictability going into the second half of this year, and frankly, even for the rest of this quarter, I mean, we\u2019ll see how things go. I\u2019ll tell you though that the variety of wage rates we have nationally is something that we constantly do evaluate, we look at again the relative pay for the scope and the applicability of skill for the type of compensation that we have, and we think we\u2019re aligned in that regard. And again, that\u2019s just something that we\u2019ll continue to be fluid. Clearly one of the things that we have the ability to do and we clearly thought it was the right thing to do was to, again, give additional support to our frontline workers in particular, as I mentioned in my opening comments a critical part of our overall operational strategies and taking care of customers, et cetera. So it\u2019s just something that will continue to evaluate, again, in an environment that has a lot of unpredictability, even around the way even some of the stimulus packages are working and other things that are at everybody\u2019s potential access, but at the same time, knowing that we have the ability to give additional support and we thought it was the right thing to do. Smedes Rose : Yes. That makes sense. Thank you. I mean, the other thing I just want to ask you for the behavior -- or sort of pricing behavior of facilities that are still in lease-up. Has PSA taken a more aggressive approach on rates there, just to kind of gain, whatever kind of market share there is available or what\u2019s happened, I guess, specifically at those properties versus your stabilized assets? Joe Russell : Yes. Smedes, those properties continue to lease up. We have reacted to the new pricing environment and have lowered pricing on many of those as well. But, again, depending on the level of volume and interest going on in those individual markets, it\u2019s around the trade areas of those properties. But they\u2019ve continued to lease up through the month of April, which we\u2019re encouraged by, albeit at lower pricing. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Joe Russell : Great, thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey. Good morning out there. First off, thanks for the outlook commentary in yesterday\u2019s release. I found it to be very helpful. Could you just remind us of your average length of stay, which I believe is a bit higher than your appears? And do you think that makes them more or less price sensitive to renewal rate increases whenever those are, of course, slated to resume? Tom Boyle : Sure, our average length of stay is right around 10 months. And that\u2019s really a barbell between some customers that have use cases for storage that are very short-term in nature, be it between apartments et cetera. And those customers that are using the space for longer term needs, be it a storing seasonal goods, businesses, an extension of folks\u2019 homes et cetera. And in terms of sensitivity to rate increases, there\u2019s a lots of different factors that play into that, stickiness of customers, once you get past really that one year mark is quite sticky. And that\u2019s remained the case through the month of April. And we\u2019ll have to evaluate what consumer behavior may change and business behavior may change as we move through navigating this pandemic. But at this point, no changes. Jonathan Hughes : Maybe another -- maybe a similar question. I mean, what percentage of your customers have been there for over a year and over two years? Tom Boyle : Yes. About 60% of our customers, a little less than 60% of our customers have been with us for longer than a year and a little over 40% of our customers have been with us for longer than two. Jonathan Hughes : And what percentage of those are on AutoPay? Tom Boyle : Yes. A good percentage -- AutoPay for us is around 50% of the tenant base. We haven\u2019t seen any change in AutoPay signups or any cancellation trends. It\u2019s very consistent. Jonathan Hughes : I\u2019m going to sneak in one more. Have you looked at expanding the size of your credit facility to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, or do you feel you have enough capacity with free cash flow, and what\u2019s your cash and revolver capacity for any opportunities you pursue? Tom Boyle : Yes, sure. I think, we feel very good about our current liquidity with over $700 million in cash on the balance sheet, entirely undrawn revolver and access to capital markets, given our uniquely low leverage and high coverage. And so, we feel very good about the firepower we have in order to fund potential opportunities. And we await that opportunity in the next several quarters. Operator : Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Just a couple of quick ones. Thanks for the disclosure. I thought that was very helpful. The first is just, can you just talk about maybe sort of the small business tenant in the portfolio? Just high level, sort of where the exposure and how are they faring in this environment, to the extent that you can? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, small business customers are a component of our tenant base. They typically are good paying customers as it relates to collections and that\u2019s continued through the month of April. And the one notable trend I would highlight is, we have seen a decrease in move-in volume more pronounced for business customers than we have for individual consumers, particularly over the last four weeks. So, that\u2019s not surprising in this environment, given the fact that many businesses are not open and operational and folks are being encouraged to stay-at-home. So, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything concerning there, but we have seen a decline in move-in volume more so. Ronald Kamdem : And what percent is the business customer of the portfolio? Tom Boyle : Yes. So, there\u2019s a variety of different businesses that use our space. We have about 5%, 6% of customers that are true businesses that sign business leases with us. And then, we have appreciably more customers that are business users that by survey indicate something, more like 15%, 20% of our customer base, which is sales reps and others that use our space. And those customers -- so, yes, that gives you a sense of the composition. Ronald Kamdem : Very helpful. Just another quick one. Just looking at late charges and administrative fees, just saw it was down 3.5% year-over-year. Is there a thought, either this go round or did you do this last cycle as well in terms of trying to deal with customers and potentially waiving some late fees or is there sort of no change in strategy there? Tom Boyle : Yes, sure. So, one of the things that we did was provide some incremental customer accommodation for those impacted by the pandemic. And I would highlight that our operational teams have dealt with crisis situations over the past several years and are well-equipped to deal with situations that materially impact local communities. And so, while that\u2019s historically happened in very tight geographies, in this case, it really happened across the country, but our operational team pivoted to that stance very quickly and effectively. And so, we are, waiving fees, reducing rent in some instances and working with delinquent customers across the country for those impacted by the COVID pandemic. We already talked about the fact that we\u2019ve paused auctions and existing tenant rate increases as well, but I\u2019ve been really impressed by our operation team\u2019s ability to move into crisis mode and to help those that have been impacted to-date. And that is a driver of some of the fees that you highlight, and would expect that to be the case as we move through the second quarter as well. Ronald Kamdem : Great. One more if I may. I just was noticing that -- I think Minneapolis was -- looked like it was additive in the Q this quarter in terms of markets you called with supply, hopefully I got that right. But, could you just maybe provide a little bit more color or maybe what\u2019s happening there to warrant that call out? Joe Russell : Yes. Sure, Ronald. Minneapolis is a market that, first of all, we have significant market share and presence. So, over the last two years, we\u2019ve boosted that by doing three things. We\u2019ve added to our own portfolio through acquisitions, ground up development and redevelopment in a market that we hadn\u2019t actually had a lot of investment activity in for some time. We like and see I think very good long-term traction relative to the market itself and the additional inventory and new properties that we put into that market. All told, for us directly is about 10,000 units. And lease-up there is going well on the new properties. We\u2019re not seeing a like-for-like additional magnitude of new development going in the market, but there\u2019s some. But, we felt it was relevant to call it out because, again, our same-store is not progressing as well as some other markets have been in the near-term. But, we feel like the stabilization that will take place over the next one to two years as, again, we see good absorption of the new product and any of the things that are happening in our existing properties correct as well. So, again, the market is I think well-poised for future growth. And we\u2019re really pleased with the additive scale and the range of new assets, either directly built and/or acquired that we put into that market. Ryan Burke : It\u2019s Ryan Burke. We do have a number of analysts left that want to ask questions. So, please do try to keep it to two and then feel free to jump back in queue. Ronald Kamdem : Sure, thanks. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thanks, Ronald. Operator : Your next question is from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi. Thanks. Just to flash out that rent relief question that you may offer tenants, if they ask. Is it deferred, is it the expectation that you\u2019ll receive it later on? Maybe just trying to flush that out, is it a maintenance -- ability to maintain occupancy, so you\u2019ll give a rent holiday? How are you looking at that? Tom Boyle : Yes. I would say, first off, it\u2019s been a relatively modest amount of requests that have come in for things like that. We have a little bit of a different business than many other real estate asset types that may have long term leases and may be talking about blend and extends and things like that. We have month to month leases. So, as we think about customers and their rent and navigating this environment, obviously one of the choices that customers have is they have the ability to move out. And so, extending payment plans or otherwise are a little bit less applicable for our product type than others. But, we have a variety of different tools to work with customers impacted by this pandemic. Todd Stender : Right, understood. And then, how about your stance on share buybacks, as you look at the stock come inside of maybe our NAV estimate. Are you looking at putting cash to work, should the stock decline? Tom Boyle : Sure. Stock buybacks are something that one, we have authorization from the Board to undertake; and two, it\u2019s part of our regular capital allocation dialogue. We are hopeful and optimistic that this pandemic could create a different business environment and different acquisition pricing environment, which could allow us to use our balance sheet to grow the portfolio in an attractive manner. And we will see how that plays out. And in addition to that, stock buybacks are another tool that we have to allocate capital. At this point, we have not bought back in stock. Todd Stender : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. I just want to verify a couple comments you guys made earlier. You said April -- at the end of April, occupancy was up 30 basis points, but that included some units that were -- haven\u2019t been auctioned off yet. So, if you look at it, maybe from a paying occupancy standpoint, how does April look year-over-year? Tom Boyle : Well, we finished April down about 40, 50 basis points in occupancy, if you take out those units that may have been auctioned in the previous year. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And in terms of move-in rates, you ended the first quarter down 4.2%. How did that trend in April? Tom Boyle : Yes. Ki Bin, I\u2019ve already commented on that in terms of the range of different move-in rates by different markets, on average. It\u2019s down around 20%. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Sorry. I was confused about volume versus rate. All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Mike Mueller : In terms of the planned capital spending that you talked about the case for property upgrades and everything. Is there going to be any disruption to that or any notable change to the budgeted amounts? Tom Boyle : So, yes, Mike, we obviously reset that from what we spoke to a quarter ago where we were looking at something along the lines of $250 million or so. And we have reset that to about $175 million. So, there\u2019s some things in the mix there that have led to the reduction. One is, a number of the capital projects that we launched into 2019 carried into this year along with some of our strategic investments around what we call our Property of Tomorrow initiative. We\u2019ve tapered that down knowing that we\u2019re going to be looking at delays from -- and approval and/or permitting basis in one regard through the next few months, based on what we\u2019re seeing at the moment, as cities have shut down many of their own staffing levels and/or sets of approvals that come through when you\u2019re doing work along those lines, coupled with the fact that we think we\u2019re going to go into a much more beneficial arena, even for bidding and continuing from a scale standpoint, the transition of properties to our Gen 5 standard that the Property of Tomorrow programs align with. So, that was one component. A number of other things that also we were intending to do through this year, not in any way related to functionality of properties or anything else, but it just makes sense based on availability and predictability of not only vendor effectiveness but even from a cost standpoint, we think we\u2019re going to be much better suited to do more of that going into 2021. On the flip side of that, we still are anticipating about $175 million that will happen this year. And it ties to things that we will continue to do as we always do, keeping our properties highly functional, doing repairs, doing everything that we can to facilitate high degree of customer move-ins and high occupancy. We also still are doing a few things that vendor friction aside that we think we can still do in this environment that would also relate to upgrades to LED and energy efficiency. We\u2019re putting solar on a number of properties. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s led to the reset on our expectation for 2020. Operator : Your next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisor. Spenser Allaway : Actually, all of my questions have been asked. Thank you. Joe Russell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Parker Decraene with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here. So, just a couple of questions. The first is more strategic. This pandemic is going to change the way we live, work and play, both in the near-term, but certainly over a longer term. Have you given thought about the live part of it in? And if there is going to be a shift of population out of urban dense cities into more suburban house living, even a modest shift, but it could certainly accelerate, how does that change the dynamics of demand for your product? Joe Russell : Yes. Michael, we\u2019ll see how that does play through. Obviously, we have the benefit with 2,500 locations, 38 states. We\u2019ve got a sizeable portfolio of both urban and suburban related. It\u2019s too soon to tell yet, if one is being benefited versus the other. So, we\u2019ll assess that and see what kinds of trends might play through just on, again, how the population shifts one direction or another from, as you mentioned, a pure urban desirability to something that maybe more desirable from a suburban standpoint. But, don\u2019t know yet. But, we\u2019ve got plenty of tentacles out there as we continue to see the type of impact that this environment may create in that regard. It\u2019s not coming through yet meaningful, other than Tom mentioned that we have seen a little bit more of a impact in the Northeast, and I think you can make sense of that really more from a health standpoint and a science standpoint, because that\u2019s frankly where the most dramatic impact to the COVID virus has been so far. And again, many of those communities are in major lockdowns. So, we\u2019ll see. And we play in both arenas very actively, continually as we speak. We\u2019re making development decisions, both in suburban and urban markets. We use a lot of demographic data to point us even on a very micro basis where to locate and invest in properties, where we think we can continue to see good demand. Michael Bilerman : And I think about the shift that you made into some extraordinary larger facilities in more urban markets. Is there anything you can glean from those during this pandemic yet? Tom Boyle : It\u2019s tough. Michael, it\u2019s really tough to isolate what longer term trends will be based on the last six weeks that we\u2019ve been navigating this pandemic. Because I think the bigger driver of activity over the past 6 weeks has been people dealing with this crisis and navigating it both for their personal use as well as for their business. And I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s indicative of what the longer term impact, to your point to that could be 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 years down the road as it relates to customers\u2019 affinity towards urban living versus suburban or ex-urb living. The last 6 weeks wouldn\u2019t point to anything notable, and they\u2019ve been a very unique 6 weeks in our history. Joe Russell : Yes. And I think, the other thing is, again the reason, we think through and design and either build or invest in our larger assets, whether again, they\u2019re in urban or suburban markets is, it\u2019s highly correlated to again demographic data, which is both, population based and it\u2019s competitive based. So, some of our very largest properties even through the last few weeks are doing just as well as they\u2019ve done historically. Michael Bilerman : Right. Joe Russell : So, it\u2019s way too soon to tell. Michael Bilerman : And then, second question is just in terms of operations, and thank you for the detail on the Q in the press release. Can you talk about same-store NOI being negative for the rest of the year, given the pressures on revenues and certainly the investments you\u2019re making in your employee base and to keep your facility safe and clean, and so about the revenue and expense impact? If you look to the last two recessions that we\u2019ve gone through, in the early 2000s, same-store NOI cost in the self-storage sector was down high--single-digits year-over-year basis. If you go back to the \u201809, \u201810\u2019s timeframe, it was down 4 to 6% on a quarterly -- year-over-year basis. How should we -- what type of goalposts should investors think about in terms of the rate of decline? I think, you talked about it will be a much quicker impact to your business than the prior recessions, just given all these stay-at-home orders and a complete halt in the economy. Should we be gearing up for a high-single-digit, maybe even a double-digit decline given a expense drag? Is that where our mind should be at by the end of the year? Joe Russell : Well, Michael, first of all, you know well, we don\u2019t guide, even in \u201cnormal times\u201d. And it\u2019s the crystal ball. I mean, we clearly don\u2019t know what direction this could play through. You\u2019re right. I mean, it has been a severe and very dramatic change, jobless claims are down at 30 million. I mean, that\u2019s a massive shock to the entire economy. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take for that to correct. I don\u2019t know how long it will play through, what kind of impact it could have on our broad customer base, and GDP growth is going to be ugly from a predictability standpoint, this quarter in particular. So, we\u2019ll see. Tom Boyle : Yes. And Michael, you obviously point to the right historical benchmarks, but I\u2019m not sure that they\u2019re really analogous to my points earlier and to Joe\u2019s comments. So, we provided some line by line detail as to what we\u2019re seeing at this point. As we move forward through 2020, a lot of what we see will be driven by science and political decisions of which is difficult to underwrite. And, we try to provide you the color and the context around what the drivers are, but we\u2019ll see as we go from here. Michael Bilerman : Yes. No, I know, you don\u2019t provide guidance and that\u2019s why I said, I appreciate the details and taking all the questions on the call about impact. You did put out there a negative number. I just didn\u2019t know whether you could at least goalpost a little bit about how negative. Well, that\u2019s what I was just trying to frame. Joe Russell : Yes. For eight quarters, it\u2019s kind of between 1% and 2%, so. Tom Boyle : Right. Yes. So revenue growth is between 1% and 2% for the last eight quarters. And I think over that last eight quarters, same-store NOI has probably been -- with maybe the exception of third quarter last year, between 0% and 1%. Joe Russell : Yes. Tom Boyle : So, certainly we\u2019re not in that environment that we were in over the last eight quarters. We\u2019re seeing a decline in move-in volumes. Our existing tenants are performing well at this point, but we remain to see where they go from here. And collections have been solid in April. Michael Bilerman : Yes. Thanks for the time. Joe Russell : Great. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey. Just one quick follow-up. Joe and Tom, you guys both commented earlier on capital allocations, you mentioned acquisitions. You had a question about stock buybacks in there somewhere. I was just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the marginal dollar there versus reinvesting in your existing portfolio, just given the pullback that we saw outlined in the Q for the CapEx program. Joe Russell : Yes. Jeremy, like always, as Tom alluded to, I mean, that\u2019s -- stock buyback is in and of itself from a capital allocation decisions, something that, again, has always been an alternative. We\u2019ll continue to assess it. I couldn\u2019t at this point guide you to, okay, where\u2019s it stack ranker, how are we benchmarking it against, other uses of capital at the moment. The thing that\u2019s on the horizon, likely, though, that we\u2019ve already talked to is, with the potential impact to a number of owners that have put anywhere from say 1,500 to 2,000 properties collectively into our sector over the last three to four years, a lot of those investments are not going to come close to the pro forma expectations or underwriting hurdles that they had put forth. So, we would anticipate but we\u2019ll see that like other big corrections that this too will lead to an opportunity for us to allocate capital that direction, but to be determined. So, we\u2019ve got a variety of different capital allocation options, and we\u2019ll continue to assess them as this thing plays through. Jeremy Metz : Yes. No, that\u2019s right. I think, I was just trying to think through high-grading the portfolio externally versus focusing on the internal, which you guys have made a big priority in recent years. So, I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Joe Russell : Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Ryan Burke for any closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We certainly hope the best for everyone as we continue to manage through this interesting environment. Joe Russell : Thanks, all. Stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Maria. And thanks to all of you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m here on the line of Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 6, 2020. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on the call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. As usual, we do ask that you keep your questions limited to two. After you ask two, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan. And thanks for joining us today. Before I open the call for questions, I would first like to acknowledge and thank the full Public Storage team along with our customers and business partners as we have come together to ensure a safe environment. In the last four months during this pandemic, we have moved in over 400,000 new customers, as we continue to operate our entire 2,500 property portfolio. Clearly, this volume of activity has been a validation of the strength of our platform and the resiliency of self-storage. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. Joe, maybe I\u2019ll start the first question just on that point, as you mentioned, the volume is very strong and the results were better in the quarter I think than initially expected, if we compare comments to the last call. But, at the same time, I know your team is cautious on the second half of the year. I guess, can you tie those comments together? Joe Russell : Sure, Jeff. Yes. There\u2019s no question, as I noted, that we\u2019ve been very determined and focused on the amount of volume we\u2019ve been able to pull into the portfolio, coupled with obviously a number of crosscurrents. So, if you step back and think about the last four months during the pandemic, we kind of think of going through four different phases. And the early part of the pandemic, March and April, we did a number of things to ensure all the right safety protocols, we suspended auctions and really made sure that our entire environment was safe and secure as we were able to continue to operate all of our properties. We saw a little bit of degradation in demand, after an initial rush that came to us through primarily college and university shutting down early. So, we saw a bit of a rush. But then, not long after that, we started to see a bit of degradation. But then, going into the next phase, the second phase, we began to put even more focus on customer focus. We again suspended auctions and we opened up to a degree some of the customer accommodation practices again to be reflective of the environment. And we became more focused on different tools around top of funnel demand through advertising and other things that were proving to be actually quite effective. So, we started to see the residual benefit of that, and again a lift in demand and move in volume. In that phase, again, we continued along those same lines but continue to put even more focus on the ways in which we were able to draw new customers to the portfolio, while month after month seeing a very positive impact from far fewer move outs. And then finally, the most recent phase as we stand through the month of July, we\u2019ve actually now gone back to auctions. We have reinstituted rent increases in many parts of the portfolio. And again, we\u2019re starting to see very good reaction to the amount of activity, both on move-ins and lack of or lower move-outs. So, speaking to the second half of the year, yes, we do see a number of different pressures that I\u2019ll have Tom walk you through in a little bit more detail. But overall, as I noted, we\u2019ve been very pleased by the overall resiliency and the ability on our part to continue to drive this level of demand, and literally we are dealing with in many markets record high levels of occupancy. Tom, why don\u2019t you give a little bit more color on second half of the year? Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Joe. So, as Joe mentioned, operating metrics, we started to improve as we moved through the second quarter and have continued that post-quarter. So, we can spend more time there, if you like. But, I think part of your question was around the discussion around same-store revenue trends. So, how do those operating metrics translate to financial metrics and while operating metrics improve throughout the second quarter, financial metrics, we saw revenue growth in the same store pool deteriorate. So, if you think about the second quarter in aggregate into components, same store occupancy was up about 20 basis points, same store rents were down 2%. So, that leads you to your negative 1.8% performance for rental income in the same store pool in the second quarter. Fee collections were down 32% in the quarter. Those fee collections were down for two primary reasons. Earlier in the quarter, it related to customer accommodations and customers\u2019 requesting fee relief. And so, we did grant, the vast majority of those requests. But collections frankly were quite good through the quarter. And so, as we moved through the second quarter, our fee collections were lower year-over-year on about a 30% basis because customers were paying us sooner. And we anticipate that\u2019s likely to continue. At least we\u2019ve seen it continue through July at this point, which is leading to lower fee collections. So, that was the second quarter. As we think about the other component of your question around the second half, I just highlighted that rents were down 2% in the second quarter on average. We ended the quarter down 3.1% on contract rents. So, clearly, we\u2019re starting the third quarter in a lower year-over-year rent growth position. And we\u2019re still seeing fee collections lower because of good collections. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Very helpful. I guess my one follow-up then, just to confirm, but are we seeing that the second half you think could be worse than 2Q? I think, that\u2019s where I\u2019m a bit confused. Because this seems like\u2026 Tom Boyle : We highlighted in the MD&A and the 10-Q, which is we think it\u2019s likely that the second half will have same-store revenue performance worse than the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to -- I was interested that you talked about in your Q that bad debt expense was in line to historic levels. Does that just tie into what you just talked about or are you granting feel relief, so customers don\u2019t necessarily kind of fall into a bad debt category, or is there just something maybe I\u2019m just not understanding correctly? Joe Russell : No. I think, it\u2019s really pretty simple. Collection trends through the quarter were good. We had customers that were paying us earlier. We did have customers that while we had auctions paused for a period of time, stayed with us for a longer period of time. We\u2019ve begun to work through that during the quarter. And so, right now, we\u2019re sitting with about 20 basis points of occupancy that is delayed auction activities. But, as you think about bad debt through the quarter, it was pretty consistent year-over-year. And frankly, as we sit here today, away from what was written off in the second quarter, the receivable, as we ended the quarter, was actually down a little year-over-year. Smedes Rose : Okay. Joe Russell : Stepping back, it\u2019s obviously a focus of the team to focus on basics through the quarter, rent spaces and collecting rent. And I think, you saw a good customer reaction and validation that our spaces are important to them. And we saw a good team activity and rental activity. I think, there is also broader things that work. There\u2019s no question that government stimulus or government support for many individuals throughout the economy, we suspect helped our collection trends through the quarter. And as we look across industries, credit cards or otherwise, many other industries are seeing similar collection trends as the government has done a good bit to support individuals\u2019 finances. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks. And then, just as a follow-up. You continue to make acquisitions and see things that you\u2019ve -- that you\u2019re purchasing. Just wondering if you could just speak to what\u2019s I guess compelling about the opportunities, is it cap rates, is it just the ability to manage it better, or kind of what are you sort of seeing now maybe versus kind of pre-pandemic, I guess, on your acquisition activity? Joe Russell : Yes. Sure, Smedes. There\u2019s no question, at the beginning of the pandemic, investment market on many fronts basically went into pause mode. We had, again, in the March and April timeframe, a handful of assets that had been already badded, we still thought they were very attractive investments for us to make. We closed on those deals toward the earlier part of the quarter. And then, things settled down. We actually began to see and continue through today a bit of an elevation of return to market and/or just conversations that we had in motion prior to the pandemic, a variety of different deals that continue to be particularly attractive. So, for the most part, the types of assets that are commanding normal or consistent cap rates, pre-pandemic, would be stabilized assets. There\u2019s still a lot of capital on the sidelines without looking for those types of investments. What we\u2019ve done alternatively is look for, again, value opportunities, particularly around assets that may not be stabilized and/or in parts of our markets that we think round out our presence. So, we are seeing a little bit more opening up of owners that are coming back to the market, some of which do not see a way to basically get out of some of the constraints. They may be under for either lending reasons or not making the yields that they had expected. And those conversations are becoming more vibrant, I\u2019ll tell you that. And with that we\u2019ve got, again, as we pointed to in the press release, we\u2019ve got, a few assets that are in motion. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll probably see more. There still are very few bigger portfolios on the market today. We are also seeing, maybe no surprise, a few more land holding opportunities coming up as well, where again, owners that have taken down positions and land maybe have taken them through various stages of entitlements that are not again seeing the pro forma and return expectations come through, particularly with what\u2019s going on with rates across most markets, are looking for a way to come out of those positions. So, the acquisition team is busy looking at many different types of opportunities. And we\u2019ll see how this continues to play for us in the coming quarters. Smedes Rose : Great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the resumed rate increases. Can you perhaps just quantify or provide more color around what percent of the portfolio has now seen rate increases and whether they have been to the same degree that you would have sent out to existing customers pre-COVID? Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Spenser. This is Tom. So, as Joe mentioned, we did pause existing tenant rate increases for the second quarter. They did resume on July 1st. And we resumed it really on a test basis on July 1st and have since more broadly resumed on August 1st and expect to on September 1st as well. In terms of the breadth of it across the country, those increases are broadly spread throughout the country. So, in the vast majority of the country, we\u2019re able to send existing tenant rate increases. The magnitude of them compared to prior years though is lower. And we did that on a test basis on July 1st to try to understand consumer behavior during the pandemic, and we saw encouraging trends there. But, as we look forward, there are headwinds to sending the same sorts of increases as we did in prior years, really related to state and local jurisdictions and the price-related regulations there. And so, we would anticipate that the magnitude of the increases will be lower on a year-over-year basis for the next several months or longer, depending on how long those regulations stay in place. Spenser Allaway : Perfect. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Good morning. Thank you. Can I just ask a follow-up on that rate increase? What percentage were accepted, and if you could maybe provide some ground there around the average increase? Tom Boyle : Yes, sure. In terms of the percentage of those accepted, I\u2019m not going to get into details there. But I would say on a year-over-year basis, we saw good trends there as it relates to acceptance and continued rental activity with Public Storage. In terms of the magnitudes, typically I\u2019ve highlighted that, upper single-digits to 10% type increases. This year, we\u2019re averaging a little bit below that because of the things I just highlighted for Spenser. So, on average, a little bit lower than that. John Kim : And then, you mentioned, the revenue decline being more pronounced in the second half of the year. I\u2019m wondering if you could also provide commentary on the expenses side, and if you can, any potential savings from either marketing or other variable costs? Joe Russell : Yes. I\u2019ll begin with part of what you saw in the second quarter, we had elevated payroll cost that was tied to our PS Cares Fund where we were again boosting pay rate within our hourly employee ranks as well as providing a number of different accommodations reflective of the environment to support costs tied to childcare, more opportunity to take PTO, and again, look at the different opportunities or challenges that the workforce at large was dealing with. So, the pay rate increase did end at the end of the second quarter. So, you\u2019ll see some moderation down and the elevated cost of payroll, which was about 20% in the second quarter. And then, we\u2019ll also, as you see, be looking at lower taxes potentially because we saw property taxes come in lower at about 3.6% in the second quarter. And then, the other thing that we\u2019re going to keep an eye on is the cost of advertising and promotions with the remaining -- rest of the year. Tom Boyle : Yes. And I\u2019d just highlight that there\u2019s pretty good line by line details in the MD&A and our 10-Q. But we would anticipate the growth moderates from the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Just going back to the existing customer rate increase program, I mean, it\u2019s my understanding that if you stop that program for three months, it really doesn\u2019t make a big impact, right? If you stop it for a prolonged period of time, that\u2019s when it starts to bleed into results and you start to see a bigger impact. So, I\u2019m just curious, like, what was the lack of contribution, if you will, in the second quarter from stopping that program, and how should that change going forward? Joe Russell : Sure. Taking a step back, pausing on existing tenants for any month will have a meaningful impact on in-place rents. And so as we paused throughout the second quarter, there was a cumulative impact of several months of not sending existing tenant increases. As I highlighted, not only did we not send those during the second quarter, when we resent them and are sending increases in the second half, they are at lower magnitudes, given some of the regulations and things that we\u2019re doing to be mindful of the environment. So, as you think about the contribution to second quarter rental rate trends that you saw that on average rent per occupied square foot was down 2% in the second quarter, the largest component of that decline from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter was really no or very little contribution from existing tenant rate increase. Rest of it was rent roll down, which we disclosed our move-in and move-out trends throughout the second quarter, which also were clearly contributing factors, particularly early on in the quarter. Ki Bin Kim : And in terms of looking forward, that should moderate, I\u2019m assuming, because you\u2019re sending letter out again, even though at a lower rate? Joe Russell : Yes. We shouldn\u2019t have the same level of rental rate declines from existing tenants because we will be sending them out. Ki Bin Kim : And just going back to the late fees and admin charges that were down, I think 30% or so year-over-year. Can you just give a little more color on what those fees are? Is it just late fees? And I\u2019m assuming if operations start to return back to normal, that segment probably should normalize pretty quickly, or am I missing something? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, the different components of the late charges and administrative fees break down into several components. One is administrative fees that are charged at move-in. And so, that line item will trend based on move-in volumes. And you\u2019ve seen that over time, if move-in volumes are down, you\u2019re going to see those admin fees be a little bit down. So, we did see that in the second quarter. The other charges are related to late and then lien and lien sale fees, the largest component of it being late fees. So, if a customer doesn\u2019t pay their rent on time, a fee is charged to their account. That\u2019s where we saw improving collection trends reduced the amount of fees collected as we move through the quarter. I would say that down 32% in fees collected actually remained somewhat consistent through the second quarter and into July. But the composition of the driver changed as we moved through the quarter. In the month of April, in the first part of May, the majority of the driver there was fee accommodation, customers requesting fee relief. I shared on the last call that during the month of April, we had about 7% of our customers request some sort of customer accommodation, either rent or fee relief. The majority of that was fee relief and the majority of that was granted. As we moved through the quarter, the amount of requests that we received diminished and collection trends improved, such that by the time we got into June that down 30% in fee collections was driven primarily by better collection trends. And that\u2019s continued through July. In terms of how much into the future we can anticipate the fee trends will remain that way. It\u2019s hard to call. You would have asked us in March, whether collections would be meaningfully better year-over-year as we move through the quarter. And I don\u2019t think I would have sat here and told you that. But now, having seen it for a number of months and seen it through the month of July and good trends, even as we get into August here, it does feel like it\u2019s part of the environment. And as I highlighted, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s bigger factors there at work. And so, it\u2019s certainly a potential driver of lower same store revenues in the second half, because we continue to see it play out through the third quarter. Joe Russell : And just even again a little bit more perspective, Ki Bin, as Tom said, through the quarter and even through July that level of customer request has continued to diminish, coupled with fact customers are paying on time. So, the customer behavior through the pandemic has actually been quite strong. And it validates the way in which our platform has been well-tuned to not only address an environment like this, but it\u2019s been able to optimize the collection process as a whole? Tom Boyle : Yes. And I think, clearly, lower fee collections isn\u2019t a great thing from a same-store revenue standpoint, but it\u2019s a great thing for the shape of our customers in the business and validates the demand for self-storage as well as the customers\u2019 value in using our space. Ki Bin Kim : Right? I mean, no one can argue that people are paying on time, and yes less late fees as a bad thing. So, I\u2019m assuming then -- that\u2019s a good thing, right? So, I\u2019m assuming that there is kind of the mix of that fee structure that lower year-over-year is now the signup fee, the administrative fee, that\u2019s probably lower, right, or making a bigger impact? Tom Boyle : It\u2019s that late fee, it is customers paying us on time, and we\u2019re seeing that in through July and August. Joe Russell : One other thing to add is, auction activity, as I mentioned through the phases, we had paused on auction activity for a chunk of the second quarter. We are doing auctions again. We do have a few municipalities where we\u2019re being held back. But, our auction overhang is actually quite limited. It accounts for only about 20 basis points of our overall occupancy. So that too talks to the way that we continue to be optimized around our entire collection process, our customer engagement process. And we've been able to calibrate that very efficiently, even in an environment where there's been a number of hurdles that had limited us, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, to do auctions. And we are basically back in the auction business in many parts of the portfolio. We're certainly abiding by areas where we're unable to do auctions, but the meaningful chunk of that part of our business has returned. Tom Boyle : And maybe Ki Bin, I'll just grasp onto that to provide with the real benefit of that is as we move through the quarter, it really allowed us to re-rent that space as we got it back. And so as we moved through the quarter, we spoke about earlier around how average occupancy was up about 20 basis points. We ended the quarter up 50 basis points and again, that aged delinquency really represented about 20 basis points there. So call it up 30 basis points on a net basis. That's really continued to improve and at July 31, our occupancy was up 140 basis points. And again, about 20 basis points of impact of delayed auction activity. So net, up about 120 basis points in occupancy. And that's really related to the operating trends that Joe highlighted as we move through the different phases and improving trends and move-ins and continued lower move-outs, coupled with the fact that our delinquencies process was underway, allowed us to re-rent that space and move occupancy higher as we move through July. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just two quick ones from me. One is just trying to get a better understanding. We're hearing a lot about migration out of urban into sort of the suburban areas with the pandemic, whereas a little bit less density. And the question is really, are you seeing sort of anything in your portfolio that would suggest that's true? So our properties maybe better in sort of more suburban markets and they\u2019re seeing better activity than say your New York, or California, or something like that? Joe Russell : Ron, it's too soon to really tell if there's going to be a material and longstanding shift around suburban versus urban. We track by both areas. We look at density from a population standpoint how our properties are performing. You mentioned New York. Ironically, at the moment, New York\u2019s actually has been a huge beneficiary of the amount of demand that we've seen over the last quarter or so. San Francisco is the same. But again, we are not stepping back and basically putting any kind of a label on suburban versus urban, it's way too soon to tell. We have good diversification across all of our markets, I guess, whether they're in suburban or urban markets. And we will continue to track and see the lingering impact from the pandemic. And again, just the shift in overall patterns about where people choose to live, it's way too soon to tell. One thing that has been pronounced that we see from a demand standpoint in both markets is the work from home impact. We see many more of our customers coming to us, because they are not going to a traditional office they need more space at home. And by virtue of that, they're putting more stuff in our facilities. So that's been a meaningful additional demand factor that we've seen, both in urban and suburban markets. Ronald Kamdem : And then the second question was just on just the July operating trends. I don\u2019t know if you've mentioned it already. But just what occupancy is sitting at and what the change in pricing? Thank you. Tom Boyle : So I hit on that just a moment ago, but I'll get a little bit more context on operating trends in July. Move-in volumes were better in the month of July. Move-in volumes were down about 2%. Move-out volumes were actually down about 15%, which led to an increase in occupancy through the months. And I just highlighted July 30th, our occupancy was up around 140 basis points year-over-year. I would note that about 20 basis points of that is related to delayed auction activity. Overall, July, we saw continued improving operating trends, as Joe mentioned earlier. Joe Russell : One area I would also add on is our non same store portfolio, in particular has been quite vibrant. We have a fair amount of both new development acquisition opportunities for customers to move in. And we've seen an inordinate amount of move-in activity, which has been quite a good surprise or a good benefit based on a number of things we're seeing from a trend standpoint. So, I mentioned that we\u2019ve moved in about 400,000 customers in the last four months. If you just look at Q2 of the 300,000 or so customers that moved in, 60,000 of those move-ins came into our non same store portfolio. The non same store portfolio continues to do quite well from an occupancy growth standpoint and were up about 11%. Continue to see very good trends and tractions relative to both new builds, redevelopment, and acquisitions that we've added into the portfolio. That total pool is 13.5 million square feet and we continue to see very good performance and fill ups across all markets. Frankly, we haven't seen any of our acquisitions and developments going backwards in this environment. They have done the absolute opposite where they're filling up pretty dramatically. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Rick Skidmore of Goldman Sachs. Rick Skidmore : Joe, just to follow up on a previous question on the external growth fronts. It sounded like your focus has been more domestic versus international. Is that the right way we should be thinking about your comments on the acquisition front? Joe Russell : So Rick, we're going to continue as we always have to look in many markets, both within and outside the U.S. I wouldn't say that our focus has changed over the long-term any differently. There's no question over the last few months. We've put particular focus on everything that's going on right here in the United States. But over time, we will continue to assess and look at opportunities beyond the United States. Rick Skidmore : And then one bigger picture question, Joe. In the past, you've talked about supply growth and supply growth fading in 2020. Can you just talk about what you're seeing from a supply growth standpoint as the pandemic slowed developments or financing for new projects? And are you starting to see that manifest itself in your markets? Thank you. Joe Russell : There is still healthy amount of supply that continues to be delivered into 2020. Last quarter, we talked about the likelihood that it would be anywhere say 15% to 20% or so less than what was predicted, which would point to plus or minus at $5 billion or so level of deliveries in 2020. We think that's probably closer to $4 billion or less. There doesn't appear to be any slowdown this year anyway relative to those deliveries taking place. Although, some of them are taking longer. No surprise, many cities have slowed down their own approval processes, whether through inspections. Again, final occupancy permits, et cetera. So, we still think that there's a healthy amount of supply. It kind of goes into level of supply you saw in the 2017 or so era. Now looking out to '21 and beyond, I would expect, based again, on what I mentioned earlier. There will likely be more constraints around funding that many of these developers look for relative to construction loans. And again, the investment hurdles that either they and/or their partners are going to require to move forward on any particular acquisition, or any particular development, excuse me. So we're likely to see, again, another leg down. I don't know how hard and dramatic that might be. But it would be a welcome relief, particularly in the markets that we've been pointing to over the last couple of years that have been bit heavy with new supply. So, too soon to tell yet the lingering impact into '21 and beyond, but we're likely to see again another leg down. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Mike Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Mike Mueller : Just wondering, how are the year-over-year move in rate comps in July versus 2Q is down 14%? Tom Boyle : So move-in rate change in the month of July was down a little over 4%, move-in volumes down about 2%, move-in rate down about 4%. Mike Mueller : And I\u2019m curious the expansion of the third party management business. How's that trended over the past four months or so with the pandemic? Joe Russell : The number of properties we added to the platform in the quarter was nine. We have 106 properties now. The continues to grow. It's still dominated by properties that are going through various phases of construction. Although, we are also seeing stabilized and/or lease-up assets coming into the portfolio and the platform as well. So, not unlike what we saw in the acquisition arena to some degree, it would kick out a little quieter for a month or two on the early part of the pandemic. But as things have settled down, we're seeing good activity. And we continue to bring new properties into the platform, whether they're new and we're actually opening them. We opened again several in the quarter and we're bringing more into the portfolio as we\u2019re going through different phases of completion and development. The backlog is healthy and we're continuing to add to it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I don't know if you can answer this, or maybe talk a little bit about the differences. But you said that your occupancy was effectively only inflated, if you will, by 20 to 30 basis points from the lack of auctions. And one of your peers yesterday talked about that number being closer to 150 basis points to maybe 200 basis points. And I'm just really trying to figure out, is there differences, or what the differences are that would cause such a large delta? And then, is there anything around maybe the unemployment insurance payments that came into folks over the last four months, providing them with more income that might have helped on the collection front and therefore, your fees are down as you talked about and that helps kind of keep the delinquencies and the auction process down. But just seem to be a very wide difference between you and your peer. Tom Boyle : I think we've spoken about this. I'll reiterate some of the comments. I obviously can't speak to what others are seeing in the industry. But I'll comment on what we're seeing, which we did see better collection trends and that's driving lower fees. It's also, as we move back to conducting auctions, that's reduced the amount of backlog. So, combination of conducting lean sales, as well as better collections leading to 20 basis points of aged delinquency. I would highlight that we obviously worked with customers throughout the second quarter on different ways. As I highlighted, about 7% of our customers requested some form of relief in the second quarter, and we're very receptive to those sorts of requests as we helped customers that were having a tough time. But those really started to moderate as we move through the quarter. And as Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases of the second quarter, we started to see better trends there. I think your comment around government support is a good one. And I do think that be it unemployment benefits or $1,200 checks. There's no question that across the country folks got some support through the second quarter, which likely helped collections in our business and in many businesses. And I don't think we're alone to highlight the collections. We're good through the second quarter. I think if you were to listen to banks or to credit card companies, they would likely say something similar. So I think that there is some support there. And ultimately, we'll see what the trajectory is of that support going forward, and that could certainly have an impact on our collection trends and others in the industry as well. But we generally covered most of the different components of it. Maybe one more stat as we just disclosed stats around, on this particular topic. I highlighted that customers are paying us earlier and that's resulted in, if you just look at the snapshot at June 30, our our rent receivable from customers who are less than 60 days is down about 35%. So, customers are paying for their storage space and finding good value in it. And we're working with them and obviously working with those that have been impacted by the pandemic to make sure that they receive the appropriate accommodation as well. Steve Sakwa : And then maybe a twist on Mike Mueller's question. I think he asked about the kind of the move-in rate, you said it was down 4%. But if you look at the July move-in rate against the July move-out rate, which I know you provide those quarterly in the 10-Qs. Do you have an idea, or do you know what that spread was in July? Tom Boyle : I don't have that number right in front of me. I could tell you that the move out rate was down 6% year-over-year and the move-in rate was down 4%. So good trends as it relates to year-over-year comps. I don't, at my fingertips, have rate per square foot but we can follow up with that if that's important to you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Just as we look at your two newly developed properties that you opened in the quarter with the backdrop that you're looking, potentially it\u2019s slowing trends for the second half of the year. Can you just kind of compare your forecasted lease up period to a stabilized occupancy, maybe your current expectations to how they were compared to originally underwritten? Joe Russell : Well, Todd, I would just back up and give you maybe a little bit perspective on how we traditionally look at lease up periods to begin with, which frankly is, at the end of the day, no different now than it might've been pre pandemic. It's typical for a property to take three or four years to go through, not only occupancy, lease up at level of stability and stabilization that you're going to see from the maturing of the customer base, et cetera. So if anything, as I've mentioned, we've actually been seeing an accelerated lease up in properties that we put into development, redevelopment or even acquisition. And again, just because again we're even seeing that acceleration right now, we're not stepping back and retooling or resetting expectations. We'll have to see over time how this demand continues to trend. But it begins with the same premise, which is takes up to that three to four years typically for a property to get to that level of stabilization. We're going to look at that time period typically to decide whether or not to put the property in the same store and again, look at the stability that it typically plays out across different markets, et cetera. So no real change yet in the way that we're modeling and looking at the timeframe for stabilization. Operator : Our next question comes from the top Todd Thomas of Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Joe, maybe Tom, you've talked now about improving trends throughout the second quarter and into July a couple of times, including the improvements in move in rates down just 4% year over year in July. I understand that the in place contract rents are lower at 3.1% at quarter end versus the down 2% for the second quarter on average. So the financial impact will continue to get worse in the second half. But how much of a lag would you expect there to be before the in place contractual rents on a year over year basis begin to stabilize and maybe begin to improve if trends in general remain consistent? Joe Russell : Sure, that's a good question. Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball in terms of exactly how the environment is going to play out from here. We're absolutely in an uncertain environment and one that none of us have lived through in the past to be able to understand what the healthcare impact, what the government policy impact will be and where we go from here is hard to predict, is no question starting the quarter with contract rents down 3.1%, is a much worse place than where we started the second quarter from a year-over-year standpoint. The benefits we have going into the third and fourth quarter are that right now, we are sending existing tenant rate increases but we're also being mindful of what the local jurisdictions regulations are around that and also the impact to our customer base in what is a tough healthcare environment. And so, I think it's hard to project going forward right now magnitude of those increases is lower year-over-year. So, that's not going to be a meaningful contributor to the upside of rental rate growth. And move in and move out trends, we're seeing good demand trends now and lower move outs. We've highlighted in the past that in the last downturn, we did see elevated move outs. We've seen the exact opposite this time to date. But we're also mindful that the healthcare situation could be having a significant impact on those trends. And as we move through this year and into next year, the developments on those fronts, I think will likely impact our move in and move out trends as well. So, I know that's a long winded way of saying. I don't really know when things would change materially. But I gave you a sense of what some of the drivers would be that would move in place rents. Todd Thomas : As we move further throughout the year here into the back half of the year, and we're looking at, I guess, potentially a more elongated leasing season. Do you expect to have a little bit more seasonal pricing power in August, September, maybe October, on a year-over-year basis than you would ordinarily in prior years? Joe Russell : I think the one thing I'd remind you there is that we're still facing an environment that we were in the first quarter of significant new supply being delivered into many of our markets in addition to navigating through this unique pandemic environment. I think Joe highlighted the improving operating trends. If you looked at it on a market-by-market basis, I would say the healthcare environment and situation was the biggest driver of market variance of operating trends in April. But as we move through the quarter into June and July, the biggest differentials from a market standpoint on operating trends, like move in to move out has been more the typical things that we would have been talking about, the impact of new supply in many of our sub markets. And I think that's likely to persist here, as Joe mentioned, future deliveries. So, I don't think the operating environment is such that while we've seen improving trends that it's going to get materially better in any sort of base case. But ultimately, we'll see where we go. We're still dealing with a lot of the headwinds that we spoke about earlier in the year. Todd Thomas : And just a follow up on a prior question, just regarding population trends and work from home trends. I know Public's footprints, national and scope and you're diversified, but you do have larger concentrations in some markets like LA and San Fran, New York. Are you having any discussions, or strategic discussions around sort of reallocating capital or thinking about investing differently in sort of a post-pandemic environment, or is it too soon to think about those strategies? Joe Russell : It's still too soon, Todd. We will obviously continue to assess the variety of different impacts this kind of environment puts into different markets and sub markets. The business is still very dominated by that very small trade area that three to five miles zone and in an urban environment even much smaller. So again, the portfolio is highly diversified. We enjoy the benefits of the diversification and we'll continue to assess that on an ongoing basis, just like we always have. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ryan Burke for any additional closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Maria, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Take care. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Christy. Hello everyone.

We assume no obligation to update or revise any of the statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our earnings release, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid quarter and now we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Alua Askarbek of Bank of America. Alua Askarbek : Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So just looking at the transactions market, it seems like there was a good amount of activity in 3Q and you guys alluded that to -- alluded to that during your 2Q call. But there was also a surprising amount of portfolio deals. Can you give us some color about what you're seeing in the market currently and any of the opportunities going forward? And then also any color on cap rates and the recent 30 portfolio -- property portfolio deal under contract right now? Joe Russell : Okay. Sure Alua. The acquisition market clearly has opened up. We've been tracking it through the pandemic and spoke about the early months where a number of sellers paused and were reticent to bring properties into the market. But we've clearly seen many more do the reverse where they've looked at this environment as an opportune time to bring assets into the acquisition arena. The thing -- a number of things are continuing to fuel that. One is it's still a very good time to do a trade. There's very low interest rates availability of capital, there's a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that's been anxious to get into the storage sector. And frankly, the storage sector continues to perform well. So there's been a window of opportunity that we've seen increase over the last month particularly in the quarter that set us up well to have a very active 2020. The things that we continue to do are look for assets that are particularly well positioned from a location and quality standpoint that meet our requirements relative to location and opportunity to round out presence whether they're in our prime core markets or other markets that we want to add additional product to. The thing that was unusual and we're encouraged by as we also as you asked have a sizable single portfolio under contract that we think is a great set of assets that will be very good for us to bring into the portfolio. In total, it's 36 properties across 15 markets, 13 different states. 24 of the assets are open and operating, but they're relatively new. Average age is two to three years, I would call them Class A properties in very good locations, and we're very excited to bring them into the portfolio knowing that we're looking for opportunities to lease-up properties because we have very good customer demand. So they'll be easily integrated and we anticipate closing the first 24 of those assets by the end of the year. With that portfolio which we're also well poised to capture and look for some I think interesting growth and performance opportunities as there's 12 additional properties in various phases of development that will be completed through 2021. Again Class A well-located assets and we're really pleased by the ability to capture that total portfolio. Another interesting part of the portfolio, it was -- it is an off-market deal. So it speaks to the level of relationships that we continue to build across the storage sector. This relationship has evolved over a longer period of time and we continue to look for those opportunities where they may play through. Beyond the large portfolio that I just talked about, we're also seeing a number of smaller opportunities, which we've been seeing through 2020 and frankly what we saw even in 2019. And so with that we're poised to have a very strong acquisition year, this year. I would tell you from a cap rate standpoint with the amount of capital and the cost of that capital. We're really not seeing any easing of cap rates and we'll have to continue to monitor that. We clearly have good access to capital. Ourselves our own cost of capital continues to be very attractive. Tom can give you a little color later in the call about what we see relative to funding through either the preferred market or the debt markets. But we're clearly seeing some good opportunities to put that capital to work and we are continuing to look and hunt for additional acquisitions going forward. Alua Askarbek : Great. Thank you. And then just a little bit on rent increases to existing customers, I know in the beginning you guys noted that you're not going to be increasing rents as much as you did in prior years. But with -- I guess now cases are going up, but is there -- do you have an expectation when you're going to be able to get back to your historical bonds? Tom Boyle : Yeah. Well, let me give you a little bit of context, this is Tom, around what we've been doing through the quarter on existing tenants and then what we think the outlook is. As we noted in the 10-Q we did resume and we discussed on the last call, we resumed existing tenant rate increases in the third quarter. We did so initially on a test basis and have since increased the volumes of those rental rate increases that we've sent out as we've grown more confident in the performance of our existing tenants. Since we didn't send any increases in the second quarter, we did have a clinical backlog of potential tenants to increase rent on in the third quarter, and we did send those catch up rental rate increases. As you noted those increases went out with a lower magnitude out of increase given overall mindfulness of our customer base in this crisis environment and as you highlighted still very dynamic, as well as state and local price regulations in many of our markets. We expect some of that to continue as we move through future quarters, certainly navigating this dynamic health care environment is unpredictable. We would expect that the existing tenant rate increases will continue to be a modest drag on in-place rent growth as we move forward. Stepping back, customer activity has been solid. And I just highlighted the existing tenant performance has been good. That's across the board. So that collections are better, payment patterns have accelerated, move-outs are down, length of stays are extending and new customer demand is solid. So we're seeing good trends there. And overall move-in activity has been good. But existing tenants will continue to be a modest drag going forward. Alua Askarbek : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. My question is really just about move out activity. Your portfolio is always kind of generally had an upward bias in occupancies, but you did note that move-outs have slowed. And I'm just wondering as things normalize, I mean, do you have a sense of how much occupancy might be higher based on the slowdown in move-out activity? I'm just trying to think about how your occupancy may change over the next few quarters if things maybe get back to normal? And what might you do to encourage some of those customers to stay I guess? Joe Russell : Sure. So I'll provide a little context around the move-out activity, because it has been one of the surprises as we move through this pandemic period. As we rewind to April and early May, we had move-in volumes and move-out volumes that were lower. But as we moved into May and June and then, into the third quarter move-in activity has increased, but move-out activity has remained muted. And dissecting the geographies, the customer tenures, the customer segments with which move-outs are lower, it is really across the board and clearly being driven by the current health care environment. And you highlighted and we discussed in the 10-Q and the MD&A, the likelihood at point that rate of deceleration will moderate and we talked about in previous calls the fact that in other recessionary environments, we've actually seen the opposite play through, with higher move-outs given consumer stress. We've not experienced at this time. And in fact it was pretty consistent, through the third quarter, to give you a sense each of the months in the third quarter, saw 12% to 15% decline, in move-out volumes. And as I mentioned, it's across geographies, across customers tenure bans and customer segments. So really broad-based decline in move-outs, paired with good collection activity and accepting the rental rate increases that we've sent to-date. So we've encouraged by the existing tenants. We do have our eyes on, what could playout, as we move in this dynamic environment. And we do watching that very closely. But through October, move-outs continue to be lower. Tom Boyle : And yeah Smedes, so what's playing through right now that again, month-by-month we're seeing more sustained and consistent consumer behavior. Work from home is additive, meeting is another factor that we're seeing from a survey standpoint, relative to the customers coming to the portfolio. And what's driving that decision. You've got a number of markets, whether you label them as, urban or high-density and/or related to even concentration of tax that use the Bay Area for instance, where we see system-wide our highest level of occupancies. Thousands of employees, have been given allow to move, out of that market, either temporarily or potentially permanently. And are shifting and amplifying the need for self-storage, as either they're dealing with the health crisis and the flexibility that they've got to work at either at home or completely different localization, seeing similar impacts right, again in the heart of New York, set of assets. So that's additive. The housing market is very strong right now. That's always a traditional and very good driver for our business. But housing sales were up over 20%, as we speak, on a year-over-year basis. And it's a driver. So you've got layers of different consumer patterns that are playing through, that are pointing to more sustained and prolonged need for storage space. So we don't know when and to what degree, it will shift back to a \"normal environment\", but the amount of sustained activity that we're seeing now into the eight month of this health crisis continues to be quite good. Smedes Rose : Okay. That's great color. And then, I'm just wondering, maybe broadly, you've talked before just kind of what you're seeing on the supply outlook overall? Or if you're seeing any kind of, changes on the increment versus your last update on, just overall nationwide supply dollars in development, that you typically talked about? Joe Russell : Yeah, not -- I wouldn't say, anything to point to that is materially different. We do think that 2020 will plus or minus calc out to be about a $4-or-so billion set of deliveries across all of our markets here in the United States. The anticipated shift down into deliveries in 2021 was something in the range of 15-or-so percent. So we could still see that, degradation and deliveries. But frankly it's still high. And with the continued interest from an investor base, to get into the self-storage sector and performance that the product type itself continues to have even in this challenging environment. As mentioned earlier, there is still a fair amount of capital that wants to get into the space, whether it's through acquisitions or even development. So, it's to something that we're keeping a close eye on but it really hasn't changed that much from our prior outlook. Smedes Rose : Great. Okay. Thank you guys. Joe Russell : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Spenser Allaway of Green Street. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Can you guys provide a bit more color on what drove the material deceleration of marketing spend in the quarter? And where you see this trending for the balance of the year? Joe Russell : Sure. So, stepping back on marketing spend that's been a tool that we've utilized along with promotional discounts and move-in rates over the past several years and what was a tough customer acquisition environment. Given the impact of new supply in many of our markets. And so we did increase our spend over the last several years and have liked the returns that we've seen utilizing advertising spend and that really is across paid surge it social media we use television in the second quarter kind of a broad-based advertising approach to attract new customers. We do have real advantages in using advertising as a tool given our brand name and presence online. And so we like that too and we will continue to use it as we navigate this dynamic environment. In the second quarter, given lower top of funnel demand we were more aggressive on marketing spend. And as top of funnel demand improved as we moved into the third quarter we removed some of that advertising support. But as you note our advertising spend was up about 8% or 9% in the quarter and we will continue to use that tool as we play through what's a dynamic environment but we did not need the level of support we saw in the second quarter given improved top of funnel trends. Spenser Allaway : Okay. And then maybe just lastly, we recently saw a large storage transaction with Blackstone acquiring the simply portfolio. Was this a deal you guys looked at? And can you comment on whether the portfolio would have been of interest to you? Joe Russell : So, we're active in all markets and have the opportunity to look at most deals. So I'll comment on is we're highly entrenched in most if not all the deals that are happening in any variety of different types of transactions large and small. And we are continuing to track and see the level of activity. I'm not really going to comment on our view and perception of that particular portfolio but we're highly entrenched and our acquisition team continues to be incredibly engaged whether they're marketed deals as that particular one was or deals that are not marketed which points to the portfolio I talked about earlier. Tom Boyle : Yes. Maybe I like that transaction is emblematic of what Joe highlighted earlier around institutional capital looking to invest in self-stored because of its performance through cycles. And so it's interesting to see another institutional player put a significant amount of capital into the sector. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi thanks. Tom helpful color on some of the move-out trends. Can you comment on move-in trends throughout the quarter and through October what the cadence was like? And then the strength in move-in rates was rather significant. They were rates were higher in the quarter than they've been in several years. Did you push move-in rates above market during the quarter just given where your occupancy is? Or was that increase sort of more commensurate with the market rent growth in your view? Tom Boyle : Sure Todd. So, kind of stepping back on the move-in trends like I did with move-out trends. We did see move in activity kind of surge in March we saw it really slow down in April. We moved into a third phase that we call internally kind of recovery in May and June. And then really since July first seen an improvement in top of funnel demand pair that with reduced move-out activity as I just highlighted means that occupancy has moved higher in really all of our markets across the country. And that improved occupancy certainly reduced the inventory levels that we had. And that really persisted through the quarter. We finished the second quarter up about 50 basis points in occupancy. We finished the third quarter up 200 basis points proceeding here. We finished October up 230 basis points in occupancy and so customer trends being move-in and move-out have been good and with lower inventory, that's allowed us to achieve higher move-in rates. Our move-in rates were up 8.2% in the quarter, in October, to give you a sense, the strength of top of funnel and the move-out trends have continued, which has led move-in volumes to be up about 1% in October and move-in rates, up about 10%. So, the trends have continued and obviously seeing the benefit of demand for storage, both from our existing tenants who want to continue to use storage in this environment as Joe mentioned for many reasons, as well as new customers seeking new space. Todd Thomas : Okay. And obviously, there's just a lot of I guess sort of ins and outs, when you think about demand. But Joe, I'm curious in a market like New York, you mentioned San Francisco, where a lot of workers have flexibility to work from home and move out of some of these high-cost markets, which the data and headlines suggest is happening. Why is that out migration activity translating into strong demand in those markets? And do you expect that to moderate or maybe unwind, I guess to some extent over time? Is that a risk in your view? Joe Russell : Well, it's a spectrum of different drivers, Todd. So, part of the flexibility for instance if you look at the Bay Area that many tech workers have been given is, when a big employer many of whom you -- anyone of us can point to gives signals and/or time frames where they may not be pulling their employees back, not for one or two months, for six months to a year, coupled with giving them full flexibility to be somewhere else. That could vary. So, some employees will still come back. There's no question about that, but it may be for several months or several quarters depending again on the unknown timing of the pandemic itself. And then to what degree these become permanent relocations and then some commensurate impact on the need to keep goods or whatever they're keeping it in one of our units in that particular market will be a question and can predict it, don't know. Fortunately, again, if you look at the Bay Area for instance, we have an opportunity to stand out there because we've got a very well-placed portfolio. It's very difficult to add new supply there. So, the different need for that space in that market long term is quite high. There's no question about it. And it's difficult to build there. So, it's not a market by any means that we\u2019re concerned about from an oversupply standpoint et cetera. This has just been a very unusual environment where this demand has been so elevated where I mentioned we've got system high occupancies of 97%, 98% this time a year. I mean, we have never seen that before. So, it's to be determined. It's hard to predict. And the flexibility and the way in which employees, whether they're tech-oriented or other traditional office users change over time is to be determined. But as Tom mentioned, we're seeing -- it's just in these urban or more dense markets we're seeing healthy demand across the entire system. We frankly don't have a market that's down in occupancy. It continues to percolate our lease-up of our newly built and required assets is very strong. And consumer demand continues to be very, very active, particularly for this time a year. Tom Boyle : Yes. And Todd, maybe just to provide a couple of other market anecdotes for you. Markets like Charlotte for instance, we've seen very good incoming demand in a market that had been suffering from new supply over the last several years. We've seen good new customer demand, improving occupancies, improving rates. Even within the San Francisco Bay Area, while you can clearly make a case for a very urban peninsula and the city of San Francisco, we've seen strength in our lease-ups in San Jose for instance and a strong housing market there. So, there's -- we have a well placed portfolio around the country and we're seeing good demand in both markets that may see outflow as well as those that are seeing inflow. Todd Thomas : Right. That's interesting. Is the demand for larger units -- are you seeing that as individuals are maybe looking to rent larger spaces for their apartments or homes for a sort of period of time. Tom Boyle : Actually it is opposite which is strength year-over-year has actually been in smaller spaces versus larger spaces believe it or not. Joe Russell : Yes. So theoretically you could argue that again if you just think of the demand that's tied to work from home it's just not somebody holistically leaving an entire house or an apartment, it may also be a very healthy level of demand tied to just needing that extra closet or that extra bedroom or that area is not only because it's a work from home maybe family members come back or whatever. And there are layers and layers of demand factors that we're tracking. But as we've said, it's solid demand. Todd Thomas : Okay. All right. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist Ki Bin Kim : Good morning out there. Just going back to some of the acquisitions you made in the quarter and fourth quarter, can you just provide some more color or parameters around yields, at least for your stabilized portion? Joe Russell : Ki Bin, I'm not going to give you specifics about the actual yield. I would tell you it's similar to ranges that we've looked for over time which on a stabilized basis would be 5% to 6% plus on a cash-on-cash yield or north of that. The thing that I didn\u2019t mentioned about the portfolio that we'll be closing this quarter is the occupancies about 35%. We look at that as a very good thing relative to again the opportunity to lease-up space based on the demand factors that we're seeing, the great locations that these assets are tied to and the quality of the assets. So it's a very good opportunity for us to stabilize those assets to put our own marketing and operational tactics and strategies into them. And we feel like we'll have very good returns once we get the assets stabilized. As you well know that can take anywhere from three to four years on a normalized basis, not only once you get to stabilized occupants at more stabilized revenue and pricing metrics. So we'll continue to look for again the stabilization of those assets. But as I mentioned, very high quality, good solid assets and adds in many ways you could consider it almost like a near-term or more recently delivered developments on our part. So again very good opportunity to drive good value from them. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thanks. And when I look at your same-store revenue, it improved slightly to negative 2.7% from minus 3% last quarter. Obviously, the underlying drivers are pointing towards a much better place, right where fee-based rates are up 8%, better occupancy and things like that. So I was wondering if you could just provide some more details behind the transitory nature of the underlying drivers and how that might benefit same-store revenue going forward, in particular things like existing customer rate increases. I'm not sure how much normally it contributes whereas in 3Q it didn't? And going forward how do we expect that to normalize? Just to understand that magnitude a little better? Tom Boyle : Sure. Ki Bin, it's Tom. I think we spent some time talking last quarter around the cumulative impact of the pandemic, which was likely to continue to impact revenue growth trends as we move forward and we did see that into the third quarter. Operating metrics have removed more quickly than financial metrics and we \u2013 let's pick a part of the occupancy and rate equation. I commented earlier around how occupancy trends have improved with a combination of better top of funnel activity as well as lower move-out volumes. And so that's improved occupancy trends. In many of our markets we have reached occupancies that are frictional, meaning we are at 97%, 98% occupancy in the middle of the month, which is friction in our industry. So it's a matter of what play through with rates in some of those markets as we move forward. As you just highlighted and we spoke about earlier, existing tenant rate increases are not going to be a contributing factor to improving rent trends given the magnitude of the increases are likely to be lower as we move forward through the fourth quarter. That said, just looking at in-place rents from June 30 \u2013 at June 30 in-place rents were down 3.1% and we finished the quarter September 30, down 1.8%. And with existing tenants not contributing to that improvement that negative impact was more than offset by improved customer activity and the reduction of rent roll down. If you look at the third quarter of 2019, rent roll down was about 15%, and as we moved into the third quarter of 2020 that narrowed down to about 4%. So improved rent roll down more than offsetting the degradation from existing tenant rate increase drag in the quarter. Looking forward, aggregate contract rents recovered. So occupancy and rent combined to positive 20 basis points at September 30 and we've continued to see good customer trends through October so better rental income trends. Fees which have been a negative contributor to revenue growth in both the second and third quarters, we anticipate to continue to do so as we move forward and that's really driven by customers paying their rent, which is a great thing, but is a degradation in revenue and the growth. So I think, we spoke a little bit about that on the last call Ki Bin, but we continue to see that and we'd anticipate that through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Next? Operator : Your next question is Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on the balance sheet, Tom. You've got like $1.2 billion preferred that, I guess, are callable throughout 2021. I'm just sort of, curious on your thoughts about replacing them with new preferred. I think your last deal was sub 4%. And how do you, sort of, weigh that maybe against kind of putting some more debt on the balance sheet just given how lowly leveraged you are? And where do you think the comparable say 30-year kind of debt issuance would be for you today versus a preferred offering? Tom Boyle : So, sure. So Steve, you highlighted what is a good opportunity in 2021, which is another year of potential preferred refinancing activity be it with debt or preferred. Looking at our preferred balance, we like having around a $4 billion preferred balance in the capital stack. We think it's good for the business through cycles. And the optionality both to have perpetual capital in the capital stack, but at the same time if interest rates decrease over time the ability to call them like we did this year, and you're highlighting the opportunity for next year. So throughout this year, we've redeemed about $1.2 billion of preferred. We haven't issued quite that much yet and we were active in the bond market in Europe in January. Financing markets, as Joe highlighted earlier are as attractive as they have ever been. Preferreds are sub-4% for us today, which is a record low, which presents that opportunity and we have great access to debt capital too. As we said in previous settings we'll look to utilize both preferreds and debt for incremental financing activity as we move through 2021 for both preferred refinancing as well as for potential acquisition opportunities and development which clearly, as Joe highlighted earlier is accelerating as we move through the fourth quarter. So good access to capital and we'll utilize both and we hope that we have the opportunity to refinance in 2021 like we did in 2020 and 2019. Steve Sakwa : So just do you have a sense for where like a 30-year bond offering, if you wanted to go longer out on the, sort of, curve how that would compare to a pref offering? Tom Boyle : A 30-year bond is going to be cheaper. A 10-year bond is going to be even cheaper than that 5-year bond even cheaper than that. So we've got lots of tools in the toolkit. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then just on the acquisition front you guys from time to time have obviously, looked outside the U.S. and spent some time in Australia. Joe, I'm just curious, sort of, where your head is today about looking for international opportunities outside of the domestic opportunities. Joe Russell : Yes, Steve we're going to continue to look both domestic and internationally. So we have clearly, the opportunity from a knowledge base. We've learned a lot through our involvement and success through the Shurgard investment. And we feel over time that we can continue to grow both here domestically and internationally. It's always going to be subject to different types of opportunities and the particular market that may be for whatever set of reasons well-timed from an attractive point to either enter or find appropriate opportunities. So we're going to continue to assess opportunities both here domestically and internationally. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Thanks for the time. The first one is, just circling back on the demand question. Just trying to understand obviously looking at the analysis, just looking for sort of more thematic in terms of -- is there anything that stands out in terms of the demand driver in this period, whether it be college students, small businesses, work from home, or just people leaving the city. And the reason I ask that is, one of the questions we get a lot is, presumably, once the vaccine is here and it normalizes, really trying to get at which drivers are going to stay and pick around and which drivers were really just sort of a one timer? And maybe what new demand drivers we may not be thinking about again once we normalize? Thanks. Joe Russell : Yes. Ron, that's certainly something that we're going to continue to track, as these different demand factors play through. It's hard to predict the sustainability or the likelihood that some of them are here permanently or they\u2019re going to shift up and down. I already talked a little bit about the work-from-home demand factor. That's clearly new at this level of magnitude. And whether or not that sustains from a demand stat standpoint after the pandemic settles down or not, is to be determined. Many companies are looking at work-from-home platforms as different and new way of enhancing productivity and employee satisfaction. But the theoretical argument against that is there may be the opposite going through too. So it's a little bit hard to predict. And at the moment we're just going to continue to survey and understand and see these drivers. The interesting thing is they're all additive and they're continuing to drive as we've talked about, very optimized performance. We'll continue to learn from this and it's brought frankly a healthy and new set of customers into the storage sector, never used the product before. So I think, long term, that's a good thing. The adoption of the product continues to grow statistically. And it once again is proving that the product is highly resilient, it's highly adaptable and consumers like it. The things that we continue to do also are, find ways of making the customer interaction that much more effective, making it a much more easy decision and transaction. So many of the tools that we've been putting into our technological channels and options for customers are serving us well, about 40-plus percent of our move-in volume in the third quarter came from our e-rental platform that frankly was in test mode before the pandemic came about, but statistically we moved in 115,000 customers directly through that a channel and that transaction takes about five minutes and consumers love it. And that's not just because of the pandemic. It's just a great and easy way to capture a storage unit. So we've got different things that we're also able to test in a very challenging environment like this, that are frankly giving us even new and different tools that could lead to different levels of dealing with customers in a very different way than we were doing before that again are very aligned with their ability to think even more positively about needing a storage facility, because it's that much used or easier to capture and is that much more cost effective. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second question was, just digging in deeper a little bit into acquisition. Just trying to get sort of harder numbers and quantifying it. Clearly, at the cost of capital you talked about sort of the pipeline deals that have identified of at least $700 million. The question is, is there -- just for PSA, when you sort of take a step back and look at your team. Is there $500 million $1 billion maybe even more of acquisition opportunities that are for the company a year? Or just trying to understand what's the mitigating factor? Is there not enough sellers? Is it too competitive, but the company decided tomorrow to take acquisitions up, what would be the mitigating factor to getting to a number like that? Joe Russell : Well, I wouldn't say as simple as just saying we turned on and switch and said, let's just go buy whatever we can get our hands on. We have very disciplined analytics that we use that give us the right guidepost to say these are the relative. And I would say better timed opportunities to deploy capital. This is, at the moment, a good window to do that. Our cost of capital, as Tom reiterated, is very, very good. Our access to capital is very good. We know most of the markets that we operate in much better than others do. So we have different ways for us to step back and understand the relative ultimate capital allocation, performance and ability to drive value through not only our acquisition environment but our development and redevelopment activities. So, we have all those tools. We continue to analyze them. And we've got a balance sheet that can clearly accommodate multiple factors of the volume that we were even talking about this quarter. So, I don't see that as anyway a limiter, and we're going to continue to evaluate the timing and the quality and the fit of any particular acquisition, whether it's one-off, whether it's a medium-sized portfolio or a sizable one. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey. Good morning. This is an extension of Steve's earlier question. But what are you and the Board believe is the appropriate amount of leverage? All four legacy self-storage REIT share prices are up low-double-digits year-to-date on a total return basis. Yet balance sheets range from three turns of leverage for PSA including preferreds to more than six turns at peers. So during 100-year pandemic and recession when balance sheets should have mattered most -- it hasn't really benefited PSA. I'm just curious if views towards leverage have changed at all over the past eight months? Joe Russell : Yeah. What I would say is that our perspective around leverage is long-term held belief that we should have a conservative balance sheet that allows us to invest through cycles. That allowed us access to capital throughout this year as you highlighted. And I think this year has been somewhat unique. And in fact that we're in a deep recession and financing markets have been attractive throughout. I think we've also highlighted that we have capacity to utilize that balance sheet in times like this to fund acquisitions, and we're doing that in the second half of this year. So we definitely have some capacity from here to add incremental leverage. And we're doing that as we move forward. In terms of the appropriate amount of leverage, we think a conservative long-term view, and a single A rating is an appropriate place for a REIT of our size scale and capability. Jonathan Hughes : So earlier you said you like having $4 billion of preferreds in the cap stack. I mean how do you over the exact number, why not more? I guess you said, you alluded to you can use more preferreds to go consolidate share, but are you talking upwards of another turn? I think leverage was $4 billion turns back in 2007, so do you have any range we could use. Joe Russell : So yes, Jon, the range is highlighted $4 billion. I didn't mean that that would be the maximum. I meant it more that I liked having $4 billion. So I would consider that. And why did I say $4 billion? It's because about the amount we have currently outstanding. Meaning I like the amount we have outstanding and over time would anticipate that to grow, and would anticipate our debt balance to grow as the company continues to grow and our EBITDA grows and the business grows. Jonathan Hughes : Okay. I just want to make sure it wasn't like arbitrary. You like the number four or something like that. And then one more -- I figure it as much. I just -- the four stuck up to me. What about funding acquisitions, on a leverage-neutral basis by raising common equity. I realize that hasn't been done in, I think decade. But plenty of other large REITs still raise common equity to grow on a leverage-neutral basis, and given your trading to low four implied cap and above NAV, that would actually be accretive to NAV. Is that a possibility? Tom Boyle : Sure. Common equity is in the toolkit and it's something that we could utilize as you highlight. At the same time we do have capability to finance with the debt in preferred markets and debt and preferred is cheaper than common equity. So we have the ability to do that over time. But it's certainly in the toolkit. The company over time has used it more for strategic opportunities. But as the company grows, it's certainly an option to finance, as well as debt and preferred NAV so it's in the toolkit. But certainly recently, we've been utilizing debt and preferred because we have capacity to do so. Jonathan Hughes : Got it. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Hi good morning. Just hoping if you could talk a little bit about move up, but from a different perspective, I believe you mentioned earlier in the call that you typically see move-out increase during a normal \"recession\". So could you give us help again, what that has been historically through your many cycles? And just to think about the downside of if some of these benefits that are maybe onetime in nature to pass at some point actually? Joe Russell : Sure. And obviously we don't know that when we may find ourselves in a position where move-outs would accelerate. We do think that the current trends are impacted by the healthcare crisis that we're navigating through. In terms of prior crisis, if you look back at the financial crisis, we saw move-outs for several quarters up in the mid-single digits. And so -- that's an example. But what we've learned certainly through this experience is that, everyone is unique. And so, our ability to point to that is, what will happen when the pandemic eases, I think is limited and we're going to be certainly watching very closely in terms of what consumer activities will be like as we move through future quarters. And I would say it's unpredictable. And it's unpredictable because of the healthcare nature of this crisis, as well as the government activities to reduce the spread of the virus. So it's unpredictable past recessions would point to something like mid-single digits increase. Will this time be like last time? We don't know. Juan Sanabria : Fair enough. And just on the length of stay that you brought up as well. Where are we at today in your portfolio? And kind of how has that trended? And at what point, if at all you cross kind of a magic number where you maybe sneaking one more rate increase, assuming kind of the median length of stay? Joe Russell : Sure. So in terms of the benefit of length of state, you highlighted it which is okay, we get to see those longer-term tenants stay with us. We don't have to replace them and we have the opportunity to increase their rent over time. And that's already been playing out as we move through 2019 and into 2020. The length of stays we\u2019re extending last year and we started to get the beneficial impact of sending more rental rate increases last year. And as we moved into the second half of this year with the decreased move-outs more customers have been eligible for rental rate increases this year. And if this continues would anticipate that in the beginning of next year as well. And that's been somewhat of an offset to the fact that as I highlighted earlier, we've been sending lower magnitude rental rate increases. But I would say that's been on the margin at this point. And if the trend continues, it will accelerate. Juan Sanabria : So what is the average or medium length of stay? Joe Russell : It's about 10 months. Juan Sanabria : Great. And just on my super quick one. Did you say that the average occupancy was 35% for the portfolio you're acquiring that\u2019s, the one that's not in development? Is that\u2026 Joe Russell : There's 24 -- yes there's 24 properties that are operating that are average two to three years at most an age. So they are in early phases of lease-up. So that portion of the 36 property portfolio is about 35% occupied. And there are 12 properties that are under construction that will be delivered in 2021 quarter-by-quarter. So the lease-up up opportunity on the existing 24 is very good. Juan Sanabria : Yes. But not necessarily yielding anything today like from an NOI perspective? Joe Russell : No. I mean, they've got to cure and stabilized levels of performance. But we're very confident as I mentioned relative to the quality of the location the Class A buildings and we're very confident across the markets that they are positioned and that we'll do quite well with them. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is Rick Skidmore of Goldman Sachs. Rick Skidmore : Good morning, Joe and Tom. Just a really quick one. Operations declined from the second to the third quarter, which is kind of atypical for the seasonal. What was happening? Is that just lower personnel cost? And then as you look forward on that line, do you expect lower move-outs to help to bring that line down over time? Or do we -- should we expect kind of the normal seasonal pattern? Joe Russell : Yeah, Rick. We're definitely looking for and seeing opportunity from an optimization standpoint to find ways of moderating the pressure tied to payroll as a whole whether it's property and/or supervisory. So you saw some of that in the quarter. We are looking for and finding ways of optimizing operations on a number of fronts. Utilities also in the quarter were down nicely. That's tied to some intentional investments that we've made from an LED standpoint. So we've now got our entire 2,600-or-so portfolio on exterior LED lights, and we transitioned maybe about a third so far the portfolio from an interior standpoint to LED. So we're seeing nice savings relative to the utility cost. Again, utilities were down a little over 9% in the quarter. Repairs and maintenance were down. That can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on some of the repairs necessary across the portfolio, but we saw a good metric there. And overall, we continue to look for ways of optimizing costs. Tom's have been focused on looking at new and different ways of optimizing our marketing spend too. So, although, it was up -- it wasn't up as much as it's been in the last few quarters. So, again, we're looking for different ways of optimizing that spend too. Rick Skidmore : Thanks, Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Most questions have been answered, but can you just give us a quick update on third-party management and kind of how that's been trending? Joe Russell : Sure, Mike. So the program as a whole we've got 113 properties in the program we added seven in the quarter. The activity from a backlog standpoint and delivery standpoint is in some ways matching the kind of activity we're seeing on our own direct acquisition front. So we're seeing good percolation of owners that are interested in coming into the system. And we are finding high-quality assets and the program continues to build. The dominant factor as it has been since we came into the business is tied to new deliveries. So we've got a healthy growing pipeline of new assets that will also be coming into the portfolio over the next few quarters. Mike Mueller : Okay. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Peterson of Jefferies. Jon Petersen : Thanks. Sorry for if you had said this first. The portfolio you guys are buying is that from your third-party management business? And how are they currently branded? Joe Russell : Okay. They have their own. Jon Petersen : Okay. And then I guess how should we think about the third-party management business in terms of an acquisition takeout kind of pipeline for you guys going forward? Joe Russell : I think it's a natural add junk to that business and we've had a handful of situations that have percolated on that front. We'll see how it plays over time. But it's overall a great opportunity to build relationships with owners whether they're one-off owners, they only own one or two assets or other owners that have multiple assets in multiple markets. So it's been and will continue to be a healthy way of broadening our tie to a different owner pool out there. So, we'll continue to look for and develop those kinds of relationships too, as the program builds. But the portfolio, the large portfolio that we're closing on this quarter is not in our platform. Jon Petersen : Okay. Got it. All right. That's it. Thanks. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : You have a follow-up from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I just wanted to circle back on late fees, and just trying to understand how much of the drop was sort of an inability to charge customers in light of the pandemic? How much of it is more auto pay and less cash pay, and therefore fees are naturally down how much of it is maybe customers that were normally paying those have left the portfolio? I'm just trying to kind of understand, what's driving that. Joe Russell : Yeah, Steve. So I'll provide a little bit more color around customer collections in aggregate, because that is the primary reason why fees are down. And so, as we look at rent collections, really starting in the second quarter and persisting through the third have been very solid. And some of the things you highlighted are contributing i.e. AutoPay is at a modestly higher percentage. But even away from AutoPay tenants customer payment patterns have accelerated and we're charging less in terms of fees. And so obviously, if you don't charge it, you're not going to collect it. Our receivable to be down around 30% through the quarter and that's persisted through the delinquency period for tenants meaning that receivables down about 30%. We wrote off about 30% less rent. We have about 30% fewer auctions in the quarter. So overall, customer health and payment patterns have improved, and that has led to lower fees, primarily from late fees which are charged for customers not paying their rent within a grace period, but also contributed from longer into the delinquency period lean fees and lean sale fees, but primarily driven by the grace period ending late fee in the first month of customers delinquency. Steve Sakwa : So would you look at this as a bigger structural change? Or you look at this as just, it's kind of a point in time more cyclical? Or do you expect us to stay down more permanently? Joe Russell : I think early on in the pandemic, we thought that it may have been more transitory and there was customer being supported by government stimulus certainly that was the case through April and unemployment benefits and the like. And some of that has been put in the rearview mirror, the trends have continued. It's something we're watching very closely month-over-month. I would tell you that, trends continued through October and payment patterns have been very good through the early part of November as well. So it feels like at least, for the foreseeable future or near to medium term, we're anticipating that will be the case, but we're watching it very closely. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Great. Thanks. Joe Russell : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. I will now hand the call back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Christy, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Erica. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that aside from those of historical fact, all statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results as described in yesterday's earnings release and our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 25, 2021. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our earnings release, SEC reports, earnings supplement and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thanks, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, and on behalf of the entire Public Storage team, I hope you and your families are well as we all navigate through this pandemic. Looking back at the full range of events in 2020, it was clearly a year of historic extremes. The year began with the predicted consequences from oversupply in several markets. In Q2, full focus shifted to managing a myriad of unknown issues tied to the virus. This included judging impacts on our employees, customers, operations, development approvals, acquisition volume and full company revenue with an overarching effort to maintain a safe environment and keep properties open. By Q3, we saw pronounced customer activity emerge as a result of both traditional and new drivers of demand. In the fourth quarter and into this year, we have seen sustained demand that has lifted the traditional seasonal slowdown in our business, resulting in historic occupancy and move in rate growth. I commend the Public Storage team on the numerous successes we had in 2020 and their ability to be nimble and creative in an environment we have never faced before. Now I would like to highlight eight specific areas of success as I reflect on the full year and on the fourth quarter. First, the integration of technology unlocked a new contactless leasing channel, which we call e-rental, which now accounts for nearly 50% of our move-ins. Approximately 300,000 customers use this new offering in 2020. Second, move-in rates grew by 12% in Q4 compared to negative 14% in Q2. Third, we reached fourth quarter occupancy of 95.2%, a record for this time of the year. Fourth, the robust lease-up of our 32 million square foot non same-store portfolio led to 26% NOI growth for both the quarter and the year. Fifth, after two full years, our third-party management business has expanded to 120 properties with a growing backlog as we enter 2021. Sixth, our industry-leading development platform has produced a current pipeline of $560 million as we deliver generation five assets across the United States. Seventh, the acquisition team sourced nearly $800 million of assets in 2020, with over $500 million in Q4, and we are entering 2021 with an equally vibrant pipeline of $580 million. And last, our focus on the continued optimization of our balance sheet, with record low issuances of preferred equity and debt. As we begin 2021, we are well equipped and focused on driving company performance on several fronts. Our advantages include a well primed capital structure, broad and growing benefits of the digitization of our business, record occupancy and, of course, the most commanding platform and brand in the self-storage industry. The Public Storage leadership team and I look forward to sharing more of these strategies in our upcoming Investor Day on May 3. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. Financial performance improved steadily through the second half of 2020, with a return to positive same-store revenue, NOI and full company core FFO growth in the fourth quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 0.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 3.5% from the third quarter. There were two primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move in rates, as Joe highlighted, were up double digits, while move out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, which led to improving in place rents. To a lesser extent, occupancy also increased with move in volume down, move out volume down Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the fourth quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, taxes, utilities and marketing. The net result was a return to positive NOI growth of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. On the reporting front, we enhanced the presentation of same-store expenses this quarter. We broke expenses into two categories : first, direct cost of operations; and second, indirect cost of operations. This provides enhanced disclosure into property level profitability which once again demonstrates our industry-leading operating margins. We also posted our first earnings supplement on our website last night, which we hope you found helpful along with our 10-K. Next, our balance sheet. It's in great shape with two drivers of cash flow growth. First, as we have for the last five years, we have the capability to fund acquisitions and development activity with retained cash flow and unsecured debt at historically low financing costs. And second, we have the opportunity to redeem preferred stock as we move through the year. As we enter 2021, we've seen continued strength in customer demand, with occupancies up 250 basis points and in place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January. The outlook for revenue growth is good with support from demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to both move-outs as well as lingering state of emergency pricing restrictions as we move through the year. We expect continued strong expense control in 2021. We provide line-by-line commentary on our disclosure. Property tax expense growth is expected to pick up with around a 5.5% increase for the year anticipated. But away from that, better performance by utilizing technology to change operating processes, and investing in energy efficiency, we anticipate continued savings on property, payroll and utilities and a better marketing expense environment as we're operating with lower vacancies. In sum, improving revenue outlook and strong expense control as we start 2021. With that, I'll turn it back to Ryan. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Tom. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, feel free to jump back in queue for follow-up. With that, Erica, let's please open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeffrey Spector : Great, I'm here with my colleague, and yes, thank you for the supplemental. We thought it was excellent, very helpful. Also appreciate the initial comments and the '21 outlook. And we take those comments very serious. I guess, can we just expand on that a little bit more? I know we know there's still risks out there, but it seems very clear that you're optimistic on '21 and that demand should remain stable, strong. Joe Russell : Yes, Jeff, one of the things that's leading to a change in demand and consumer behavior to some degree is tied to the pandemic. We're seeing some interesting and new areas of customer behavior surfacing. You could point to the work from home environment. So that's pronounced widespread. We're seeing it across literally all markets. It's provided an additive driver to the amount of activity that we're seeing. One of the things that we do on a regular basis to survey new customers coming into properties, and in 2020, one of the areas that was more pronounced was customers needing more space at home. So clearly ties to the entire work from home environment that's new and different through 2020. Likely to stay through a good chunk of 2021 and beyond because, frankly, I think many components of work from home are here for a much longer period of time than we might have predicted. Another thing that's been additive, home sales have been quite vibrant, even from a seasonality standpoint, we're seeing much more activity this time of the year than we normally do. So that too is added to the amount of activity and the overall demand that we're seeing across many markets. There's really been no distinction from activity in suburban versus urban areas. Frankly, it's highly consistent in both regard. So we're keeping a close track on many different cross currents. But overall business, as Tom noted, is quite good. Jeffrey Spector : That's very helpful. And our second question is on acquisitions and your comment on the vibrant pipeline. To ask, are you getting more aggressive? Is underwriting changed? Are you focused on new markets or moving out, like there just more sellers? What has changed on that? We're excited? What's changed on the acquisition pipeline? Joe Russell : Yes, Jeff. The acquisition environment, as I know, has been quite robust. And if you step back, even going to 2019, we started to see an increase of the amount of sellers that were coming to market many of whom had come into the self-storage industry over the last, say, four or five years. There's no question there's been a much more vibrant amount of new owners coming into the sector. Some of whom weren't intending to stay in the sector for a long period of time. So you've got some churn tied to that. You've also got a number of assets that have been built at historic volume levels over the last three or four years, many of which have not hit either occupancy or revenue pro forma expectations, that too has motivated a number of sellers to bring assets to market. We've been controlling the markets as we typically do very actively. And then in 2020, we saw a sizable uptick in opportunities, many of which that fit the explanation I just described on the types of sellers that are coming to market. The other thing that we've found an interesting opportunity to expand into buying assets that may not be highly stabilized or looking for a different level of value creation. So in 2020, the average occupancy of the assets we bought was approximately 65%. That speaks to the fact that these are newer assets. They haven't gone through a full lease-up cycle and sellers have been frustrated in many cases and not patient enough to want to take them through that full cycle. So we've been able to open up some very interesting opportunities tied to that. And the $580 million that we have either closed or are in contract for 2021 is a reflection of all those issues. The average occupancy of those assets is about the same, which is in the mid-60% range. Combination of one-off and some smaller portfolios, nothing as large as beyond portfolio that we closed in the fourth quarter, but our acquisition team continues to control markets, and they're very well known. We've got deep relationships. We're seeing a combination of both marketed and off market opportunities. And we're looked upon as a preferred buyer. So Tom spoke to the fact that the capital structure is well primed, and we're frankly just seeing a much larger set of opportunities. Operator : Your next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : To echo Jeff's comments, thank you at kudos to the improved disclosure. I guess one question for me would be on the balance sheet which you just referenced, Joe. And how are you thinking about the firepower there? And are you wedded to the A-rated balance sheet? Or is that not necessarily something that you're wedding or at this point? Joe Russell : Sure. Maybe I'll start from, then Tom can give you some more color. We have a clear advantage because we do have an A credit rating. And with that, as we've been able to do in many different issuances, whether through the preferred or institutional bond market, we're able to tap into a pool of investors who love the credit rating, they're very attracted to the Company as a whole. And we enjoy very strong both demand and we've been able to issue record low rates and yields on these instruments. Now the other thing is we've got a lot of capacity in our current structure. Tom can give you more color on that. So we're not concerned about tipping into something less than an A credit rating, but we'll give you a little perspective on that. Tom Boyle : Yes, sure. Thanks, Joe. I think looking back over the last five years, you can see that we have financed our external growth, both acquisitions and developments, really with retained cash flow we have about $200 million to $300 million a year as well as unsecured debt. And that gives us a good amount of capacity in firepower each and every year to grow the business and accretively drive external growth performance without needing to raise equity.  And that's a good long-term sustainable FFO growth engine. So we think we do have a good mount of capacity there. And as Joe said, we have very good access across the capital markets, and we demonstrated that again in January with a five-year bond offering, sub-1% on the coupon. So, good access and cost, and we look forward to utilizing it to finance the external growth that Joe mentioned. Juan Sanabria : And one quick follow-up for me, in the disclosure, you talked about G&A increasing year-over-year adding some headcount. So just curious on what areas of the the enterprise you're adding people to? And what's the focus of that? What are you looking to build out? Tom Boyle : Sure. I think, in particular, I think you might be highlighting the centralized management costs and the comment that we increased headcount there. That is just deepening the bench across many of our centralized management functions, be it information technology, human resources, pricing and marketing, data analytics, really down the list. Folks really are responsible for centrally managing and supporting our field teams. So just deepening of the bench and overall those teams are really important to the success of the organization. Operator : Your next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : I also appreciate the increased disclosure this quarter. First question. Just looking at the core FFO that you reported in the quarter, 293, what headwinds should we be thinking about moving into the the first quarter and throughout the year, just given the lack of seasonality experienced in the fourth quarter and so far early in '21 that you discussed that would detract from sort of core FFO going forward here in terms of the run rate. Is there anything specific that we should be thinking about? Tom Boyle : Sure. This is Tom. Thanks, Todd. I think there's really a couple of things as we look out over the horizon into 2021 that we view as potential headwinds, I mentioned them briefly. One of them is move-outs. As we move through 2020, it was really a unique environment that we've spoken about on previous calls, where the customer behavior shifted as we moved into April and May and really persist through the year, across customer vintages, geographies, customer segments, where length of stays went longer and move-outs declined. And you can see that in our disclosures. That's one area that we do anticipate is likely to moderate as we move through 2021. Maybe it's into 2022. I mean it's uncertain as to when we do see that moderation. So far to start this year, we've continued to see very strong existing customer performance and lower move-outs. But we would anticipate that at some point, customer behavior returns to pre pandemic levels. And we see move-outs start to accelerate. So that's number one. The second one is the lingering impact of state of emergency pricing restrictions. And those impact our ability to increase move in rents as well as existing tenant price increases over time. And as those linger and we navigate through the dynamic health care environment that we have for the past year, that's a risk. We'll have to see. There's a myriad of different regulations across different states. Probably most notably here in the state of California, which is a good portion of our portfolio, and we'll -- that's an unpredictable element of rate restriction. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then I wanted to see if you could comment on CapEx spend. It looks like it's expected to ramp up to about $250 million in '21, which is up from 2020 levels, but still well below peers as sort of a percent of NOI or a percent of EBITDA. How do you think about CapEx spend? And is there an opportunity to increase that further? And I guess sort of what's the governor on CapEx spend that -- is there anything preventing you from sort of touching more stores more quickly? Joe Russell : So yes, Todd, I'll speak to a component of that, and then Tom can give you more color as well. But our property of tomorrow program is part of that increased spend in 2020 for a number of reasons, particularly tied to slower permitting process, availability of officials that do the overall improvements of the types of changes that we're making through the program. We were unable to tap as much volume and to pull or cover that program as full force is into many markets as we expected at the beginning of 2020. We've regrouped, we have a much more clear runway in 2021, we're going to be touching many more assets through the year. And we may actually find ways to accelerate it as we go deeper into the year. But at the moment, that's major component of the increase in spend. Tom Boyle : Yes. And if you break down the $250 million that we anticipate, about $130 million of that, we anticipate to be the property of tomorrow spend that Joe highlighted, around $75 million of of your regular maintenance CapEx and another $40 million, $50 million of energy efficiency driven capital expenditures. And I would highlight, we do break out the maintenance CapEx and provide some disclosure on that in the 10-K, even away from the development and acquisition CapEx on the cash flow statement. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Tom, I was wondering if you could spend a little bit more time on the balance sheet and just kind of following up on Juan's question. You have a lot of preferreds that have call dates coming up in the next, I think it's maybe 18 months. And I'm just curious your thoughts on your willingness to use more long-term unsecured debt to maybe take out some of those higher cost preferreds? Joe Russell : Sure. You're right, Steve, to highlight the fact that one of the great features of preferred stock is that it's both perpetual as well as has a five-year call. And so a lot of the preferreds that were issued back in in 2016 are now coming up for potential redemption. At the time they were issued, I think they were viewed as pretty darn attractive for handled preferreds, but in this environment, certainly a great opportunity to redeem that perpetual capital. And so we did a little bit of that in January, as you saw, we redeemed $300 million of a series that was at 5.4%. We did issue five-year bonds in January. As I've noted before, we'll monitor different markets and have the ability to use both a new preferred stock at lower rates as well as unsecured debt to finance the business as well as the redemption activity going forward. But clearly, second prong of the balance sheet that I spoke about earlier, it will be a powerful one as we move through both '21 and into the beginning of '22. Steve Sakwa : And maybe just a follow-up on just kind of leverage overall. I mean you're committed clearly to the A rating, but where does that sort of leave you on a net debt to maybe net debt plus preferred to EBITDA, sort of how high can that number go? And theoretically, still maintain the A rating? Joe Russell : Sure. I would highlight some disclosure we put in on leverage in the supplemental on net debt plus preferred. The different rating agencies use different metrics, but I would -- just to pick one, pick S&P who looks at a net debt plus preferred of 4.5x, which is over a turn higher than where we are now as a guidepost for single A ratings. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Great. And then just maybe by market, there were some interesting trends in Q4. Some of them that have been super weak in multifamily, and we've seen some drawdowns in office. We're reasonably strong for you, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and some of the markets that are benefitting down in the south were a bit weaker. Maybe that's supply, maybe there's something else going on. Just any thoughts on maybe the coastal gateway markets against kind of the Sunbelt markets? Joe Russell : Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we're really not seeing a material change in urban versus suburban and even coastal versus Midwest markets, the markets you spoke to, specifically, we're seeing overall very good demand. Literally, every one of our markets improved in occupancy in the quarter. And we continue to see very good and sustained demand coming through not only our same-store portfolio, but the lease-up of our non-same-store is quite vibrant. The demand for self-storage has been very resilient through both the pandemic, and I think it reaffirms the attractiveness of the product itself. Supply though is still a factor in a number of markets. There's no question. And it has and will continue to be a headwind in the name markets that we've spoken to for the last two or three years as many markets have been burdened by oversupply. The Houston market, for instance, still is absorbing a lot of product, but we're seeing good traction though. And to your point on the Southeast Atlanta has got some headwinds around supply. Minneapolis, Florida, parts of New York, et cetera. But at the same time, demand is quite healthy. So we're very pleased with the amount of lease up that's going on. And we're very pleased with the acceleration and stabilization of our non same-store portfolio. Operator : Our next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I guess, I wanted to ask just a little bit more around sort of pricing strategy if patterns return to more normal -- more normal in the back half of the year. Do you think in terms of maximizing revenues long term, would you be inclined to try to keep occupancies kind of more elevated with maybe less increases to existing customers? Or is there any sort of change around how you're thinking about sort of capitalizing on these high occupancy levels that you have right now? Joe Russell : Sure, Smedes. I mean, I guess I wouldn't highlight a particular occupancy or rate strategy for the back half of the year, given it's way too early to understand what the nature of the dynamics will be in the local submarkets with which we operate. I would highlight, clearly through 2020, we had the opportunity to anticipate lower move out volumes and lower inventory levels, which led to accelerating pricing, really starting in the second quarter and then accelerating through the second half of the year and now into the first quarter as well. So I think it's really been a rate focused strategy at this point given the low inventory levels, and that's been combined with lower promotional discounts, which we disclosed as well as lower marketing expense. As we move into the back half of 2021, if the picture you're painting is one where occupancy starts to fall significantly because of increased move out activity that will definitely change the dynamics in the local market. But I think one of the key components that we'd have to understand is whether the durability of consumer demand that we're seeing now persists because that is a really strong and powerful driver to revenue growth and overall move-in rates and accommodations to customers. So we're ultimately looking to maximize revenues, and we need to understand the nature of the move-ins and move outs. But clearly, it's a combination of both occupancy and rent and operating trends continue to be quite good as we start 2021. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then I guess we were just also wondering if you have any sense of if there's been any change in the customer base in terms of maybe first-time users of storage or reaching a particular demographic that hasn't maybe used storage in the past? Any sort of color there that you've seen? Joe Russell : There's no question, Smedes, that's happening as we speak. When you look at the sector as a whole and then more specifically, what we're seeing in our own portfolio, there's been more adoption by newer generations of users, many of whom have never used self-storage before. So it's been a great way for them to use the product for the first time. We're seeing continued repeat customers as well. But generationally, there's been growing and deep adoption of the asset, and we're very encouraged by that. Operator : Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : So in regards to some of the dialogue you've had with investor, it seems like you're embracing some of those suggestions. And of course, you've made some board changes and better disclosure, better commentary on this call. And I won't rehash everything that they brought up, but the two big ones are capital deployment and balance sheet. I'm interested if there's been any type of kind of shift in mentality or business philosophy or how you see the investment universe? And what are some of the changes that we can expect to see from PSA and the magnitude because that's important? Joe Russell : Well, Ki Bin to speak to just interaction with all shareholders, we have and will continue to be in active dialogue with our entire shareholder base. And we are continuing to drive the business on many different fronts. As we've talked about, we've got very unique and commanding strategies and capabilities. We are clearly focused on tapping into many of those, and we'll give you even more perspective on that in our Investor Day on May 3. This is not coming from one specific event or one and very distinct change in strategy. It's something that we're very focused on from an evolution and opportunity standpoint. And the management team and I are very focused on delivering strong shareholder returns through a variety of very commanding strategies that we've identified, some of which we've spoken about today and more that we'll speak about in May. So we'll continue to be as transparent as we can be, and we welcome and continue to have very active dialogue with our shareholders. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And in regards to some of the Board changes, I'm just curious if there is -- or what kind of dynamic there would be between the new Board members, the Chairman and the management team and how this might compare to the past, if there is any difference? Joe Russell : Well, there is a difference because over the last two years, the Board has gone through a pretty strong level of refreshment. We've added seven new trustees. The Board has and will continue to be very focused on good governance. I'm very happy with the new trustees that have joined the Public Storage board of good strong collection of different backgrounds, different business perspectives. And collectively, we're working on many things together. And we'll continue to look to and seek very strong counsel from the Board as it evolves over time. As I mentioned, we've added seven new trustees. So prior to that, the average tenure of the Board was 11 to 12 years. Now, it's about four. So with that comes, new ideas, new perspectives, and I'm very pleased with the overall caliber and focus at the Board at large has on the Company's direction and all the strategic initiatives that we're focused on. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Great. I echo the sentiment on the supplemental, very helpful. Just a quick one from me. Just going back to the supply question, very helpful calling out some of the markets. But maybe as asking in a different way, if we think about sort of the percentage of the portfolio, dealing with competitive new supply, maybe what is that number? And if not, just how do you expect that to trend this year and sort of in the out years going forward? Joe Russell : Yes, sure, Ron. So obviously, we've talked about now for the last two to three years. We've been in a very strong delivery pattern of new assets. You go back to 2017, about $4 billion of new assets were added to the market nationally. It ticked up in 2018 and '19, which, at the moment, feels like a peak, that was about $5 billion of deliveries. In 2020, as expected, we saw that taper down by about 10% to 12%, where now we're at 2021, and we're thinking that there's likely another 10% to 15% reduction in deliveries. It's come to different markets. It's had, as I mentioned earlier, some pretty detrimental impacts where it hit certain submarkets with an inordinate amount of oversupply. We're encouraged, however, that it's cyclically starting to taper down, but it's still with us. And even at a level this year, that could be somewhere between $3.5 or so billion to maybe $3.75 billion of deliveries, it's -- that's still a fair amount of new assets being delivered in many markets. As I mentioned, it has provided an opportunity for us to go out and acquire assets on one front. On our development platform, it's also given us a pocket of opportunity that we haven't seen until the last year or two, where we're actually not seeing as much competitive bidding on land sites. And it's creating another different opportunity that we uniquely enjoy because we do have an industry-leading development platform and our development teams out betting a higher level of land sites as we speak. So we're hopeful that, that continued decline of deliveries play through to counterbalance that. The self-storage sector is doing quite well. And funding is out there, and developers are still going to be encouraged in some areas to continue to put new product into markets. So we're tracking it actively. And we'll see how it plays through in the coming quarters. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Very helpful. My second question was just looking internationally, obviously with the stake in Shurgard, it could be really helpful if you could just compare and contrast sort of the experience you've seen with the storage product and COVID, maybe someone internationally in some of the markets you're familiar with versus what the U.S. went through? Joe Russell : Yes, I think I'd point you to, Shurgard has got vibrant disclosures, and they can give you much more color on what's going on in the European markets. But knowing and understanding what's been impacting their business. It has been similar in many ways to what we've seen here in the United States, which, again, is an elevated level of demand, new users coming into the product itself. And they, too, are seeing good business drivers, many similarities between what we're seeing here in the United States. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Just wondering, have you seen any significant benefits yet of having the third-party business, even though you've been for a fairly short time at this point? Joe Russell : Yes, Mike. Yes, it's definitely giving us a different lens on the industry. As I mentioned, currently, we've got the program up to 120 properties, a sizable percentage of the assets that are coming into our pipeline are development assets. So it's another view of how much of that activity is on the front lines in many markets. That's helpful. We've actually bought four assets thus far from the platform itself. So it can be many times a different relationship opportunity to identify and actually acquire assets. And it's always helpful to get outside feedback on the different operational methodologies that we use, the reaction we've got from owners, the way that they're looking at the performance of assets. So holistically, it's been very additive, and it's given us yet again a different perspective on the industry in many different ways. So we're encouraged about our opportunities going into this year. The pipeline continues to grow. It is not fully weighted, but it is heavily weighted around continued construction activity or development activity, but we're also finding a number of owners that have given us, say, one, two or three assets initially, and now they're giving us more. So it's another way for us to continue to build relationships, and we look forward to strengthening as relationships as we continue -- as the program continues to expand. Operator : Your next question is from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Rick Skidmore : Just a follow-up on the supply question just a few minutes ago. As you think about the lease-up of new and developed properties has been maybe extended four to five years and given the demand trends you're seeing, are you seeing that lease-up pace accelerate such that it might be a little faster than you think or maybe reverting back to prior periods where growth wasn't as rapid? Joe Russell : Yes, Rick, you're right. It is accelerating. We've been very pleased with even more near term, the assets that we delivered in 2019 and '20 are seeing much stronger demand and lease-up activity than we anticipated. So that's definitely encouraging. And as I mentioned, even if we're looking to some of the acquisitions that have lower levels of existing occupancy, we're seeing -- once we put those assets into our platform, really strong and acceleration from customer activity, lease-up and then we're stabilizing the asset in a shorter period of time. But frankly, and Tom's talked about this in prior calls as well. It is a product type that does take time to season from a revenue stabilization standpoint. But the quicker we are able to fill assets up and start maturing that revenue stream, the better off we are and putting, as we speak. Rick Skidmore : Got it. And then just on the demand side of the question, you mentioned some new millennial generation or younger generation utilizing storage a bit more, but you also -- Tom also talked a bit about move-outs reverting back to maybe a normal trend line. Maybe just frame how you think about demand as to whether it's changed over the longer term? Or is it just too early to tell if there's some trend that that's coming out of COVID with regards to how demand might move going forward? Tom Boyle : Sure. It's something, Rick, that we're watching very closely, both the composition, as Joe mentioned, based on survey data and customer activity. As we move through 2020. The good thing is it's been really durable, and the momentum has continued. So looking at top of funnel demand trends, web visits and sales calls are up 10% plus, and that's against an inventory backdrop, where occupancies are higher, vacancies are lower. And as Joe just mentioned, lease-up assets are filling up faster. So, a good environment to have strong top of funnel customer interest, IN terms of the types of customers or the use cases of storage, one of them that Joe highlighted that we saw really accelerate in the April and May time period was consumers that were not moving, but we're looking to free up some space in their home. And that use case has continued to trend higher than prior years throughout the year. In other words, it wasn't an April, May but it has persisted throughout. And those customers tend to be good storage customers as they utilize the storage space as an extension of their home and tend to have longer length of stays. So that's a nice backdrop and characterization of the demand that we've seen to date, and we'll support the occupancy and customer tenure here going forward. How long that lasts, is anybody's guess. But we've been encouraged by how persistent it's been through 2020 and into 2021. And as Joe mentioned, we do think some elements of the reaction to really individuals daily lives being disrupted through the pandemic will persist as we go forward, be it with the ability to work from home for more days or just generally spending more time at home. So we're encouraged by that, but no guidepost into the future as to what exactly or what day or time period those could shift. Operator : Your next question is from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : I heard some occupancy figures that I think may have been for the full year 2020, but I wanted to make sure if you broke out the Q4 deals and then facilities already acquired here in Q1. Joe Russell : Todd, are you specifically asking about acquisition deals or... Todd Stender : Sorry. Yes. I know it's a pretty geographically diverse set, but maybe just speak to occupancies and any color on rents maybe they're below market or at market? Any color there? Tom Boyle : Yes. I can maybe provide a little bit of color and then Joe can chime in too. But the fourth quarter, we did see some lower occupancy transactions. I think we had spoken in the past around how the portfolio came in at lower occupancies than the overall average, around 35%. And overall, the acquisitions in 2020, you're right, we're higher, around 65%. And as we moved into 2021, we're obviously only really talking about a quarter's worth of activity, but that's similar around that 65% And then in terms of rate, clearly, with many of the properties in earlier fill up stages, rates will be lower, and we'll have the opportunity over time to increase those rates as we go. Joe Russell : Yes. And maybe just to give you a little bit more color to, Todd, as I mentioned, the occupancy on average, speaks to the fact that many of these assets are relatively new. But overall, we've been very pleased with the quality level of the assets that we've been able to acquire over the last two years in particular, as I mentioned, many of these sellers are coming to market in a way that they have some level of reticence to stay in the sector, they're not necessarily achieving either pro forma revenues or occupancies, but the overall quality of the assets that we continue to see and acquire has been very good. Todd Stender : If they're generally new or does that suggest that the sellers do not need tax-efficient currency like an OP unit and you're just paying in cash? Joe Russell : Yes. Many of them are looking for cash. It could be because it's a single asset that they developed or maybe they've got other asset types that they need to put more capital into and the rebalancing a broader portfolio. So different circumstances, but many of these conversations have come over some period of time as we built relationships with these owners and through our deep connections even through the brokerage community, too. Operator : Our next question is from David Bragg with Green Street. David Bragg : On the expense side, could you provide some additional color on the role of the rental program and driving down payroll expenses? And are you expecting that rental utilization is going to remain elevated as we move toward a more normal environment? Joe Russell : So yes, David, the e rental channel, as I mentioned, has been quite vibrant. Customers are really drawn to it. We think that the sustainability and the utility of that channel will definitely go beyond whatever pandemic environment, driving our whatever pandemic related activity may be leading customers to use it because, frankly, we designed it and tested it before the pandemic. It was built around a very efficient and time-sensitive customer who wanted to be much more oriented toward a self-service transaction. So we've really seen good adaptability and adoption by customers. It's now approximately 50% of our move-in process. And to your point, it will likely have different kinds of beneficial impacts as we continue to study our operational model and the way that it too provides a different level of service to customers. We'll talk more about this in our Investor Day in May, but we're definitely very encouraged by the success of that channel so far and look forward to continue to optimize it. David Bragg : Great. Just quick follow-up. It seems like work from home demand, you're expecting to be relatively sticky moving forward. As we think about potential move-outs, what are particular areas where you're concerned? Is it potentially small business demand moving out as we move towards a normal environment? Or are there other areas where we should be keeping in mind Tom Boyle : As I noted earlier, the change in move out ratio really was across customer segments, customer tenures, pre pandemic, during pandemic customers, business, consumer and the like. So the shift was not isolated in one. And so as we think about consumer behavior, moving back to historical norms or closer to historical norms, there's no question that, that could just as easily be across the full spectrum. But as we noted, we have not seen that to date. And we'll certainly update the investment community when we do start to see that, but we've been encouraged starting 2021. Operator : Your final question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Joe, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about sort of the stakes in Shurgard and PSB. And just as you've interacted with shareholders and analysts, whether sort of any of that is on the table in terms of distribution or a sale, the combined stakes in those two companies today is almost $3.6 billion, high single-digit of your gross asset value. I guess, how do you think about those stakes longer term? Joe Russell : Yes, Michael, I would step back and tell you that we are supporters of both platforms. We're very pleased with the individual performance of each of those businesses. There are a variety of reasons why we have and do maintain our investment level in them. And ultimately, and to what degree that changes over time, I wouldn't speak to directly, but we're very pleased with our investment and the success of each of those entities. Michael Bilerman : But I guess does that capital on your balance sheet makes sense. I think probably more so, I can understand the Shurgard, Europe side is a global business, but does the PSD stake makes sense? Joe Russell : It's -- like I mentioned, Michael, I would just leave it as it's been, and we feel a good investment on our behalf. And that's as much color as I can give at this point. It would be strategically as it would be in any different investment that we have, something that we could continue to evaluate. And as any shift in focus or commitment takes place, we would certainly bring that forth. But at this point, I don't have anything to share with you. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then just on the management program, do you have sort of maybe just some details around how many different owners you have in that group, maybe some clarity on what those represent out of the 120, more sort of the top five in there? Or is it spread out amongst singles and doubles and triples? Joe Russell : Yes. It's beginning with singles, doubles and triples. But as I mentioned, as the business evolves, we're actually starting to see a number of owners that have anywhere from, say, 10, 20 or 30 or more assets. And they're giving us the opportunity to basically display and show the kind of performance that those assets are able to attain under our own platform. We've seen good traction. And I think over time, that's a different way for the program to continue to evolve. The business as a whole is very reference oriented. So that matters. And that's something that, over time, as we show and display the amount of performance of these assets are able to attain under our own platform, I think will be very additive, and we're actually starting to see some of that as we speak. Michael Bilerman : Great. And I appreciate making opening comments on the call. I appreciate having a supplemental and sort of coming in line with the industry. It's nice to see the Company take action amongst the comments that have been provided by the investment community time and being a little bit more outward with some of that. So definitely appreciate the change in a lot of things that you're doing and implementing. Joe Russell : Great. Thanks for the feedback. Appreciate it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Ryan Burke for additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Erica. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your time. We appreciate your interest. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Angela. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle.  Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 29, 2021, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement these statements they become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we've applied on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our earnings release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com.  We do ask that you initially limit yourself to 2 questions. Of course, if you have more beyond that, please feel free to jump back in the queue. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, we continue to wish everyone good health as we all face the many impacts from the pandemic.  This morning, Tom and I will begin the call by covering a few areas tied to Q1 performance, along with our inaugural guidance for 2021. As you know, on May 3, we are hosting an Investor Day virtually and hope you can join us. We will share our key strategies and introduce you to the executive leadership team that will drive our growth in the coming years.  Looking at Q1, a number of historic metrics play through. Customer demand for self-storage has remained elevated. We continue to see consistent customer behavior across all markets with increased move-in rates, extended customer length of stay and more latitude to resume traditional rate increases to existing customers. Demand has been tied to both historic drivers coupled with the longer-lasting impacts from more consumers needing storage. This includes work-from-home, study-from-home, elevated home sales and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets.  With the economy improving and additional government stimulus, consumer balance sheets are healthy and our customers' payment patterns remain strong. Both same-store and non-same-store assets are performing well. With lease ups, particularly in non-same-store assets outpacing our projections as NOI grew by 46%. To investments, 2021 is shaping up to be a robust year of acquisition activity. With the addition of the recently announced ezStorage portfolio, our year-to-date 2020 acquisition activity either closed or under contract is $2.5 billion. Of note, since 2019, we have acquired, developed and redeveloped approximately 22 million square feet and have expanded our portfolio by 13%, having invested $4.3 billion.  In regard to the ezStorage acquisition, I would like to mention a few highlights of this significant transaction and how it matched 4 specific areas tied to our unique capabilities. First, the integration of the assets into the Public Storage brand and operating platform will be seamless as we already had a broad presence in these markets with 115 assets. We now enjoy even stronger presence with now 163 assets with unmatched brand presence across the mid-Atlantic region.  Second, 8 of the ezStorage assets are poised for expansion, along with 1 that has begun ground-up development. The Public Storage development team has taken lead on these opportunities and is ready to execute on each one of them, allowing us to expand the portfolio by approximately 10% over the next 24 months.  As you know, Public Storage has the only development team among the self-storage REITs and is well poised to unlock more value from this portfolio by virtue of our unique development capabilities. Third, our ability to fund a large acquisition and close in a very short time line, in this case, 6 weeks from selection to close was due to our efficient and primed capital structure. This transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and NOI. And fourth, our well-earned reputation of being a buyer of choice in the investment community. I want to thank the Manganaro family and the ezStorage team for choosing Public Storage and the great work they put into this outstanding portfolio over the last 2-plus decades.  We appreciate their assistance in integrating this outstanding portfolio into our platform and welcome many of their employees and customers to Public Storage. Looking to full 2021, we are encouraged by core customer demand, our well-located portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality and dedication of the 5,000-plus team members at Public Storage, all of whom are committed to enhancing the leading brand in the self-storage industry. With that, let me hand the call over to Tom. Thomas Boyle : Thanks, Joe. I'll start with financial performance. Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021. In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 2.6% from the fourth quarter. There were two primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move-in rates were up double digits, while move-out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, leading to improving in-place rents. Secondly, occupancy also increased through the quarter with move-in volume down but move-out volume also lower. Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the first quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property tax specifically, we will expense our estimate ratably through the year, leading to a benefit in the first 3 quarters and reversing to a headwind in the fourth quarter.  This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter property tax in the future. The benefit this quarter was worth $0.05 of FFO. Some of the technology and operating model evolution we'll discuss on Monday at our Investor Day, showed up in our first quarter numbers, with property payroll down 13% in the quarter, given efficiency improvements. We look forward to sharing more on Monday.  For the first time, we included 2021 core FFO guidance in our earnings release and supplement. In conjunction with the line-by-line commentary in our supplemental, it's a guide to our outlook and the key drivers of our business. And as we started 2021, we've seen continued strength, as Joe mentioned, in customer demand, with occupancies up 260 basis points and in-place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January.  We anticipate same-store revenue to grow from 4% to 5.5% in 2021. That outlook is supported by good customer demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to move-outs going higher as we move through the year comping against what was really extraordinary existing tenant performance in 2020.  Our current expectations are for occupancy to be down 100 basis points plus in the fourth quarter compared to 2020. We expect continued strong expense control in the same-store in 2021. Our expectations are for 1% to 2% same-store expense growth. Property tax expense growth will pick up this year with our expectations around a 5% increase for the year, again, recognized ratably through the year.  Our guidance includes the acceleration of our external growth initiatives with ezStorage and will add to FFO growth through our non same-store portfolio this year and next. In total, our outlook is for core FFO per share of $11.35 to $11.75 for 2021.  I'll now shift gears to the balance sheet. As Joe mentioned, we used our growth-oriented balance sheet to fund the purchase of ezStorage entering the bond market the day after announcement and having fully funded the transaction within 2 days. The offering comprised of 3, 7 and 10 year tranches with a weighted average cost of about 1.6%.  After effect of the transaction, we have the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with 1 of the lowest cost profiles. And we remain in a great position to continue to use the balance sheet to fund our growth initiatives, and we'll share more at our Investor Day on Monday. With that, I'll turn it over to Angela to open the line up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jeffrey Spector : First question is just really the main incoming investor question we get, and it's around the customers, demand drivers, and Joe, you discussed this, I guess, in your opening remarks a bit. But -- and then again, you talked about a decrease in occupancy in the fourth quarter.  Can you just, I guess, dig in a little bit more on why you feel the customer -- some of the drivers we saw last year may fade? And can you confirm the 100 bps drops in the fourth quarter, is that just normal seasonality? How does that compare to normally what you see in the fourth quarter? Joseph Russell : Yes, Jeff. One of the things that is hard to predict, even going out another couple of quarters is what could revert to some degree to what you would call normal seasonality. So to Tom's point, we're looking at that as a potential event, but still to be determined. As we've seen now for the last several quarters, the sustainability of consumer and business demand for that matter has been quite elevated.  As I noted, there are consistent market trends, literally in every area that we operate in the business right now. And consumers continue to look for and need storage for a whole host of both traditional and, I would say, new and different reasons. We're encouraged by the fact that there's even generationally entirely new pool of customers coming to storage for the first time. We think that can be additive as well. And as we've seen with home sales, as I mentioned, the additional pickup of the economy, overall demand has been quite healthy, and we feel it's sustainable, but could be impacted for more seasonality reasons, closer to the end of the year, but to be determined. Jeffrey Spector : And then my second question just on acquisitions and new facilities. How should we think about, I guess, specific target markets for you and how that fits in with your current portfolio plus the ezStorage portfolio? Joseph Russell : Well, one of the benefits that we clearly have had over time and this isn't new to the way that we're uniquely positioned nationally is we have deep presence literally in every major metropolitan market across the United States. We're on the ground. We're dealing with a lot of very vibrant data relative to knowledge of other owners, the traction that we're seeing in markets, the way that we balance, the focus that we've got on going deeper in any particular market.  And looking at the ezStorage acquisition, as I noted, we already had a top ownership position in that market by quite a large margin. The ezStorage portfolio was highly regarded and was known nationally as a very top-tier national operator, by virtue of pulling those 48 assets on top of what we already had, which was a very strong presence in that market. We were able to magnify our presence there quite dramatically.  And that could play through in many other markets nationally, whether it's on something as sizable as ezStorage or something more limited from a specific asset base, whether it's a single or a smaller portfolio or one that could be more widespread. Give you another example in the fourth quarter of 2020, we bought the Beyond Storage portfolio, unlike the ezStorage portfolio, the Beyond Storage portfolio was in multiple markets, but again, very easy for us to integrate, very easy for us to underwrite. And we had very good ability to move quickly which leads to the fact that we are, without question, a preferred buyer.  And with that, the team continues to see a very strong collection of different opportunities nationally. We're seeing good quality of assets come into the markets. I would say about half of them come to us privately off-market and the other half, more through traditional means, but we've got very good relationships, deep seated, by virtue of the fact that we've been and operate in these markets and have a very strong reputation as a preferred buyer. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the same-store revenue growth. And maybe if you could just give us any more context with regards to the cadence as you built in through the year, your assumptions for the full year. Maybe if you can provide some color on the low versus high end and what's assumed at those 2 extremes? And what the benefit is from easier comps on the fee business, which has been a drag for the last few quarters? Thomas Boyle : Yes, sure, Juan. There's a lot there to unpack. So let me pace through that. Starting with the last one first, which is fees. So that has been a drag in each of the quarters since the onset of the pandemic. And so you started to see that really take hold in the second quarter of last year. And so we will have lapped that comp. We do anticipate, as Joe mentioned, continued strong payment activity. So we don't think that those fee collections will -- those fees will be charged or collected for the remainder of the year, but we won't be comping against the previous year where we had been collecting them.  So that should go away from a comp standpoint in the next 3 quarters. In terms of cadence through the year, I mentioned the occupancy point in the fourth quarter in our base case. And I think that, that is really driven, as Joe mentioned, by typical seasonality as we get into the second part of the year. We'd anticipate that as the economy starts to open up, we see more governors talking about getting back to normal through the summer period and employers encouraging folks to get back into the office as we move through the summer and into the fall. We would anticipate a more seasonal pattern to reemerge and occupancies to fall like they do in any typical year as we move into the third and fourth quarter. In terms of any other items I'd highlight as we talked about last year, one of the drivers of the drop in in-place rents last second quarter, in particular, was the fact that we had paused on our existing tenant rate increase program. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are executing on that plan throughout the year this year. So we will have easy comps from an existing tenant rate increase program standpoint in the second quarter. But then we did resume those last year in the third and fourth. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then I was just hoping if you could provide any color on what you're seeing on street rates for new customers in terms of net effective and how that's trended through April, just to give us a sense of how seasonality is trending to date? Thomas Boyle : Yes. Well, we continue to see very strong demand trends, as Joe mentioned earlier. The move-in rates in the first quarter were up nearly 16% year-over-year, and those were comping pre pandemic 2020. As we moved into April, we obviously are now comping the onset of the pandemic last year where we did see reduced customer demand and lower move-in rates. So move-in rates year-over-year through April are up 40% plus. And I think the most encouraging thing is we start to look at a typical seasonal pattern. We're looking at 2019 as a benchmark, and our April move-in rents are up double digits versus April 2019 as well, indicating that continued positive trajectory of rents and good performance there. So we continue to be encouraged by customer demand. And frankly, we have limited inventory within the same-store pool. So rates are going higher. Juan Sanabria : 40% sounds pretty good to me. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Todd Thomas : First question, just circling back to investments. I'm just trying to tease through some of the comments that you've made, Joe, and the $200 million of incremental acquisitions that are embedded in the guidance. It seems a little bit light relative to the pace you're on, even excluding the ezStorage deal.  Are you expecting a slowdown in the near-term because you have to hit the pause button to digest a little bit? Or is there just a lack of visibility at this time based on what's in the market with maybe last coming to market after a flurry of activity here. Can you comment on that? Joseph Russell : Yes, Todd, there -- it's a little more related to the latter. No, we're well primed and continue to add assets to the platform very easily. And the acquisition team seeing good opportunities, as I talked about a few minutes ago. So it's just, again, a hard metric to look at from a continued elevated level of activity, but we're seeing good quality assets. We've got a lot of activity going on. It's competitive. We're still focusing on quality assets, quality markets and properties that we know that can be accretive and additive to the overall platform, but we're confident that we're going to continue to see good activity there. It's just the predictability, and from a competitive standpoint, what we're going to face as we go deeper into the year.  As Tom has noted, what the balance sheet is more than well primed to continue to support our acquisition and development activity. And with that, we'll continue to seek out and find and pursue many different types of opportunities, whether they're portfolio related or on a one-off basis.  If you look at the $500-or-so million that we've got in our acquisition pipeline. As we speak, it's more oriented toward either one-off or smaller concentrations of assets. That's the consistent playbook that is always in our mix. And then what can be more unpredictable is just what can come through in the larger portfolios.  So we still think we're in very good shape to continue to pursue opportunities, but we'll see how that plays through as the year goes on. But very pleased by the amount of volume, certainly, that we've been able to capture not only in Q1, but going through 2020 as a whole and then, as I mentioned, off to a very good start this year. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then just thinking geographically, obviously, the ezStorage deal was a little bit more concentrated. Is there a focus looking out on adding exposure in certain markets or regions, whether because of maybe certain demographic changes or accelerated -- accelerating trends in certain markets? Or is it more based on quality of asset and what's generally available for transaction purposes? Joseph Russell : Yes. Obviously, you can't manufacture sales opportunities in and of itself. But we are very intentional on where we're putting priorities, where we're looking to either expand each area of the business based on the trends that we see, where we continue to see very strong advantage by enhanced scale. Looking at the ezStorage portfolio, as I mentioned, we already had a commanding size portfolio there. This made it even more attractive from a scale and presence standpoint. But we're also out looking to increase our presence in other markets as well. We recently went into Boise, Idaho. We've never been in Boise before.  We were able to capture a very nice 6-asset portfolio in that market. So we're looking deep in the markets that we've been in traditionally, and we're looking at markets that we see good growth opportunities as well. Todd Thomas : Okay. And just a quick last question. You haven't sold in saying really previously or really at all over the course of the last decade or 2 or 3. And I normally -- it's around dispositions, but some strategic changes around certain parts of the business and capital allocation strategy in recent years. And I'm just curious if -- just given the demand for assets, if you're contemplating any asset sales or dispositions in order to either sort of call or prune the portfolio at all? Joseph Russell : That's an ongoing evaluation that we do, Todd. I wouldn't point you to any specific area and/or type of asset or portfolio that we own, I would say, is a candidate to look for disposition at the -- at this point, but it's something that we continue to evaluate. And if circumstances and our own perspective has changed, we think that's beneficial. We'll certainly execute on that for it, too. But nothing to speak to on that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask you just a little bit on AutoPay, which I think you've said is 1 reason why you've seen this decline in late fees, and it sounds like that's kind of structurally lower going forward. But do people who go on AutoPay tend to stay longer? And is that kind of an opportunity across your portfolio? I don't know what percentage is already on AutoPay. Joseph Russell : Sure. Thanks, Smedes. The ONE thing I'd highlight is we think it was above and beyond AutoPay change as we moved into April. Our AutoPay was pretty consistent through the months of February, March, April, May last year, but we saw a significant acceleration in payment patterns at the onset of the pandemic. So I wouldn't point to AutoPay specifically.  That said, AutoPay has been trending higher over the last several years, and we expect it to continue to, given our e-rental platform, which now comprises about half of our move-in volumes today and that auto enrolls folks into AutoPay if they elect that move-in method.  And so we do anticipate that AutoPay will increase. But it's not really the main driver of what we've seen on customer payment patterns. I think that's more consumer balance sheets being excellent and some of the operational processes we put around and at the time of the pandemic. Smedes Rose : And have you seen any differences though between folks who are on AutoPay, who aren't in terms of how long they stay? Or is it not meaningful? Joseph Russell : AutoPay is certainly one of the things we look at from a customer composition standpoint. People that select AutoPay have a certain characteristic associated with them, both demographics and psychographics and the like. And so it's not necessarily selecting AutoPay that makes them be a customer of a certain type. It's the folks that generally select AutoPay tend to have certain characteristics, but that's something we watch very closely as we look to understand our customer. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then I just want to ask you, you mentioned price restrictions that's still in place in some regions. Does that meaningfully restrict in your ability to really pass along price increases? Or are the upper limits kind of above where you would normally be anyway? I'm just trying to think about -- around your guidance like if some of those got listed, is there upside there? Or is it not all that impactful right now? Joseph Russell : Yes. Thanks, Smedes. That's a great question. We've been talking about pricing restrictions through the pandemic, but many of those restrictions have started to fade away which is encouraging. So as we think about it on a year-over-year basis, 2021 is a better pricing regulatory environment than 2020 was. The one big notable state of emergency pricing restriction that's in place, and it has been for the last several years now is in Los Angeles County and several other counties here in California related to fires that have taken place over the last several years.  So Los Angeles is our largest market. And we've been restricted on pricing because of Section 396 in California since the fall of 2018. So that remains in place. It's not scheduled to expire until December 31. So it doesn't factor into our guidance per se, but it remains a headwind in Los Angeles. And you can see Los Angeles is doing quite well, but it's certainly not seeing the same level of revenue growth that we are in some of our other markets, given some of the pricing restrictions there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of with Samir Khanal with ISI. Samir Khanal : Joe, just one more on the acquisition front. I know we talked about sort of the U.S. and domestically. But I guess, internationally, just curious what does that opportunity set look like for you guys as well? Joseph Russell : Well, we have certainly the bandwidth and the knowledge of thinking outside borders. We've talked about this historically relative to our very strong and, I would say, deep knowledge base that came from the platform in Europe. Obviously, that's Shurgard and the things that we've taken away and learned from portfolio like that and how it's grown over time and how it's been able to do quite well throughout the Western European markets. So the skill set is resident here in the company. We continue to track a number of different markets outside U.S. borders and when certain opportunities present themselves and/or we think it's an appropriate opportunity for us to expand outside, we're well suited to do so. Samir Khanal : And I guess my second question is just shifting over to the supply picture over the next 12 to 18 months. When considering how strong fundamentals are, I mean, developers are not slowing down. How do you think about supply picture, let's say, 12, 18 months down the road? Joseph Russell : That's something that we're watching closely. Development nationally peaked in 2019 were plus or minus about $5 billion of new assets were developed and delivered. It tapered down in 2020 by about 15% or so. In 2021, we're predicting another leg down in that 10% to 15% range again. Going into 2022, it's always a little bit more cloudy to figure out what could play through. We do think that this, however, has been a very good cycle for us to continue to find and source land sites with less competitive activity out there. Our development team is very busy sourcing those kinds of opportunities.  So it's been a good window for us actually to jump in and look for land sites, either that have or have not been through different levels of entitlements. And we're going to continue to look for and extract very good value from our development activities, where we typically are able to drive the highest return on invested capital through the investment that we put into development and/or redevelopment.  So we're uniquely positioned to do so. As I mentioned, we have the only development platform in the public arena, and by far, we have the biggest development team in the self-storage industry. It's national. We're deep, great relationships, just like we're able to tap into on the acquisition front. And we'll continue to monitor and see what kind of continued activity play through from the development activity that's going on right down to individual submarkets and then nationally as well. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Richard Hill : I'm on for Ron Kamdem today. I think you're painting a pretty good picture about growth over the medium term, maybe even long term. So I wanted to maybe take a step back and unpack internal versus external growth. As you think about internal growth, can you maybe talk through about the demand drivers that's coming from a millennial and Z generation that's just now entering to the household formation years and sort of how that plays into how you think about your ability to continue to push rent growth off record levels?  And then more importantly, I shouldn't say more importantly, but similarly, could you maybe talk about the external growth? And if there's other opportunities to acquire big portfolios like you've done over the past several years? Joseph Russell : So yes, Tom and I can kind of toggle and answer your questions. But I would say internally, we definitely do see the opportunity around maturing generational demand. There's been a consistent and confidently, we're optimistic about the type of demand factors that are now playing through in, again, the newer generation users, many of whom are actually coming to use storage for the exact same reasons, their predecessors did. So life events in general, needing more space, cost of housing, working from home in this particular environment, all the things that play through relative to changes in family dynamics, et cetera, are very powerful to the use case and continued adoption and absorption of self-storage nationally.  The Self Storage Association tracks this on an annual basis, and it has continued to grow over time, and we're confident it will do just that. And then on the external side, there's a good population of quality assets, many of which have been delivered, say, over the last 4 or 5 years, in particular, by individual developers that we've been able to tap.  We haven't been shy about buying assets that are less than stabilized. Our average occupancy of the assets that we have under contract, for instance, right now is about 50%. So there's a good pool of assets out there that are far from stabilization that have been good opportunities for us to go out and acquire.  We're still buying stabilized assets as well. But there's a healthy amount of inventory from a group of developers that have come into the self-storage sector for the first time weren't intending necessarily to be here for the long haul. And that has elevated our opportunity set to go out and acquire and be confident about our external growth, knowing that, that inventory level is quite strong, and the quality is quite good, too, in many cases.  Tom, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? Thomas Boyle : No, no. I think you covered it well. And I'd highlight we'll be spending more time on these topics on Monday for our Investor Day in some more detail. Richard Hill : Yes. That's helpful, guys. And ultimately -- what I'm ultimately getting at is we see a really favorable backdrop for the housing market. Certainly don't see any signs of a bubble despite some of the media narrative. So if HPA is going to remain, call it, in the mid-high single digits, what does that mean for your rent growth? And certainly, there's probably going to be some normalization from the record levels that you've seen. But it would seem to indicate that there's no reason you can't continue to capitalize at an above-inflation rate over the medium term. Is that a right characterization? Joseph Russell : If your predictions for home price appreciation and rent growth play out, storage is definitely linked to that as a space substitute for consumers. So all nice contributors to potential rent growth over time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : So when you look across the portfolio, there's probably a good mix of markets that never really shut down, some of that shutdown, but opened quickly and some are just kind of opening now. So would have kind of called that reopening cohorts. When you look at those mix of cities, is there any lessons to be learned that might confirm or give you confidence that occupancy could decline? Or maybe is that just being conservative? Joseph Russell : It's definitely something we're watching, Ki Bin. It's something, however, that hasn't, in any way, elevated to a noted change or a reversion to what may have been more normal in prior periods. If you look at Florida or Texas, for instance, I would say, two markets that have been on the early side of \"opening back up,\" we're actually seeing some of our healthiest demand drivers in those 2 states as we speak.  So even as either consumers or businesses are coming back into some level of normality, demand is still very good. In fact, if anything, it's percolating higher than it was on the early side of the pandemic. So it's a validation that there are other additive drivers that are going on, whether it's with the economy at large, home sales, in migration, all the other factors that can drive overall demand for storage.  And we've really seen no evidence yet that there's any change that would point to the fact that there's something reversing or that we're going to see any near-term anyway, something that would shift strongly that has, on the opposite side, been very additive to overall business metrics.  So we're watching closely right down to a submarket basis. But if you even take a look at Texas as a whole, whether it's Houston, Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, very good activity in all 4 cities. And we've got big presence in each and every 1 of them, going to South Florida, for instance, whether it's Miami or Tampa, again, very, very strong drivers there, too.  So we're tracking and keeping an eye on it, but it's a validation that the business is not only quite resilient, but it's -- from a product standpoint, consumers and businesses are looking for storage very actively right now. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. That's pretty encouraging to hear. The second question, you guys provided CapEx guidance, a bit higher than what we've been used to on a recurring CapEx. I'm not sure if I'm looking at this apples-to-apples, but wondering if you can provide any commentary around that? Joseph Russell : Sure. Happy to, Ki Bin. And we'll go into some of our CapEx plans on Monday as well. But I think if taking a step back the $250 million to $300 million that we disclosed for the year, it's higher than it has been in previous years, and it's really been driven by incremental activity tied to our Property of Tomorrow program and the acceleration of that program after we had slowed it down through the pandemic.  So if you think about the $250 million to $300 million, the building blocks there, about $75 million or so of regular maintenance CapEx, an additional, call it, $50 million to $60 million in solar and LED investments and then, call it, $120 million plus in Property of Tomorrow as we seek to accelerate that program and run it through our portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Balaguer with Green Street. David Balaguer : Sticking to development, just wanted to focus on construction costs a little bit as looking across property sectors, that's been a topic that seems to have hit most property sectors quite a bit. With your development platform, how much have you seen construction costs increase? And to what extent could that have an impact on supply moving forward? Joseph Russell : The one component that we're watching closely is steel cost, for instance. So there's been some volatility there and some price increases that we're keeping track of. Market to market, there could be some impacts from a labor standpoint. So it's fluid. It can be erratic in some cases and unpredictable as well. So it's definitely something that we're keeping a close eye on. I wouldn't say it's become some kind of an overarching headwind for somebody to either stop a potential development project or actually delay 1 indefinitely, but we'll see how those costs trend over time. But the 1 area that we're looking at more specifically right now is just steel costs. David Balaguer : Got it. And just a second follow-up question. For the acquisition subsequent to quarter end besides the EV storage acquisition, can you give us an idea on occupancy there and general lease-up time line compared to recent acquisition activity over the last couple of quarters? Joseph Russell : Yes. Again, the amount of occupancy roughly in the $500 million or so that's in our unclosed pipeline of acquisitions hovers around 50% or so. So it's a combination of assets, some of which are just coming to the market. So a few assets that we're going to take very low levels of occupancy to others that are much higher and I would call them more stabilized. But it's a range. As I noted, we have not been shy about bringing those kinds of assets into the portfolio. Frankly, we need more space to lease-up. So it's been a good opportunity for us to pull those assets into the portfolio, put them into our operating platform, and we're seeing very good and, I would say, better-than-expected performance based on the environment that we're dealing with. So we're looking for and finding good quality there and aren't hesitant to buy assets that have the lease-up that maybe others are not as comfortable with. So we're seeing good opportunity set there, and we'll continue to hunt for those kinds of assets. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Probably for Tom, with the $2 billion in bonds, you used to fund the $1.8 billion for ezStorage, just seeing where you sit right now as far as sources and uses and what you're budgeting for the remainder of the year as far as external capital? Thomas Boyle : Yes, sure. So we weren't able to get into the bond market pretty quickly post the ezStorage transaction for the $2 billion. And as Joe mentioned, we continue to see good opportunities for acquisition volumes. And as you're highlighting with sources and uses, if those volumes continue to percolate, we'd anticipate we'll likely access the bond market in the second half of the year, and that's embedded into the interest expense guidance that we released yesterday afternoon. Todd Stender : Got it. And then when we look at these coupons for the debt across those 3 tranches, does that start to make the cost of preferreds not competitive right now? Is that fair to say? Thomas Boyle : Well, the duration of those and the features of them are quite different. And so as we look at preferred costs around 4%, certainly, the 3-year bond that we did about 0.75%, very different in cost, but also very different in profile. And so we'll talk more about balance sheet strategy on Monday, but we continue to like preferred stock as a cornerstone of the capital structure, but we've been adding lower cost and shorter-dated duration to spread the maturity profile out over time and diversify our sources of financing. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Just two quick ones here. One, Tom, appreciate the CapEx breakdown. Can you talk about like which are the extra components about the non -- the normal core stuff, the solar, the Property of Tomorrow. Like how many years do you see that stuff recurring? Thomas Boyle : Sure. So Property of Tomorrow, and we'll go into some detail on this on Monday. We see continuing over the next several years as we roll that through the rest of the portfolio. And then we have a good runway, particularly on solar. LED, we're moving through the portfolio pretty quickly through last year and this year on an interior basis. In the prior 3 years, we were doing exterior LED. So we've got some more LED activity maybe for the next year or 2, but then that will really subside. But solar we see the opportunity to put that on half or more of our portfolio over time, and we're just scratching the surface there. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of looking at land sites, I mean, how are you thinking about infill urban as opposed to more of the first ring suburbs, just given the dynamics that have evolved over COVID? Joseph Russell : Yes, Mike, we're vetting both. We're not seeing really any material degradation in urban versus suburban demand factors. So the team is out hunting for sites that have the right dynamics from a competitive standpoint, meaning finding land sites that were much more benefited by having less competition.  The amount of demographic analysis that we do, overall ability to predict and see good demand factors over time based on any particular new development. So it hasn't really turned anything, I would call, from a segmentation standpoint that we would be hesitant to go into urban versus suburban or prioritize 1 over the other. Frankly, we have a good and healthy mix of both as it stands. And based on -- even in this environment, the kind of trends and the overall demand factors, we're confident that both types of environments are very good for our business, so long as we understand the ultimate dynamics that go right down to that specific trade area. We've got great data. We've got the ability to vet those sites very quickly. And as I mentioned, we're seeing some pretty interesting opportunities around land sites with less competition. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back to Ryan Burke for additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Angela, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We very much look forward to seeing you virtually again on Monday at the Investor Day. Have a good weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties.

We do ask that you initially limit yourself to 2 questions. Of course, after two, if you have further questions, please feel free to jump back in the queue. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Tom and I will walk you through some highlights from Q2, as well as our perspective on the second half of the year. And then we will open up the call for questions. I'd like to start by stating the obvious business is excellent. Moving rates are up 27% from where they were in 2019 and there is little evidence that pricing strength is abating. A meaningful wave of new first time customers are using storage based on a combination of traditional and non-traditional reasons. In 2021, we have welcomed nearly 700,000 new customers to our platform many having never used Self Storage before. Demand has been strong for several quarters, with upward pressure tied to vibrant home sales, up 34% year-over-year. In addition, a hybrid work home environment is being planned by 68% of companies according to a recent Deloitte survey. This certainly gives us confidence that overall adoption of Self Storage will continue to grow, and is looked upon favorably by consumers and businesses as a cost efficient alternative to storing goods in residential or commercial space. I'd like to step back for a moment and reflect on our May 3 investor day. The Public Storage leadership team took you behind the orange door and outlined several strategic initiatives. I am pleased to say many of these strategies are taking hold in 2021 and I'd like to highlight three areas that were particularly evident in our Q2 results. First, organic growth powered by innovation. Our multi-year and continued investment in technology has allowed us to give customers what they want and efficient and more consistent leasing experience with the support of a knowledgeable and helpful property manager when needed. Our industry leading online e-rental platform opened up an entirely new channel for customers to rent a Self Storage unit and adoption has been impressive. Nearly 50% of our customers now select this option. It's fast, intuitive, and simple. What's even better, the quality of the customers using this option has been excellent and our employees have embraced it as well. We are already seeing the impact this new channel will have on labor utilization, while improving customer satisfaction. This has clearly been a win-win for customers and our operations team. In 2021, we also launched the PS Storage app giving customers a new tool to access their property via smartphone along with the ability to manage their account, including automatic payment of rent. Second, our four factor growth platform; Public Storage is uniquely positioned to drive growth through acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and third party management. All areas took steps forward in Q2. Acquisition volume is robust. Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract on nearly $3 billion of assets. The $1.8 billion easy storage portfolio closed 90 days ago, and the integration and performance of those assets has exceeded expectations. Our development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow by $150 million this quarter as we are seeing good opportunities to expand the largest development program in the industry. And third party management is growing with assets under management to 131 properties along with a deepening pipeline of assets under review. Our goal is to reach 500 assets by 2025. Overall, our non-same-store assets at a $0.20 of FFO this quarter, with NOI of 138% driven by improving yields on both development, redevelopment and acquisitions. This 34 million square foot base of assets is now 86% occupied compared to the same-store portfolio had 96.5% with strong momentum to drive additional shareholder value. And third, the utilization of our exceptional balance sheet. This quarter we funded 2.3 billion in transactions through bond issuances driving down are blended cost of leverage to 3.1%. Public Storage has the longest duration balance sheet in the _ industry, with one of the lowest cost profiles with room to fund significant additional growth. Overall, we remain optimistic about the core drivers in our business along with the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand. Our industry leading ownership position and core national markets, all led by a talented and committed team of professionals in every part of our business. Now, I will hand the call over to Tom. Thomas Boyle : Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the second quarter driven by both strong demand from customers and execution from the team. Our same store revenue increased 10.8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. That performance represented the sequential improvement and growth of 7.4% from the first quarter driven by rate. Two factors led to the acceleration in realize rate per foot. First, about half came from strong demand and limited inventory which allowed us to achieve moving rates that were up 48% versus 2020. And as Joe mentioned 27% versus pre-pandemic 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also made up about half of the improvement, comparing against the period when we did not send increases at the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Now onto expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, we discussed at our investor day, the operating model transformation underway. About half of the year-over-year decline in payroll expense was attributable to those initiatives that use technology and roll specialization to drive improvements in customer experience, employee experience, and our expense levels. And the other half of the payroll decline is comparing against the onset of the pandemic last year when we put in place a program that we call the PS Cares program to provide additional support to our operations team including a $3 per hour incentive for property managers. On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate ratably through the year, leading to an approximately $0.05 benefit in each of the first three quarters of the year and reversing to a $0.15 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expense profile in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, as Joe mentioned, the lease up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities was also a standout in the quarter adding 35 million in NOI or $0.20 of FFO. As we sit here today at the peak of the leasing season, customer demand remains robust and business is good. So let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint or 4.8%. Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same store revenue to grow from 7% to 8.5% in 2021. That outlook implies a faster rate of growth in the second half compared to our 7.1% growth in the first half. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about 300 basis points from peak now to trough at the end of the year. This would generally reflect a return to typical seasonality of the business, albeit at higher occupancies than historically achieved. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth in the second quarter which will be the driver of performance in the second half. We also expect continued strong expense control throughout 2021. Our expectations are for 0% to 1% same-store expense growth. And we also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions in the strong lease up of our own stabilized facilities. The balance sheet, as Joe mentioned, is poised for incremental activity in the second half of this year. To wrap up, business is good in the strategies we discussed at our investor day in May are evident in this quarter. With that I'll turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America. Jeffrey Spector : Great, good afternoon. My first question, I guess I'm trying to tie a couple of the comments you made. I think, Joe I know that you've been positive of course in the sector, but your opening remarks about the vibrant hope sales, hybrid work environment steadiness and overall adoption of the business to continue verse the guidance of occupancy dropping through in your bits and in the slower months ahead. How do we tie those two comments together? Joseph Russell : Yes Jeff. The business itself is, as we noted quite strong. We're seeing additive momentum from different drivers and traditional drivers as I mentioned. The thing that's questionable, but could play through is a reversion to some degree of what we would say normal seasonality and some of the metrics that we've seen historically which have gone into our guidance for the second half of the year. Now clearly if the momentum that we've seen for the last several quarters continues to be as strong as it has that could soften or not be as typical as what we see from a seasonality standpoint. But that's to be determined. We were very pleased by the continued level of demand that we're seeing from customers and our pricing abilities based on that demand clearly across all markets. To some degree, we're seeing a little bit of shifting in markets that may not have quite as pronounced in migration or overall movement but still on a relative basis very healthy demand. Jeffrey Spector : Thank you. And then my follow up question is again, on the opening remarks. Joe, you commented on adaption of business customers. And I guess, can you talk about that a little bit more? Are you starting any new initiatives to grab that customer? I'm sorry, I'm not as aware of that initiative at PSA. Is something changing here to try to do more with that business customer. Joseph Russell : So Jeff, we've always had a blended focus on both consumers and business customers. Property to property we will see a varying degree of demand that comes from either cohort. Our business customers, too, are very active as you can imagine, with the economy starting to percolate in many different ways. Many businesses are coming back to properties that may have not used the space one or two years ago with different economic drivers. But with the resurgence and the opening up of many economies, we're just seeing, again, an elevated level of both consumer and business activity. Our spaces cater to both. We have good activity and we continue to cater to each type of customer whether again, it's a consumer or a business. Jeffrey Spector : Okay, sorry, if I could just clarify. So I knew that I'm sorry, I should have been more clear like you are not, you don't have initiatives, like one of your peers has micro fulfillment initiatives. You're not. Are you moving in that direction? Joseph Russell : Well, I'm not speaking to that I'm speaking more to the holistic activity levels we're seeing from both types of customers. Both types of customer demand has been strong, and we continue to see good activity. And as I mentioned, in some cases, depending on the location of a property, you might have a higher degree of business oriented customers compared to another, but very good activity from both types of customer base. Jeffrey Spector : Okay, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Joseph Russell : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the rate commentary about half of the increase you said came from rate increases to existing customers. I'm sorry, same store revenue, sorry. And that was helped out by the easy comps with no real bumps being passed through the customers last year due to COVID. So how should we think about that, I guess in the second half of the year? At what point where I guess, rate bumps reinstituted last year, if you could remind us and does that mean that rate growth then decelerates? Is that easy comp goes away or not necessarily, because you're still having strong kind of equals to new customers you sit here nearly 30% of 2019 levels. So if you could just help us think about those two components relative to your experience this year, and how that plays out in the second half? Joseph Russell : Yes that's a good question Juan. So last year, we did send those increases that we didn't send in the second quarter. We sent them in the third quarter. But I wouldn't highlight that as a headwind in the second half of this year. And the primary reason is, it is driven by the fact that the match magnitude of the increases that we can send this year are more elevated versus previous year. And that goes back to really two factors, one moving rents being up as significantly as they are, which gives us pricing power with existing tenants as well. And then secondly, last year, we were under pricing regulations in many, many of our markets. With this year, the majority of those having been expired. So those are both tailwinds to existing tenant rate magnitude as we move to the second half. So we don't anticipate a big give back on existing tenants in the third quarter. Juan Sanabria : And just on the occupancy piece of the same store revenue guide, the 300 bips that you're assuming comes off of I'm assuming the 630 number in sequential deceleration. Could you just give us a sense of how that compares to the historical trend? Is that more or less than your experiences in the past? Thomas Boyle : Yes. Juan it's right in the ballpark of the historical and generally speaking, actually, the middle of July is our peak occupancy. We actually had occupancy of north of 97%, in the middle of July. So there's a little bit of incremental peeks there to be had from June 30 numbers, but overall, generally in line. The real story in the second half is you highlighted this rate, though, and I think we can talk about occupancy a little bit here or there. But the driver will be how can we keep the pricing strength in play through the second half, both for new customers and existing customers, and that will drive performance more meaningfully through the second half? Juan Sanabria : Just to clarify, you said typically, your occupancy peaks mid July, but that hasn't necessarily come off this year. That's pretty sticky, at least to date to early August. Joseph Russell : No it has started to come off a little bit. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Joseph Russell : Very modestly. I mean, we're still at the peak of the season here. Juan Sanabria : Got you. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from a line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess first on just kind of the acquisition pipeline, you guys have obviously been extremely busy this year. I'm just curious what the kind of the forward pipeline looks like. And how are kind of pricing expectations changing for sellers today just given the amount of capital kind of chasing deals? Joseph Russell : Sure, Steve. No question. As I noted, yes, we've been busy. We expect to continue to be busy. There is a fair amount of product that's in the market. If you step back and think about how much new products been delivered to the sector over the last four or five years with peak deliveries hitting in 2019 plus or minus 500 new assets being delivered to the market in 2019. And then tapering down a bit 10% to 15% in 2020. And again, another similar tapering down this year. But again, you take that whole pool of assets, year-by-year that was has been ranging over the last, say, five or six years, from 300 to 500 properties per year. There is a fair amount of very attractive, good quality assets that we've been very pleased to go out and capture at what we feel are good values, many of which has been asset quality that we build to as well. So from a value standpoint, and a capital allocation standpoint, we've been very pleased with the pool of candidates that we've been able to acquire. Much of this has also been predicated on some of the unique tools that we have some of which we talked about in our investor day relative to the amount of data that we have market to market that guides us to the targeted parts of markets or new markets that we're entering that may be underserved from a storage standpoint. So that too is a different way in which that we're underwriting and choosing to acquire assets. Valuations are competitive. There is no doubt about it. As to your point, we were seeing a fair amount of capital is still anxious to get into Self Storage. One of the ways that we've been able to maneuver around that is buying assets that are not as stabilized. More stabilized assets can typically attract far greater levels of competition, tighter yields. If on average, you look at the pool of assets that we bought this year outside of easy storage average occupancies plus or minus 50% to 60%. And those have been great assets for us to put right into our platform, lease them up, see good revenue growth and very good returns by virtue of that. So going forward, there is continued activity and many sellers are looking at this environments a good time to bring product to market whether it's on a one off basis, or there is a few larger portfolios likely to hit in the second half of 2021. Our capital is well primed. As I mentioned, we've been able to optimize the cost and efficiency of our own leverage. And we see very good opportunities to continue to allocate capital and we're continuing to underwrite a fair amount of assets. Steve Sakwa : You sort of touched on capital structure, which kind of leads to my second question. You guys have clearly been willing to deploy leverage and take up and use the balance sheet capacity as pricing is rising and deals are offering lower yields. I mean, how are you sort of balancing the use of the balance sheet today against lower returns and maybe that means more development? But how are you sort of weighing the point of capital and using the balance sheet with rising pricing? Thomas Boyle : Yes. well, maybe comment on a few of your questions embedded there. One, we do view development as continued good allocation of capital. Joe mentioned that the pipeline increased by about 150 million this quarter and we obviously outline in the investor day in May, plans to increase it a good bit further from there. In addition to that, though, we are finding good deals that will meet not just a marginal debt cost of capital, but ultimately our overall cost of capital and provide good returns based on our ability to take properties as Joe mentioned, lease them up and earn a good return to stabilization and then rent growth from there. So overall we're still finding good high quality deals that will exceed our cost of capital across the board and we have the balance sheet flexibility to use attractively priced unsecured debt to fund that. Steve Sakwa : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Hey guys thanks a lot for taking my question. Occupancies elevated that 97% average for the quarter. Obviously, the math suggests that some are above the average some are below. So can you help frame how much your same store pool is, like 98% - 99% occupied or completely below? How are you operating the stores differently than those where there's more upside? And then as we think forward should we expect them all to experience seasonality the same or do you anticipate some differences between them? Thanks. Joseph Russell : Sure. So maybe looking at market by market performance, there's clear differentiation in the market dynamics across the country. We do have many markets, if you look in the supplemental, that highlight 96% to 98% occupancies, that are really strong versus historical. And that's really being driven by the ability of us to attract new customers, but also the fact that our existing tenants are performing quite well. And that's something we spent a lot of time talking about last year that has persisted into 2021. So it's allowed occupancies to creep higher. But at this point, with 97% occupancy or even falling modestly from there, it's about driving rate. And as I mentioned, that was really the story in the second quarter and through the second half, versus trying to drive incremental occupancy here. We're trying to balance that occupancy versus inventory but clearly looking to drive rate. In terms of strength within the markets there are some standouts. If you look at what's going on, for instance, in the state of Florida, we have particular strengths there. Population growth housing activity, as Joe discussed, we're seeing really strong activity there. And really across the economy there. We view that as encouraging as we think about those strong procyclical demand drivers driving our business, which is a counter to last year when we did see some more counter cyclical drivers that were driving the business at this point in time. So we're encouraged by that and we will see some variation there by market. In terms of your question on occupancy which markets will fall which, which will stay there's definitely trends in different markets that will influence that, for instance, our colder markets tend to see a bigger seasonal swing and occupancy than our warmer markets. But it'll vary. Thomas Boyle : Yes, and Michael, just to add our west coast markets from Seattle, all the way down to San Diego are dealing with extremely high occupancy levels. The amount of new supply coming in those markets for the most part is limited. But on the other side of the barbell which is really tight right now, Houston, which has been a poster child for lower occupancy, high supply, I mean, Houston is at 95%. That speaks to what Tom just talked about which is another added driver that we're seeing in different parts of the country primarily Texas and the southeast is amplified levels of activity because of migration and we're even looking for signals can some of that taper down, and it's not at all and even as many of those markets actually returned to some level of normal, again, activity from opening up businesses, etc, we really see no degradation in demand and/or occupancy levels. So we continue to fill up even higher supply markets has been quite pronounced and we're pleased to see that and we're continuing to look for any signals if there's any reversion. But as we speak, that band a very tight occupancy market to market is quite strong. Michael Goldsmith : That's helpful. And can you talk about the performance of the easy storage portfolio, since you acquired it? they at an 86% occupancy rate, and are you or can you share where it is now maybe talk about how some of the lease up properties within it are performing? And then if you can break out kind of how much of any growth is reflective of the market versus what you've been able to do with it, and what sort of initiative you've got been able to put in to generate additional growth? Thanks. Joseph Russell : Sure. I mentioned we're 90 days into the ownership of that portfolio. So we had about 115 properties in the metro D.C. area and with the easy portfolio now we're north of 160. So very good activity from elevated occupancy growth. The portfolio today is at about 94% occupied. If you remember, one of the things that we had talked about is, the prior owner was very good operator, but also didn't have some of the sophisticated tools that we've been able to apply into that portfolio in relation to existing cuts, customer tactics or strategies. We're starting to deploy those, seeing a very good level of transition and integration, we inherited about 43,000 customers. We're seeing good continued tenancy, good integration with our own existing portfolio and we've just begun the expansion process about 10% expansions possible by again magnifying in some cases the size of properties in certain markets that had already been pre-entitled. So that too is taking place. the properties for the most part, gone through the first wave of rebranding. They look great in orange and we've also seen a very good integration from hiring a number of very strong property managers and district managers that have come into our portfolio as well. So overall, very pleased with what we've seen. And we, as I mentioned, have a very strong presence in that market far beyond any other operator and the quality of these assets is very additive to what we've continued to do and see from a benefit standpoint in the Washington metro market. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little more about the third party management platform and the path to get to 500 by I think year end 24 you said. Is that mostly driven by new properties that are on deck to come online? Or are you also adding just converting independent properties? Or maybe from other brands in the space? Joseph Russell : Yes. Smedes the goal it's 2025. So we're definitely on the path to continue driving the size of that program. To your point, it is a process where there is a high level of activity tied to new development. I mentioned that our backlog continues to grow and we've seen a number of one off developers and some with multiple properties come to our platform that are in various stages of development. It's a different lens, clearly that points to the fact that the development, part of our industries, still active. And we're seeing the opportunity to grow the platform through that. Now having said that we are also finding some good opportunities to bring existing assets into the program as well. Many of the owners have started off with say one or two assets and are now starting to give us multiple assets. So that's I think indicative of the performance that we continue to show to the owners that have come into the platform and the benefit they're seeing by being within the public storage brand. The other thing I pointed out is we've now actually acquired 10 assets that have come into the program as well. So it's another avenue or channel for us to get closer to many owners who actually are coming back to us and saying would we have interest in actually acquiring these assets. So there's multiple drivers that we're going to continue to focus on as we build the program. We've got a team that's focused nationally. The assets that we've added, and having our backlog are literally widespread across the 39 states that we operate in. So we're pleased by that as well, and look forward to continue to grow the program. Smedes Rose : Great. Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you last, on your last call, you talked a little bit about the supply outlook with I think 2021, you're looking for kind of a 10% to 15% leg down in the pace of deliveries relative to 20. It just, I, just over the past few months, have you seen any change in that or kind of any updated sort of thoughts on what the supply picture might look like going forward? Joseph Russell : Yes. I mean the added color give you and you are right, that's the view that we've had, looking at the amount of volume that is likely to come into 2021. One thing that we're seeing is low approval processes at multiple cities. And that coupled with the fact that component costs are elevated, whether it's steel, labor, concrete, etc. So that's, I think stalling some of the development starts that might have been predicted either for 2021 and going into 2022. So we're keeping a close eye on it. We're clearly very deep into the development cycle in our own portfolio and understand and see the various headwinds that are playing through right now. Fortunately, we've got different ways to combat some of the cost pressures that are coming through that one off developer might not have the advantage to do so whether it's bulk buying or knowing and understanding how to pre-bid certain assets or components of assets. But with that we're likely to see, again, that laid down you talk to you and 2021. 2022, I would be surprised if it accelerates. It could take either a moderate step down or could be flatline based on the amount of activity that we're seeing in 2021 and then what's more unclear is what could happen in 2023 and beyond. So we'll see. Smedes Rose :  Okay. fine. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. So you already touched on some of this. But when you look at the market by market performance, obviously you're proposing well, but some markets it seems to revenues up a lot more than LA, San Francisco or New York. Is it really just some markets are positive net migration market and that's driving the relative performance? Or are there other elements that you're noticing in between these markets? Joseph Russell : I'd say overall Ki Bin no question we're seeing broad based strength. I mean, you look at all of our markets in the second quarter really strong growth and acceleration from the first quarter. I think what you're highlighting is there is some variation, which is something we see with a strong nationally diversified portfolio. What I highlighted earlier was a shift that I think I'll reiterate because we view it as pretty meaningfully internally where last year at this time, some of our absolute strongest markets we are experiencing some what I would consider a pandemic related dislocation and you can put the New York's or San Francisco's into that bucket and so they weren't our strongest markets. And you fast forward a year and our strongest markets now, as Joe and I mentioned earlier on the call Florida, Texas, Sunbelt markets, as well as some others, Chicago I would put in there as well. But there is some clear relationship between some of the macro drivers in Florida and Texas and Sunbelt markets for instance, that are driving demand. Housing clearly being one of them population inflows. And we're seeing real strength to highlight one market as an example, Miami which is our fifth largest market. We have about 90 stores, there in the same-store pool. Moving rents up 43% versus 2019. So a big market being fueled by macro drivers and real strength. In terms of what we're seeing in some of the bigger coastal markets we're seeing good demand there and still really strong occupancies and the ability to push rate. Year-over-year comps, frankly, are tougher in those markets right now as we sit compared to say, Miami, for instance. But if you look at performance versus 2019, still quite good. And we were encouraged by the demand trends there. I mean, what we're seeing in Los Angeles is really strong. North of 98% occupancy here in Los Angeles and strong demand drivers across the board. So generally pretty encouraged. But there are some factors that are causing some differentiation and I would add that we're going to continue to see new supply come into some of these markets and impact performance from here just like we have over the last five years. Ki Bin Kim : Got it. And the second question, it's been a little bit over a year now since COVID. Are you noticing any difference in the lifetime value of a customer that customers that have moved in over the past year or length of stay versus what a typical customer profile would look like pre-COVID. Joseph Russell : We spent a good bit of time talking about this through last year. We did see a shift towards longer length of stay and really strong existing tenant performance through the year last year. That's persisted. So tenants that were in house or moved in last year have continued perform really-really well and ahead of pre-pandemic expectations. Customers that have moved in this year have behaved more like our typical storage customers from 2019 for instance. Still performing really well. But not at that market improvement that we saw last year. The one thing I'd highlight from a lifetime value is clearly the rate portion of the equation. So if we're seeing good length of stays, and significantly higher rates that clearly leads to higher lifetime values. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, a couple quick questions. Congrats on the quarter. The first is just talk about potential restrictions in the portfolio on rent increases. Is there a way to sort of quantify that the magnitude of that is at 5% or the 10%? just big ballpark numbers. And was curious as well what if there's still any sort of restrictions or on the late charges and administrative fees? Is there still some, are you guys back to normal? Or is it still sort of hampered? Thanks. Joseph Russell : Sure. So the first question around rent regulations. For the most part those have expired and there was a big push through the first half of this year in many local governments to move past those state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And so for the most part they're no longer in place. the one I would highlight that is meaningful for us is the pricing restrictions from the state of emergency tied to wildfires here in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is our number one market with about 15% of our revenue and we continue to be a constraint here on rental activity. So that's when I highlight. The others have largely expired. There are a few here and there. That fact is a tailwind as we move to the second half where last year we were restricted on rent in many-many markets across the country. But it will take time to move existing tenants back up to where they would have otherwise been. And then your second question was on late fees. We did see some local jurisdictions put those in place. Some of the restrictions as it relates to our delinquent tenant processes remain in place but similar to rent regulations. Those are expiring and governments are looking to get back to regular business. Nothing material, I'd highlight there from a financial impact in the quarter. And I would I Ki Bin we've talked about this throughout last year fees, Ron, sorry, the fees were a big drag last year and we saw it now for the first time we've lapped that fee drag and don't anticipate that to continue to be a negative driver as we move through the second half. So that was a big shift in the second quarter. Ronald Kamdem : Got it. Helpful. And the second question was just going to be just the taking in all the expenses a little bit. Obviously, the marketing makes a lot of sense, but can you just provide a little bit more color on you know whether it's the on-site property manager payroll, sort of the 34% decline there? What's driving that? Is that e-rentals? Is it less man hours? Just a little bit more color on that big drop? Joseph Russell : Sure Ron. It's a number of things that you just spoke to it points to the variety of things that we're doing from the infusion and the digitization of the business. We have a lot of analytics that help us look to the optimized level of labor. e-rental as I mentioned is having a pronounced effect if you kind of step back and think about the traditional operating model for the entire self storage industry. Historically it's always been centered on an interaction necessary at the counter with a property manager and in our case if 50% or so of our customers are choosing to do this electronically and self-directed that typical 30 to 45 minute transaction process that would happen at a counter is no longer necessary for again about half the customers that are at their own election choosing that option. So it's giving us the opportunity to retool and re-prioritize levels of labor utilization while also not preserving but actually enhancing customer satisfaction. So as I mentioned we think that that's working well both from a customer's perspective and from an operations perspective. We continue to look at a variety of different tools through the amount of data that we collect at properties relative to activity levels whether it's time of the week, time of the month and again using those again analytics to put people in the right places at the right times. So good things to come from that and we're continuing to see different levels of optimization as this again plays out from a customer standpoint in a much more optimized way. Ronald Kamdem : Got it. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. I'm curious what do you see as the longer term margin on the third party management business and it what sort of property count do you have to scale up to hit that? Joseph Russell : Sure. So that margin will vary based on geographic concentration and the like but there is certainly a path for us to get that margin up to 25% - 30%. I think at this point one of the drags to that margin as we look at our own performance is the fact that many of the properties that we've taken to manage are in lease up and that's going to continue as we look to grow this business. So I would anticipate that our margins are a good bit below that for the next several years as we look to increase the size and scope and in particular with properties and lease up. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. that was it. Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. I will now hand the call over to Mr. Burke for any closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to interacting through the third quarter and enjoy the rest of your summers.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the phone will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Emma. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm here with Joe Russell, CEO; Tom Boyle, CFO; and Mike McGowan, Senior Vice President of Acquisitions. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, November 2nd, 2021, and we assume no obligation to update or revise or supplement statements become untrue because of subsequent events.  A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports, and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, PublicStorage.com. As usual, we do ask that you keep yourself limited to two questions to begin with. Of course, if you have more, feel free to jump back in queue with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin with the obvious. Overall, business is excellent. I do want to thank the entire team at Public Storage for their efforts. Our team members from our properties, to the corporate office and back, are focused on driving this level of performance. Across our industry and consistently throughout our markets, more customers than ever before have been drawn to the benefits of using self-storage. We have often characterized additive demand coming from life events, which we've referred to as the 4 Ds; divorce, death, dislocation and disasters. For the last several quarters a 5th D has emerged; Decluttering. Customers need more space at home due to the shifts in working and living environments across all markets. Unfortunately, the customers that have come to us during the pandemic are now behaving more like traditional customers, meaning they are staying in place as they have come to appreciate the convenience and cost benefit of using cell storage, particularly as residential and commercial spaces become more expensive. With that said, demand remains historically strong. In the third quarter, our revenue, NOI, and cash flow per share foot, reached record levels once again. As we wrap up 2021, the outlook for 2022 and beyond is favorable as well. The utilization rate of self-storage continues to climb, as it has for decades, which is now at 11% of the US population. Millennials and Gen Zs, two big user groups, are aging into our core customer life-stage, driven once again, by the 5Ds. And Public Storage is leading the self-storage industry's transformation, towards a customer experience, that provides digital, as well as traditional options, across the entire customer journey. We have a deep-seated commitment to listen to what our customers want and they are giving us vibrant input that directs our priorities. This has led to some exciting changes in our customer offerings. One example we have spoken to is our industry-leading e-rental platform.  Today, nearly 50% of our customers are renting with us through the e-rental online lease. Year-to-date, nearly 500,000 customers have chosen e-rental to secure a unit. It's fast, intuitive, and self-directed, taking just a few minutes to complete a rental. An option many customers have been anxious to use. And the quality of this customer has been impressive. In early 2021, we also introduced the PS app, which nearly 1 million customers have now downloaded, allowing easy tools to manage your accounts and navigate our properties digitally and hands free. These are two great examples of how our investment in technology is transforming our operating model.  And it's a win-win for both customers and our operating efficiencies. Daily headlines across multiple industries, however, remind us there are challenging consequences impacting the economy in terms of labor pressure, and self-storage is not immune. We are actively investing in our team through increased wages and new, more specialized positions that are providing even greater upward mobility for our skilled property teammates. On the leadership front, we have also strengthened our ranks, and announced yesterday that David Lee has joined Public Storage as Chief Operating Officer. David previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations for the UPS Store. With responsibility for more than 5,200 retail locations the in the U.S. and Canada, we are excited to have him on board. Now to another area, I'm pleased to share with you our external growth initiatives. Our 4-factor external growth platform is centered on acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and third-party management. All areas are seeing strong growth. Starting with acquisitions, in 2021, the self-storage industry will likely see approximately $18 billion or more of assets trade. This is a tremendous amount of volume and opportunity. Owners have been motivated to bring assets to market, to monetize their investments, while some also plan for potential tax changes. Year-to-date, we have acquired or under contract on $5.1 billion of acquisitions, or about 30% of the industry volume this year.  This has come -- this is comprised of 233 properties across 21.1 million square feet with average occupancy of 56%, which is providing a significant embedded growth opportunity once we place these assets onto the Public Storage Platform. The transaction spans a wide spectrum of geographies, portfolios, and one-off purchases, with both market and off-market deals. We continue to be looked at as a preferred buyer based on our knowledge, transaction efficiency, and ability to easily fund transactions. Of note, 65% of this quarter's volume is tied to the All-Storage Portfolio, which we are acquiring for $1.5 billion. All Storage is a high-quality Portfolio of 56 properties primarily located in Dallas, Fort Worth.  Dallas, Fort Worth has been one of the best storage -- cell storage markets over the past 15 years. With population growth nearly 2 times that of the national average. Our own Portfolio in Dallas, Fort Worth, produced annual NOI growth of a 150 Basis points higher, than our national average. The All-Storage properties also give us additional exposure to new, higher-growth submarkets, particularly in and around Fort Worth. Many of the properties were recently developed resulting in the current 75% occupancy level which provides significant upside as we move them onto our industry-leading platform. The transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and accretion will accelerate through to stabilization at nearly 6% direct NOI yield.  And combined with owned and other assets under contract, we are expanding our already significant platform in this vibrant market to approximately 200 assets, or by 64%. The remaining 35%, or $1.1 billion of the acquisitions closed or under contract will provide significant growth as well. These assets are geographically diversified across the country, comprised of single acquisitions, to smaller portfolios, ranging in size from $40 million to $200 million dollars totaling 3.9 million square feet, with average occupancy of 50% at a $179 per square foot. Now to development and redevelopment, where our pipeline has grown by $70 million to $731 million this quarter.  We're seeing good opportunity to build new properties from the ground up in addition to expanding our existing assets. Nationally, our development team is underwriting well-located land sites as we continue to leverage our expertise, as the largest developer in the self-storage industry. This quarter, we also added 28 properties to our third-party management platform, increasing properties under management to 145. We plan to reach 500 assets by 2025. Of note, we have also acquired 14 assets from our third-party management platform as well. In summary, since the beginning of 2019, we have expanded our portfolio square footage by 22% with a total investment of approximately $7 billion, equaling 36 million square feet, for an average of $193 per square foot, which has clearly produced strong growth and value creation that we expect will continue. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Boyle : Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the third quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 14% compared to the third quarter of 2020. That performance represented a sequential improvement in growth of 3.2% from the second quarter, driven by rate. 2 factors led to the acceleration in realized rent per foot. 1. Strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 24% versus 2020, at 33% versus 2019, 2. Existing tenant rate increases contributed, comparing to a period in 2020 and we were significantly impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets. Now on to expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment once again.  Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing, and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, as Joe discussed, on October 1st, we increased Property Manager wages, which will lead to higher expenses going forward, but will be partially offset by efficiencies in labor hours tied to the operating model transformation we discussed at our Investor Day in May. On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate [indiscernible] through the year, leading to an approximately $0.13 benefit year-to-date and reversing to a $0.13 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expenses in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter.  In addition to the same-store, the lease up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities, was also a standout in the quarter, adding $53 million in NOI in the quarter, or $0.30 in FFO. As we sit here today, coming off the peak part of the leasing season, existing customer behavior is solid, with move-outs down year-over-year in the quarter, and new customer demand remaining robust. So with that let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint, or 4.5%.  Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same-store revenue, to grow from 9.5% to 10.5% in 2021, that outlook implies a modest deceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter, against very tough comps. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about a 150 basis points to the end of the year. That would land occupancy at the healthy 2020 levels at the end of the year. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth where we continue to see strength. Our expectations are for 0 to 0.5% same-store expense growth.  As a reminder, that implies an increase of circa 30% in the fourth quarter driven by the property tax timing I discussed. We also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions and strong lease up of our own stabilized facilities. Now, on the balance sheet, we have one of the industry's leading balance sheet s set up well to finance the transaction volumes we've seen this year. We plan on funding the all-storage acquisitions with unsecured debt, and we remain poised to grow with capacity to fund the continued activity that Joe has discussed. With that, turn it back to you, Joe. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Tom. We are optimistic about our business and for good reason. As always, the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand, a high quality, and well-located portfolio, the industry-leading operating platform, and most important of all, our people, have us well-positioned for sustainable growth and value creation. Now we'll open the call up for questions. Operator : At this time, if you would like to ask a question, [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Good afternoon. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'm not sure if there's -- if we're allowed 2 questions, so I guess my first would be on the new hire, David Lee. Very interesting, I guess, if Joe you can provide a little bit more details on David 's role and what you see him bringing to Public Storage, please. Joseph Russell : Sure Jeff. First, we're excited about David joining the executive leadership team. We've built over a number of decades now, a great operations team. Today, the teams comprise of over 5,000 and over of our associates, who are committed to deliver exceptional customer service while clearly adapting to the many changes that we've been talking about. So David 's joining us at an exciting time. His role will be to continue leading what we call the customer journey, where we're unlocking and delivering new tools to our teams and offering different channels and experiences right at the front lines for our customers.  And with that, his engagement with the team as a whole will be very important as we move the entire team forward through a very dynamic time not only for the Company, but for the industry. Clearly, his skills were attractive, based on its 20 years or so with the UPS organization. The UPS Store platform more particularly, so we're very excited about his fresh perspective, as we continue the various changes to our overall operating model. And definitely look forward to the contributions he bit -- brings to the entire management team. Jeffrey Spector : Great. That sounds great. And hopefully if I have a second, Joe, I always consider you to be conservative with your comments, so it's encouraging to hear the outlook for '22 and beyond looks favorable. We're getting a lot of questions on supply in '23, I guess. Can you elaborate? Not looking for guidance, but now what makes you feel comfortable to make that statement and then, I guess, in particular, supply? Joseph Russell : Yeah, Jeff. The thing that has been a nice window for us over the last year to 2, is the reduction in national deliveries of new storage products. We've talked about that for some time, where this year there's likely to be about $3.5 billion or so of new deliveries, put it on the markets nationally, compared to the peak that we saw in 2019 of about $5 billion. We're likely to see that number trend down again in 2022, particularly with some of the hurdles that are out there from a development standpoint that we clearly see day-in and day-out, that includes the time it takes to get a property entitled, many of the cities are clearly understaffed and we're seeing longer processes actually to get something as simple as a permit or a use or a occupancy use for -- meant for a property come through, to more commanding issues that we're seeing even from the cost and availability of components of construction and then labor itself.  So there's some different and I would say commanding issues that any developer today has to go through to operate in this kind of an environment. So that's likely to produce, again, this down-drop draft that we're predicting for 2022. Now, having said all that, our industry has, you well know, is very fragmented. The development industry as a whole tied to self-storage is too very fragmented and it's hard to predict what level of activity might resurface in different markets based on, frankly, the continued very strong performance of the sector. So we're keeping a very close eye on that. As we've talked about, we've got a deep team across the entire national set of opportunities that we're working on. And we're also seeing activity that's coming through our third-party management platform Joseph Russell : as well, that is tied to future development. So it will be with us. The question is, how much more momentum comes out of the environment we're dealing with as we speak? Which is one of the long-term attributes of cell storage. It's great business. So we'll see and monitor the impact that's likely to have but we feel at this point we continue to have a very good run rate to go out and capture good land sites with the deep development team and the knowledge we've got across all of our markets. Jeffrey Spector : Okay, thank you. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just -- I wanted to ask a little bit more about the decision to load up more in Dallas. And maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the process, how competitive it was to get this portfolio. And then I -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I guess I think of Dallas as a fairly low barrier to entry market and I'm just wondering are there any risks to meeting these stabilized yields that you're targeting? Joseph Russell : Yes, sure. Smedes. First off, I mean, we have a longstanding commitment to Dallas. We've seen, as I mentioned in my opening comments, good growth that's come out of that market. You're right, it has been a market that's been prone to an outside level of development from time-to-time. But frankly, the embedded growth that we see that's tied to a very business-friendly, economy, low cost, including taxes, cost of housing etc., centrally located within the United States, great infrastructure. It's a huge draw for both business and overall population growth. So what came with this portfolio was an opportunity to leapfrog our position, that was already a top position, that market, where we have had approximately 120 existing assets, as well as a dozen or so third-party management properties and leapfrogging it by another 52 to 53 properties. So huge opportunity to grow and actually put additional presence in parts of the Dallas, Fort Worth market, particularly Fort Worth, that we were lighter in. And Fort Worth for instance, like Dallas as a whole or the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, is growing dramatically. So we're really encouraged by that population growth.  It's very strong, good house hold income, and we really like the multiple attributes that we will see and continue to see with our industry-leading position in that particular market. Mike McGowan is with us; I'm going to hand the mic over to him. He can give you a little color on what came through with the process we went through to actually capture the portfolio. Thomas Boyle : Thanks Joe. So it was a competitive process. It was quietly marketed with more or less a few select people that could take down a transaction of this size. In reference to your size -- your question about the location the new supply coming in, this developer really did a great job of putting a footprint of 50 properties in markets that were so far ahead of his time, out in areas that are having high barriers for new storage to come in. He built large properties in those marketplaces, kept a lot of competitors out at the same time. And really for us, we're starting to see the same type of issues with zoning, of getting new storage in a lot of these newer areas, in these high-growth areas, which are the better areas of the Dallas, Fort Worth market. So for us, it puts us in a great position to be in new markets we want to be in, and gives us a very strong presence in all those markets to do it that fills big gaps for us at the same time. Joseph Russell : And one other thing, Smedes, from integration and assimilation standpoint, we have as we did with ezStorage, a great opportunity to bring in the majority of their operations team. We're excited about adding those new members to the Public Storage team there on Dallas, Fort Worth. The opportunity for us to integrate these assets and put them under the Public Storage brand will be very efficient. Clearly, we're very skilled at that coming right off the experience we just had in Washington Metro with ezStorage. So we're very confident that in a very short period of time, we can transfer the 60 plus thousand customers that are coming with this portfolio into our own systems and our own opportunity to drive value based on the way that we're going to be able to run those properties as we do our entire portfolio. Smedes Rose : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Juan Sanabria with BMO. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about on the acquisition side, the yields going in and target stabilized for the third quarter transactions as well as what's on the dock, including All Storage. You talked about -- a little bit about it on a stabilized basis, but curious on the going in yields from a modeling perspective. Thomas Boyle : Sure. This is Tom. As Joe mentioned, a lot of the activity in the third quarter into the fourth quarter is unsterilized activity. And so what -- if you think about average occupancies in the 50% I would have that in your mindset. And then from a yield standpoint, we obviously gave you a sense for all storage, what those yields are. Call it 2.6% on their operating platform in the third quarter, so that gives you a starting point. And I would say across the other properties, probably similar type yields even with a little bit lower occupancy. So I think that gives you a starting point. Clearly, we have confidence in our ability to lease these properties up. One of the things that Joe mentioned earlier around our confidence in our operating platform in Dallas, Fort Worth, similar to Washington, DC.  If you look at our ez transaction from earlier in the year. when we acquired that at 86% occupied, we got it to 94% through the busy season. And really strong growth in a market where we're out of inventory, so to give you a sense, a few of those properties we took over in the 40% occupancies and got them up to 90% by the end of the busy season, which is clearly strong leasing activity. In Dallas, similarly, we're out of inventory. We've successfully leased up our activity that we've built and bought over the last several years, and are poised to take over these All-Storage properties here over the next several months. Joseph Russell : Yeah. Juan, I'd add, as again we've talked to, and Mike and his team have been very focused on for the last year-and-a-half, in particular, a lot of great assets have been built over the last 5 or 6 years. And we've really had the opportunity to capture very high-quality assets, mostly recently built in this cycle. And what we feel are good values, with good opportunities to grow performance. That's why we haven't been shy about taking on any level of un -stabilized occupancy and these assets. As Tom mentioned, we're very confident, particularly in its environment relative to our lease up capabilities, as well as taking on the stabilization in an era where we're seeing some very, very good consumer and business demand, frankly. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then just hoping you could speak to the latest data points, maybe through October, from an occupancy and a rate perspective. You noted the implied guidance for the fourth quarter is at 150 basis point occupancy moderation. Just curious on how we stand to-date on that? Thomas Boyle : Yes. Sure. It's made -- to just give you a sense as to where October ended, the year-over-year gap and occupancy, we were at 1.2% at the end of September. That has fallen a touch to around positive 75 basis point gap at this point. So we are seeing that modest moderation in occupancy as we move into the fourth quarter here, but continued strength on rate. And so we continue to see good Growth there. Some of the markets that we're seeing, the most strength, the Southeast Miami, Atlanta, the Sunbelt in aggregate, continuing to see a greater than 50% move in rate growth at this time of year compared to 2019. So, really strong pricing momentum here despite a modest declines in Year-over-year occupancy. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Thomas Boyle : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Thomas Boyle : Hey, Michael. Are you on mute? Operator : We will go next to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Good morning out there. First question I wanted to circle back to investments for Joe or Tom. With All Storage, now you've disclosed, you're taking up leverage to 4.3 times on a pro forma basis. And there are a couple of other larger scale portfolios, reportedly on the market, and a lot more product besides those portfolios that you discussed. You still have room to take leverage up obviously, you have a lot of access to capital as well. But your dry powder's decreasing a bit if you're looking to stay in that 4 to 5 times range that you discussed at the Investor Day earlier in the year. So I'm curious what the appetite is like for additional larger scale deals, And then we saw that you're issuing $80 million of units for the deals under contract. Should we assume that PSA is open to issuing more equity today as part of the funding plans going forward? Joseph Russell : So, first of all, I'll address the environment holistically, Todd, then Tom can give you a little bit more color around what I would call the tools in our toolkit. But the environment continues to be very vibrant. We're seeing a vast array of different types of sellers coming to market. And we feel well poised with the capacity of our balance sheet to continue to be a very efficient acquirer. And we want to maintain that because we think it's highly advantageous, even in a market like this, where it's quite competitive depending on the type of asset and the location, etc., that might come through. We feel we're very well poised.  Our balance sheet has been and will continue to be a great competitive advantage for us, and we'll continue to, as I mentioned, look at many of the tools in our toolkit. Tom, can give you a little more color on that, but we're very confident we will continue to be able to embrace this environment with a whole range of different opportunities that may come through. Thomas Boyle : Yes, thanks, Joe. And as you mentioned, Todd, we do have strong access to capital with our balance sheet position the way it is. And we're confident in our ability to continue to fund acquisition activity with a broad set of tools. So we spoke about using unsecured debt. And we've used unsecured debt, really over the last several years to fund activity. That doesn't mean that we're not open to other alternatives, including common equity or JV equity as we discussed at our Investor Day, to the extent that volumes are both high-quality, attractive financial return, we would certainly be open, and welcome the opportunity to use a broad variety of tools in the toolkit over time. But for All Storage in particular, we plan to fund it with unsecured debt and we feel good about the leverage level where it is today. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then if I could ask one more, just about the existing customer rent increases. And Tom, when you look at the 14% of revenue growth in the quarter, you talked about there was a small portion that was related to occupancy. When you look at the balance of the revenue growth in the period, how should we think about the contribution between the higher move-in rates that you described and the impact from ECRIs? Thomas Boyle : Yeah that's a good question. So really on a year-to-date basis, we've seen a pretty balanced contribution between the move-in, move-out dynamics on one side, and then the existing tenant rate increases, both contributing meaningfully. I would put them roughly on par with each other in terms of the contribution. I do think going forward, one of the things we disclosed is our move-out activity and the move-out rates. So, move-out rates are starting to catch up with move-in rates. They have not caught up yet, but they're starting to catch up. And that will start to be a headwind on the contribution from the move-in to move-outside. but we will still have existing tenant rent increases as a tailwind from here, given the market rent increases that we've seen across the country. Todd Thomas : Okay. And with the ECRI program would you expect to see that moderate at all as the -- as move out rates catch up a bit there, or you have to -- do you have to just to take your foot off the gas a little bit as that happens on the existing customer rent increases or is that not the case? Thomas Boyle : Well, I would say that existing tenant rent increases is something that's managed very dynamically across the country, and really across the tenant base. And I think that the way to think about that is, one of the benefits of the current environment is higher market rents and that lowers the cost to replace that tenant if they elect to leave. That kind of base continues to be quite sticky, which gives us confidence to continue to send increases out to the tenant base. As we think about where we're going forward, in fact, one of the contributors to higher move-out rates is actually the fact that we're being successful in increasing rental rates on that existing tenant base. So I would say almost the reverse, which is as we're successful on existing tenant rate increases, I'd anticipate that that move-out rate will move higher. Move-out rate meaning the rent that the people are paying, that do a lot to leave us. Todd Thomas : Okay. Great. Thank you. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Todd. Operator : We'll go next to Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Hi there. Maybe one on development. This can definitely be a great opportunity, but one of the hurdles is that ability to continue getting land in attractive areas. Just wondering if you could go through how this process is going now and any difficulties that you're running into to continue it, Joseph Russell : Well that goes right down to the knowledge and the focus you have to have, relative to what's transpiring in any given submarket, so as I've spoken to, we've got a very deep-seated team across the entire portfolio that we operate today. And in markets that we continue to look for additional growth as well. The opportunity to acquire land over the last year-and-a-half or so has been somewhat elevated because we've seen that tapering down of delivery. So not quite as much as a ground-up development momentum, again, coming from a very fragmented set of developers out there. But lands still very competitive.  There's a lot of knowledge you need to have to find and locate the exact right location that's complementary to future growth of the particular asset, the kind of dynamics that come from competition, as well as population growth, etc. A lot of different factors come into the way that we are able to select land sites very differently than most, because of the amount of data that we have day-in and day-out, relative to our presence already across 39 states, and being a top owner in nearly every one of those submarkets. The business though it's very entrepreneurial from an overall self-storage standpoint. So there's competition that can come through. And as I mentioned, in some cases that may become more elevated than we've seen over the last year and a half.  Keeping a very close eye on it, but we feel like we've got very good tools to not only find great land sites to actually execute, even in an environment where it's tough to get either entitlements and/or justify the cost that are tied, particularly from component costs and labor costs that are playing through to actually develop facilities in an environment where we're seeing a high degree of inflation at the moment. Caitlin Burrows : And actually on the inflation point, I was wondering, just given, obviously revenues are up a lot, the business is really strong [Indiscernible] down. Can you go through what impact do you think inflation is having or will have on your business both from a revenue or expense side. Joseph Russell : Well, one thing that's advantageous to self-storage in general, is the fact that we have a month-to-month lease business. So it's a huge opportunity to actually react to the cost pressures that may play through from inflationary pressures. So, that's an advantage -- the product itself affords us to actually monitor and react to any of those inflationary pressures. We're confident that we can maneuver through those pressures, but it's something we have to keep very close to. And that's why we -- in every part of our business, we constantly look for efficiencies and the ways that we can continue to look at operating and running our business as cost effectively as possible. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Thanks. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ki Bin Kim, Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, and good morning out there. So a simple question on same-store revenue. If market rents don't increase in 2022, how much built-in upside is there already in same-store revenue? Thomas Boyle : Looking for 2022 guidance already, Ki Bin? Ki Bin Kim : Not guidance. This is inside the -- below the low point. So even if market rents don't grow, how much is the starting point, do you think? Thomas Boyle : Yeah. Well, I think there's a few things there. One is, we continue to see strength in market rents. And so I understand the question you're suggesting, but I think that we continue to see strong demand for self-storage across the country. But if you look at the markets with the strongest growth, really driven by macroeconomic demographic, and population shifts that we think are poised to continue here, which is helpful. So clearly, there has been a move in market rents higher and existing tenant rate increases have been moving the current tenant base higher alongside that.  Now, over the course of last year, and really the -- through a good portion of this year, and in some markets continuing today, we have had pricing regulations on us because of state of emergencies and the impact of the healthcare environment. And that's definitely been a headwind as it relates to the existing tenant base and moving them. in the same manner that market rents are going. So, I think another way to say that is there is some embedded rate growth that's available to the extent that we will continue to see normalization from a healthcare standpoint, and the state of emergencies continue to expire. The most notable of which is in Los Angeles County not related to pandemic, but related to fire several years ago that we continue to monitor. Ki Bin Kim : And how impact full was that? I guess said another way, how much money was up from the people as it compares to portfolio? Just to get -- just for us to get a sense of how meaningful that could be. Thomas Boyle : Yeah. So one of the things that we've -- that we look at is, what the impact of those pricing restrictions have been on us versus what our models would have otherwise suggested that we send the increases out at. And I ran these numbers for last quarter, so I'll give you precisely what it was for last quarter. I don't have it for this quarter, but through the first part of the year, first-half of the year, it was about a 300 basis point negative impact to same-store revenue growth in the first-half of the year. So anticipate that that's largely remained pretty consistent through the third quarter. But that gives you a sense of the magnitude. Ki Bin Kim : Got it. Alright, thank you. Thomas Boyle : Sure. Operator : Well, go next to Rob Simone with Hedgeye Risk Management. Rob Simone : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Hope all is well. I have a longer-term question on third-party management. You guys are somewhat unique in that unlike some of your peers, and it's a credit to you, you actually attribute expenses to that platform specifically, which is really helpful. Between now and the 500 Rob Simone : stores. What is the crossover point for you guys? Or could you talk a little bit about the crossover point when you get firmly into the green in that business. And then from a margin perspective, what do you think that could potentially scale to? And I ask that because we're used to looking at property management fees as a singular line item with a lot of the costs kind of buried in other segments or in G&A. So just trying to pick your brains on how you think about that. Joseph Russell : Yeah, sure. So, there's a couple of components in there. One is obviously, we've been ramping the size of that business, and one of the most vibrant areas of demand from our customer base for that business line is from folks that have developed new properties. And so as we take on those properties, the profitability of a new property is less than one of one that has stabilized obviously, given the revenue nature of the fees. And so as we ramp that program, similar to our development business almost, there's a ramping of the profitability of each individual store. So set another way, it's going to take several years before the volumes that we're anticipating really start to produce the P&L impact that you might anticipate.  The second piece of your question relates to what are the margins of that business? And there's a couple of factors there. So one is clearly the geographic mix of the properties themselves, what the operating costs are that they're tied to them, but if you just look at them overall and you say, okay, where can we get different margin basis versus the fees we're charging? And I think, a reasonable margin is probably in the 20s to 30%. But again, a lot of variability as we add a significant number of properties to that's store base over the next several years. Rob Simone : Got it. And would you guys ever consider -- I mean, I know obviously you're deploying a lot of capital right now and there's still some capacity, but would you ever consider a JV Program with maybe a capital partner? I know Joe mentioned in his remarks that a lot of folks out there are rethinking about their timing to an exit. Are there opportunities to do a JV program where you also participate in the third-party management? And it just -- it grows the pie so to speak. Joseph Russell : There will likely be opportunities just like that, Rob. So I would tell you that we're open to a variety of different scenarios as we're engaging in different ownership groups, whether they are currently or anxious to get into self-storage. So that's definitely something that we'll continue to evaluate. And as those opportunities arise, we'll certainly be able to give you more color on those. Rob Simone : Yep. Understood. Okay. Just thinking about the strategic thinking. All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Be well. Thomas Boyle : Okay. Thank you. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey, good morning on the West Coast. Just a continuation from Todd 's question earlier on using equity financing for acquisitions. Did those sellers ask for the 80 million of units to avoid triggering tax events or did you offer those as a sweetener to get a deal done? We just haven't seen, I think, shares or units offered since Shurgard 15 years ago. Thomas Boyle : Yeah. It's a good question. And it really is driven by the fact that there are sellers out there that are interested in accepting our shares as currency, and that's something we're open to. You're right, it\u2019s the first time we've done it in a number of years. But we're open to it, and it can be an attractive way to transact with the sellers that are interested there. Jonathan Hughes : Okay. And as perhaps the share price moves a little higher, cost of equity gets a little more attractive, you would be open to using those shares or units for large portfolio deals, say like another several billion-dollar acquisition, that fair? Thomas Boyle : Sure. I think the way we think about the return profile of our deals is typically on a non-levered basis. And so we're evaluating what the return profile is, either on a leverage neutral basis or unlevered basis. And so as we look at ultimately the financing of these transactions, we've had the opportunity to continue to use unsecured debt and preferred as the core piece of the capital structure, but as volumes grow, it will make good financial sense to continue to broaden the sources of capital, and the benefits of that growth will continue even with using maybe higher costs equity or JV equity, potentially. Jonathan Hughes : Yeah. Okay. And then I just have one more, if I may. One of your peers said they expect a greater than inflation level of on-site labor cost increases next year. It's fair to say we'll see that maybe even slightly a higher level from your portfolio since you did just stomp wages, 7.5% a month ago. Joseph Russell : So as I mentioned, Jonathan, yeah, the labor market is highly competitive. It's definitely somewhat unpredictable as well. But I'll tell you it's a difficult time to attract and retain personnel at any level of skill across the entire organization. So we're going to continue to look at the benefits of making either changes to wage rates and or balancing that with a variety of different efficiencies we're seeing with the transition of our operating model as well. So we're going to continue to monitor that and likely see, again a very competitive environment going into next year. Jonathan Hughes : Alright, that's it for me, thanks for the time. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instruction] We'll take the next question from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, thanks so much for the time. When you talk about -- I think you made a comment about the expansion of the portfolio, 19% spent 2020. Clearly you're in a very strong market, strong demand, and so forth. But over the next 2 to 3 to 4 years, does that lend itself the opportunities to think about what markets you really want to own long term, and potentially sell some assets? Probably not today given how strong the markets are but just how are you thinking about the portfolio long term. Thanks. Joseph Russell : Yes, Ron, that's definitely something that we have a, I would call it a fluid analytical approach too. Meaning that we're always looking to and understanding the impact in value of assets across multiple markets, evaluating the benefit of either continuing owning and/or at whatever point thinking about recycling any level of capital tied to existing assets. So that's an ongoing process that we'll continue to look to and its definitely part of the internal process that we use relative to the way that we're seeing value creation from existing assets. And then the opportunity potentially to recycle. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second question was just asking the COO appointment question a different way. I know you mentioned opportunities, maybe introduced new products to the operations team. But should we think about this as incremental change? Or is this a revolutionary new ways of doing business and operating? Just trying to get a little bit more color how we should think about the impact of this new COO role. Joseph Russell : Well, I'd go back to the things that we described in our Investor Day, where we gave a fair amount of detail on the variety of ways that we're enhancing our operating model, through investments in technology and then different channels and different opportunities we're giving customers, to engage with us, across a whole spectrum. As well as the things that we continue to be focused on relative to people development and the types of opportunities internally that we think are very well suited to continue to grow the quality of our workforce. So the role that David 's coming into, isn't new to the Company in the context of our goals and the strategies that we have. It's just an added level of leadership that we think is prudent as we move the business forward. And we're accelerating the pace of change that ties to the amount of investment that we're making in our people directly, as well as the technological platforms, particularly as it relates to the digitization of the business. So it's one added layer of leadership that we think is well timed and we really look forward to continuing to optimize the way that we're running the Portfolio as a whole, including the way that we're also engaging and giving a variety of different opportunities to our existing employee base. So really good time for him to come into the business, and as I mentioned, we're excited about the fresh perspective he is going to have as well. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thank you. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Spencer Hallway [indiscernible] Spencer Hallway : Thank you. With this widespread supply chain issues, we've been seeing an increasing number of companies keeping what's being called just-in-case Inventory. Have you guys noted any incremental business-related demand in recent months? Joseph Russell : Do you mean from just core customers coming to us the -- differently or trying to use space because of maybe keeping goods at more immediate availability? Spencer Hallway : Yeah. Exactly. Joseph Russell : Yeah, I couldn't point to, Spencer, an exact lift in demand based on that, but it wouldn't surprise me based on the variety of different business customers that do use self-storage in a way that's more spot oriented where they may have an elevated level of demand that they need to cater to, and by virtue of that, storage can fit that need quite easily. So there's likely some benefit that we're seeing from that in many markets. Spencer Hallway : Okay. And then just on the expense side, where would occupancy need [Indiscernible] for us to begin to see marketing costs creep back up in a material manner? Thomas Boyle : Spencer, I would say that that's a pretty dynamic and local decision that we manage. And I wouldn't necessarily say it's an occupancy-based item. It relates to what we're seeing in the customer funnels. So advertising has a benefit to increase top of funnel, the number of people that are say, searching for Public Storage or are finding Public Storage when they go to search for self-storage. And so, that is helpful in markets where we're seeing top of funnel demand erode. But we have other tools as we're managing revenue. Be it, pricing, promotion etc. that will impact conversion, within that funnel.  And so I would say we're watching the different components of the funnel and what the returns are associated with pulling those different levers. To-date, we continue to see strong top of funnel demand across the board. Web visits, for instance, in the quarter were up North of 20% across the system, calls into our call center were roughly flat. So overall, still very solid, top of funnel demand, which led to the decision-making around marketing in the quarter. As we've demonstrated in the past, if we start to see those dynamics change, we typically do see pretty good returns on our advertising spend and we'll pull that lever as well. Spencer Hallway : That's very helpful. Thank you. Thomas Boyle : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan Morgan. Mike Mueller : Hi. Just wondering, for All Storage, what did you assume for rate growth through 2025 to get to your 6% stabilized yield expectations? Thomas Boyle : Yeah. One of the things that we looked at within the portfolio is obviously there's a pool of properties that have recently been delivered that we have the opportunity to lease up, and then ultimately stabilize on a rate basis until we go through our underwriting process of seeing what our stores in the area and what competition is, and ultimately what we think we can squeeze from a revenue standpoint within our own revenue management platform, and we'll underwrite those there. And then on the stabilized stores, we call them stabilized, but the reality is, they're not in our platform. And like we're seeing in acquisitions to date, really, through last year we have an opportunity to put our operating platform and systems in place and drive further improvements.  So you can see for instance, where our overall Dallas portfolio rental rates are. And obviously, these properties have their own submarkets and underwritten rates. But it gives you a sense as to the upside in rental rates that we think we can achieve in the portfolio over time. Mike Mueller : Were you embedding additional rate growth beyond current market or just pulling them up to current market and assuming that it's capped out there? Thomas Boyle : Yes, it's a combination of where we think rates are today, so spot rates. And then, ultimately, that the runway we see for rental rate activity counterbalanced with one of the questions earlier around rental rate risk due to new development within that market in those submarkets, which is a consideration as we think about forward rents, as well. So, a combination of a number of those things. But I would point you to the presentation where you can see our same-store rents in Dallas punching at $15 per foot versus the in-place rents there in the third quarter at about $11. So there's definitely occupancy and rental rate upside. Mike Mueller : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Boyle : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Smedes Rose with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hi, it's Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Joe, we're going to go back to go back to the hiring of a new COO because I think you've gone down, not you, but the Company has gone down this path previously and every time that COO came on there wasn't -- it never stuck. And so I'm just curious at the start to, as you've now rehired for the COO position, what's different this go around versus other initiatives in the past on this topic? Joseph Russell : Well, yeah. Part of the history, Michael, I don't know if I agree it never stuck. I mean, we've had in our history obviously predating my tenure here, periods of time where you had multiple year COO positions in place and then by virtue of the dynamics of the business, we've made different changes. For instance, taking some senior leaders, for instance, on sabbatical to go over to Shurgard for 1 or 2 years at a time, etc. So it's been somewhat of -- I would agree, somewhat of a fluid position by name, but by responsibility and focus, it's been with us consistently. One of the things that is different relative to the opportunity that we see at this point to bring in as I characterize even more fresh perspective and more additive leadership capability to that overall role as the dramatic growth and change in our business.  As I've noted, we've acquired a sizable amount of assets over the last couple of years, literally the size of some of our competitors. And it's been a great opportunity for us to continue to think about how the business is changing, the different tools that we're putting in place, the investments that we're making, and as importantly, the skills and the development of our employee base tied operations. So it's a great time for us to put even that much more emphasis on the role, and we're excited about what we can continue to do with David's leadership coming in, and the things that we're very focused on relative to the overall effectiveness of our operations team has as a whole. Michael Bilerman : What are those top three priorities for him in the next call it 90 to a 180 days. And can you talk about any restructuring underneath him in terms of the team, or how you're going about -- as you've talked about the business set is changing. You didn't have 50% doing online, contactless a few years ago. So you talked a little bit about what the priorities are and things like that. Joseph Russell : Well, here's a number priorities that's coming in one of the business. I mean, that's the way we've all come into the business. Being as focused on the front lines as possible and that's definitely a top priority and it's not to come in and make massive change or retool something that's broke. It's an opportunity to enhance and optimize many of the great foundational investments that we've made that frankly, are statistically, in a whole differently than what you're seeing with other operational platforms. As I mentioned, e-rental, 50% of our customers use e-rental.  That's amazing, where plus or minus 40,000 to 50,000 customers a month are using that channel that did not exist less than 8 or more than 18 months ago. So we're confident that we have a foundation that continues to unlock really good opportunities the way we're running the entire operational team. And we're excited about what we can do with David coming on the team as well. Michael Bilerman : Can you give us some insights on what David did at UPS in terms of the changes that he initiated, at the store level which my local UBS Store it has gotten a lot better over the years, so hopefully you will driver of that, but talk a little bit about, sort of the characteristics and what drew you to him, about what he's been able to accomplish in this prior rule? Joseph Russell : Well, there's no question that that platform is very transaction-oriented, it's very customer - centric, it's tied to again, advancement in their own operating model. And we really liked many of the skills and the attributes of that kind of a transactional. environment, and how it relates to what we see in self-storage. So a lot of very good things that we can learn from that environment, and then, he'll be learning from our environment as well, and we can create the best of both worlds. Michael Bilerman : Great. And just last question on this topic. You don't have a lot of -- I think it's only in the Hawaii asset in terms of having store front retail at the self-storage facility. Is that an opportunity that you're thinking about? And I think someone mentioned revolutionary. Are you thinking differently about the store front real estate that you have? And given the fact you mentioned 60% of people are doing it online, how much is that store differentiation or additive things that you can bring into that real estate to drive incremental cash flow. Could you be an Amazon pickup and delivery service type of thing, it's like -- is that part of the focus at all for the Company? Joseph Russell : It's a good question, and I will tell you there's all variety of strategic opportunities that we'll be more than happy to share as they evolve. There's a lot of creativity that continues to surround the customer-driven demands that we're seeing as customers continue to shift the way they want to interact with any type of business, particularly ours. And we think they are very vibrant opportunities going forward. And as those arise, we'll be sharing those with you. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thanks, Joe. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon, Joe and Tom. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. How do you think about the risks associated with doing several large acquisitions at a time, when yields are as low as they've been? And, can you talk about how Public Storage can maximize the growth of these acquisitions on your platforms? Joseph Russell : Yes, sure Michael. I mentioned we've had obviously a fair amount of volume over the last couple of years, but it ties to the scale and the ability on our part to integrate assets, whether on a one-off basis, smaller, even large portfolio. even when it's highly concentrated, as of what you saw with ezStorage, and now again, with the All-Storage Portfolio in two big metropolitan markets. But it points to the ability that we have from a structure and a scale and operating prowess standpoint. So we're deep in these markets. We've got very strong teams that run these assets day in and day out. Our systems allow very efficient integration. And we've been doing this for many, many years.  And with the investment we've made with our technological platform, we certainly can do it in higher degrees of volume and higher degrees of concentration. The yields that we'll likely see. from this integration are, as we've mentioned, compelling. Again, it ties to the fact that we have the inherent skill and benefit from the investments that we've made in to do just this. So our capital structure as well, due to the continue to fund the kind of growth that we've seen and there's no question the team as a whole, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is continuing to do a great job with the integration and the ability for us to actually improve pretty dramatically the performance on most of the assets we continue to buy. Michael Goldsmith : That's helpful. And the second year in a row where teams -- the occupancy moderation from the summer to the end of the year is less than in the past, so do we think this is new norm, or is this kind of just kind of a unique circumstances surrounding the last couple years, and we should return to the more seasonal decline in future years. How are you thinking about that? Thomas Boyle : Yes. So last year was certainly a unique year, where we saw different seasonal patterns because of the nature of the healthcare environment last year. And we didn't see much if any of an occupancy decline as we moved through the year. This year, we did see a more seasonal pattern and frankly had the benefit of some of the seasonal demand driver's, things like home sales and DIY projects over the summer, for instance, college students, etc., that will add to demand in the Summer, but then we'll then move out as we move into the Fall. So there was that additive demand this year, but we are seeing a little bit more moderation. One of the reasons why we're seeing that moderation is the continued stickiness of the tenant base.  And so we've had fewer move-ins this year. And so recent move-ins are the most likely to move out. And so we've had a contribution of that benefit and a little bit more seasonality this year. I do think that the seasonal demand drivers that have been driving self-storage demand for years will continue to play out over the next several years, and so we operate a seasonal business and it will be going forward. The degree of it, we'll need to see year-in and year-out, but we are seeing a little bit more this year, but still really encouraging overall customer behavior. Michael Goldsmith : Just one last one for me. You mentioned the change in tax laws as a catalyst for the elevated transaction volumes this year. Do you expect the transaction volume to dry up next year, or continue throughout an elevated pace? Thanks. Joseph Russell : Well the amount of motivation seems to be strong. Just put it that way, relative to existing owners wanting to bring more product to market. So Mike and his team continued to be very busy as we transition into things we're working on going into 2022. So always tough to predict, but at the moment it looks like 2022 could be [Indiscernible] Operator : I will now hand the call back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks Emma. On behalf of the entire team on our side, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I look forward to speak with many of you next week and in the coming weeks and take care. Operator : This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the phone will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Katherine. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, feel free to jump back in queue with anything additional. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin the call by reviewing a few of the significant highlights from 2021 and then discuss our outlook for 2022. Last year, the Public Storage team unlocked opportunities in one of the most historically vibrant eras for the self-storage industry. Our priorities have included capturing excellent customer demand, enhancing operations through the digitalization of our platform, acquiring individual assets and portfolios that provide outsized growth, and our ongoing investment in our people. On top of this, we have funded growth through a combination of exceptionally low-cost debt and preferred issuances giving us significant firepower to expand the business going forward. There are four areas that were critical to our success in 2021, which have also set the stage for an equally, if not more powerful, 2022. First, listening to our customers. We found innovative ways to solve what many new customers told us they wanted, a fast and efficient way to lease a storage space on their own time frame. Through our e-rental offering, approximately 50% of our new customers now self-select their space digitally. No operator in the industry comes close to this level of adoption. Our existing customers told us they wanted more tools to interface with Public Storage. This led to the full rollout of the PS app, which now has over 1 million downloads, offering an array of self-directed service options, including digital property access and account management. Second, driving our industry-leading 4-factor growth platform. We acquired 232 assets totaling 22 million square feet for approximately $5.1 billion, adding quality and scale to our market presence, nationally. This included two $1.5 billion-plus portfolios, which were additive to our operating platform in the desirable markets of Washington, D.C. and Dallas Fort Worth. Through development, the Public Storage real estate and construction teams grew our pipeline to approximately $800 million as we deliver Generation Five properties to markets from coast to coast. And we added 79 assets across 22 states to our management platform with easy integration of both, existing and newly built assets. Third, an ongoing commitment to invest in our people. In 2021, we increased hourly wages by 14%. We enhanced training to facilitate career progression with new positions in field operations. And recently, we were named by Forbes as one of America\u2019s best large employers. Then fourth, the effective utilization of our powerful balance sheet. We issued $5 billion of new debt instruments, refinanced $1.2 billion of preferred equity, and took the overall blended cost of debt and preferred from 3.9% to 2.7%. As we enter 2022, the balance sheet is primed to fund growth. We have approximately $1 billion in cash and will likely generate another $700 million in free cash flow. Now, turning to this year. We have launched 2022 with a high degree of confidence that Public Storage is poised for another strong year. The components of our outlook are anchored by three areas. One, customer behavior has set the stage for another good, busy season. Through our own data, we see demand from both, traditional and newer factors, including the fifth D, Decluttering. Also, the high cost of housing, a strong economy, generational adoption of self-storage and business users continue to create a vibrant customer acquisition and retention opportunity. Two, limited growth in new supply nationally. Our view is we are in a three-year holding pattern of new supply deliveries, which began in 2021. We are likely to see a range of 500 to 600 property deliveries take place annually through 2023 due to elevated risk tied to city approvals, higher component, labor and land costs. And three, our commanding non-same-store portfolio, which is now 25% of our total portfolio. With the investment activity in 2021, our non-same-store portfolio has grown significantly and is now comprised of 513 assets, approximately 50 million square feet and has current occupancy of approximately 84%. The earnings power tied to the sizable asset base is significant and will likely continue. The portfolio is suited for outsized growth due to the quality of the assets, exceptional locations and the lease-up activity we see as self-storage demand continues, particularly under the Public Storage brand. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. We finished the year with strong financial performance. We reported core FFO of $3.54 for the quarter and $12.93 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range and representing 21.9% growth over 2020. Now, let\u2019s look at the contributors for this quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 13.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. That performance was consistent with the last quarter despite tough comps and a modest return of seasonality through the fall. Growth was driven by rate with two factors leading to the continued strength. First, strong demand and limited inventory allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 19% versus 2020. We\u2019re comparing to pre-pandemic levels, 33% versus 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also contributed with lengthening customer stays in comparing to a period in 2020 when we were impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets. Now, on to operating expenses. As we had discussed on prior calls, we had higher expense growth in the fourth quarter driven by property tax timing. But if you look at the full year operating expenses, we reported same-store operating expense growth down 2%, representing record company performance. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 12.2% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter, adding $61 million in NOI or roughly half of the full portfolio NOI growth. Now, I\u2019m going to shift gears to the outlook. We introduced 2022 core FFO guidance with a $15.20 midpoint, representing 17.5% growth from 2021. We\u2019re anticipating another year of strong customer demand for self-storage, as Joe highlighted earlier, leading to same-store revenue growth of 13.5% at the midpoint, roughly in line with second half \u201821 growth levels. As we look at the components of revenue, occupancy is likely to fall as we move through the year but remain above 2019 levels. Rate will be the strongest driver of performance going forward. Continued strength from move-in rents and existing tenant increased contribution. Notably, the long-running rent restrictions expired in Los Angeles, adding circa 1.5% to 2% on the full company same-store revenue outlook. Los Angeles is our largest market poised to accelerate with our industry-leading portfolio and team as well as our recently completed capital investments in this market through our Property of Tomorrow program. On expenses, our expectations are for 6% to 8% expense growth, driven primarily by property tax and payroll growth. That leads to NOI growth at the midpoint of 15.7%, roughly in line with 2021 strong performance. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2022, growing from $281 million of NOI contribution in \u201821 to $450 million at the midpoint for 2022. Included in that is our plan to add $1 billion in acquisitions and $250 million of development deliveries this year. Looking ahead past 2022 for the non-same store, we added one element to our guidance for the year compared to last year. The incremental non-same-store NOI to stabilization from the acquisitions and developments completed ahead of year-end \u201821. It represents the annual incremental NOI to be gained at stabilization in addition to our 2022 NOI expectations for those properties. It equates to approximately 5% yields on recent acquisitions and 10% yields on development, and we anticipate capturing roughly half of that embedded growth in \u201823 and the rest over \u201824 and \u201825. This pool of lease-up assets will be a powerful growth engine over the next several years. And last but not least, our low leverage balance sheet gives us capacity to fund growth and, at the same time, is well laddered with long-term debt and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions against a rising interest rate environment. In addition to external financing, we expect to retain approximately $700 million of cash flow to reinvest into our growth for the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Joe. Joe Russell : Thanks, Tom. In summary, we look at 2022 as another milestone year for Public Storage. We are also reflecting on our past as we look to the future by officially marking our 50th year as the largest owner and operator of self-storage in the United States. I want to thank you for your support, and on behalf of our 5,500 associates of Public Storage, thank you for your confidence in our abilities to lead this industry into the next 50 years. And with that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Elvis Rodriguez with Bank of America. Elvis Rodriguez : Good morning, out there. And congrats on the quarter and year. Quick question on the same-store pool. I know there\u2019s been discussion on potentially the conservatism in your pool versus peers. Tom, are you able to share how much more you think same-store NOI would have been -- the outlook would have been, if you followed your peers\u2019 definition? Tom Boyle : Well, stepping back, the way we approach same-store reporting is to report in our same-store the properties that have been stabilized for several years for comparable purposes. So, we look at both, how the occupancy is set up versus the market as well as how rents are versus the local submarkets. And because of that, our same-store represents truly stabilized operating performance year-in and year-out. That said, we just spent some time talking about the power of our non-same-store and the growth that\u2019s embedded there. And you can see in our supplement, the yields that we\u2019re achieving there and the growth that\u2019s embedded, as I just spoke to. So, we\u2019re also achieving that non-same-store growth. As it relates to what our peers report, I won\u2019t get into their reporting versus ours or otherwise, but would highlight the growth potential in our non-same-store pool of unstabilized assets as well as our core reporting for our same-store. Elvis Rodriguez : Great. And just to follow up on the LA moratoriums expiring. I know you mentioned 1.5% to 2% on the revenue side. Are you able to share what the contribution is on the NOI side? Tom Boyle : I\u2019d have to do some quick math there. It\u2019s going to be a little bit north of that, given operating leverage, but we can get back to you on what exactly that number is. But 1.5% to 2% on the revenue side, and as we highlighted, 6% to 8% operating expense growth. So that\u2019s the difference. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Can you break down the components that give you comfort guiding to the same-store revenue guidance, well up to 15%? And that\u2019s coming on the tougher comparison. So, we understand that all the restrictions of LA County adds 150 to 200 basis points. But can you help us understand kind of what\u2019s driving -- is there a change in existing customer rent increases, or what your expectation is for kind of street rates for the upcoming year that gives you comfort to get to that higher level? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, let me take a stab at that. And Joe, you can chime in as well. As Joe mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to see strong customer momentum as we begin the year. And we\u2019re starting the year, frankly, with the best rent growth and record occupancies heading into 2022. So, that certainly is encouraging. As we move through the year, what we\u2019re already experiencing is continued strong move-in rent trends, and we\u2019d anticipate that to continue through the first half of the year as we compare against early 2021. And then we expect move-in rent trends to moderate as we move to the back half of the year. We\u2019re already seeing that in certain markets. If you look at a market like New York, that was stronger out of the gate in 2020 per se but has moderated in growth since, still at pretty healthy growth rates for the quarter, is experiencing move-in rate growth in the fourth quarter in the 7% range. So, we\u2019ve seen that growth start to moderate in certain earlier recovery markets. So, we anticipate that to play through in the system. At the same time, as we sit here today, we\u2019re seeing really strong contribution from markets like Miami and Atlanta who experienced north of 30% move in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019ve got some room to moderate from here. The second component with that as it relates to new customer demand is seasonality. We talked in the past about how we expected some return to modest seasonality in 2021, and we saw that. If you looked at occupancy trends from peak to trough in 2020, which was an unusual year given the pandemic, we saw about a 40 basis-point occupancy decline from peak to trough. Last year, in 2021, we saw about 170 basis-point decline from peak to trough. And in 2022, our expectations are for a more normal year, again, easing into more seasonal patterns with about a 250 basis points peak to trough decline. The third piece, which is really important, is the existing tenant rate increase contribution, which I highlighted, which will further add to the move-in rent momentum on rate. And you highlighted, is there something different there? And there certainly is. We just highlighted that in LA County, for instance, we\u2019ve been subject to rent restrictions for a number of years. That hadn\u2019t allowed us to utilize our existing tenant rate increase program as we typically would. So, that\u2019s certainly the case in Los Angeles, but it was the case in other markets as well through the back half of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021. So, we have tailwinds on existing tenant rate increases because of that as well as the lengthening customer stays, which gives us the ability to send more increases on a year-over-year basis than we\u2019ve done in the past. And Joe, anything you\u2019d like to add to that? Joe Russell : Yes. And just with all that said, Michael, another area that I touched in my opening comments is the environment from a supply standpoint is materially different than it has been over the last several years, even though we\u2019re likely to see continued deliveries. You know that we\u2019re the only public developer of self-storage assets on a national basis. We\u2019ve got the biggest team out there looking and sourcing both land sites and taking assets through various stages of development. And I\u2019ll tell you the amount of hurdles that are in today\u2019s environment are much tougher, and it\u2019s giving us a nice window to point to the number of levels of metrics and the level of confidence that Tom just talked about why this year is likely to be every bit as vibrant as what we saw in 2021. And we don\u2019t really see any looming evidence of a surge of new development coming into play outside of what we\u2019re going to see in 2022 and likely 2023. So overall, it\u2019s a continued good window for us to operate with good pricing power, low levels of supply and very good customer demand, both new and then existing customer behavior. Michael Goldsmith : And as a quick follow-up, since you touched on New York and Miami markets, can you just talk a little bit about New York as an example of -- is that going to -- you\u2019re kind of leading the way, I guess, in terms of like the maturation as we kind of enter this post-pandemic phase. And should rest of your markets sort of follow a similar curve where you\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a moderation in the rent growth there? Thanks. Tom Boyle : I do think that there\u2019s an element of that that I think resonates. I think if you look at our strongest markets in the summer of 2020, they were San Francisco and New York. And we saw some dislocation related demand as well as moving activity and the like. And those markets have remained strong, but they haven\u2019t continued their acceleration, like you\u2019ve seen in the Miami or Atlanta, where really pro-cyclical demand drivers, as we talked through last year, employment growth, population growth, housing activity really driving strong demand where we see that continued to accelerate through 2021. I do think that we look at those markets as -- meaning New York and San Francisco as markets where we may be past the peak levels of demand but remain very, very healthy. You look at San Francisco for the fourth quarter, for instance, occupancy was down 130 basis points, but the 96.4% occupied and continued momentum in that market. And so, I do think that that\u2019s a case of what could be a medium-term stabilization for some of these markets as the growth matures, but we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. But as we sit here today, Miami\u2019s fourth quarter growth was at 23%. It was up 100 basis points in occupancy, and move-in rents were up 31% in the quarter. So, continued really strong momentum in Miami, which is one of our largest markets as well. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : I\u2019m going to try to speak slowly since I\u2019m hearing a pretty big echo. Revenue growth has been incredibly strong in your Sunbelt markets, and I think it\u2019s safe to say, those are more free markets, not subject to pricing restrictions, like LA. So, as you look ahead to 2022, obviously, comps are difficult. But how do you expect the occupancy and rate to trend in the Sunbelt markets? Do you see more kind of occupancy loss versus the overall portfolio as maybe strong in migration to those markets kind of unwind? And then on the rate side, do you think more like high-single-digit rate growth versus what appears to be low-double-digit embedded in the overall revenue growth guidance? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, maybe let me take the second part of that question first, which is what do we anticipate in some of the Sunbelt markets we\u2019re seeing real strength. And I\u2019d say, certainly, as you look at occupancy growth, we\u2019re at 97.2% occupancy in Miami in the quarter. There\u2019s not a lot of room for that to move higher. It really is a rate story, and we are achieving strong rental rate growth, as you highlighted there. And I think that there\u2019s a continuation of that as we get through the year. But no question, we\u2019re going to have much tougher comps in the second half in places like Miami and Atlanta. So, we\u2019re likely to see that rate of growth moderate but at those higher rents, i.e., we\u2019re not expecting to see significant deceleration or going backwards in operating fundamentals, given the -- what we think is the durability of demand in those markets. So, hopefully, that... Jonathan Hughes : Yes. That definitely answers the question. And my last one, so looking at NOI growth guidance and the flow-through to earnings. If same-store NOI growth guidance is, say, 16% this year, how is FFO growth guidance not significantly more than that? You\u2019ve done a great job utilizing the balance sheet to fund last year\u2019s acquisitions with low fixed rate debt and preferreds. But why aren\u2019t we seeing the leverage impact flow through to earnings in a more meaningful way? Tom Boyle : Sure. That\u2019s a good question. So, if you take a look at the contributions of growth in 2022 and compare them to 2021, clearly, one of the big drivers of growth outside of the same-store pool is going to be our acquisition activity. And if you look at the two chunky quarters of acquisition volumes last year, we had the ezStorage transaction, and a number of others take place in the second quarter of last year, which really were contributors to 2021 growth. And in addition to that, that portfolio, in particular, was a more stabilized portfolio. It came in at 86% occupied, and we were able to achieve improved operations there pretty quickly through the year such that we recognized a good bit of the growth there. If you think about the fourth quarter activity and a lot of the other activity and acquisitions last year, much of it was unstabilized. So we spent some time talking about the All Storage portfolio and the stabilization to come there on our last call. And so, what that means is it\u2019s coming in at lower yields given lower occupancies and rental rates, and we\u2019re going to seek to stabilize those portfolios over the next several years, which leads to the embedded growth that I spoke to in \u201823, \u201824, \u201825, but also means there\u2019s going to be less of a big bang impact per se in 2022. But ultimately, we\u2019ll see how the path of that lease-up takes place over this year and the coming years, and we\u2019ll update you on that in coming calls. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : First question, I just wanted to touch on the uplift to same-store revenue growth that you\u2019re anticipating in LA and in California in general. Can you just talk about the expected cadence of that incremental contribution to the top line? I\u2019m curious if growth is going to accelerate throughout the year somewhat ratably or -- and also whether you would expect more upside in 2023, or do you anticipate the full benefit to be largely realized in \u201822? Tom Boyle : That\u2019s a great question, Todd. So, I think if you look at the different markets and the growth profiles, you highlighted LA, and so I\u2019ll spend some time on that, but I want to talk about the portfolio as a whole. So we went through a period last year where we saw acceleration really across the board in all of our markets. And we\u2019re sitting here in early 2022, talking about the tailwinds that we have in LA, which is our largest market. No question, it\u2019s poised to accelerate from here. And as you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re starting from a place where the rent restrictions expired at the end of the year. It will take us some time to see that acceleration play through in the coming quarters, but a good chunk of the rate component of that will be achieved through the busy season this year. So, we\u2019ll have more to talk about as we get through the first half. So, as LA is accelerating and maybe some of the other markets that have been subject to rent restrictions accelerating, we would anticipate that there are others that see a rate of revenue growth start to decline and go the other direction, and that\u2019s kind of inherent in the midpoint of our range being somewhat consistent with what we reported through the second half of 2021. We\u2019re going to have some markets that are accelerating, and we\u2019re going to have some markets that are decelerating. The rate of growth in a market, say, like Miami and Atlanta is unlikely to maintain at these levels, but are likely to still grow at very healthy rates through 2022. So, we are likely heading into a year where we see some acceleration and some deceleration, which we view as healthy into 2022. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then, Joe, your comments about new supply being in a little bit of a holding pattern at about 500 to 600 facilities per year through \u201823, I guess a couple of questions. First, can you elaborate on why you\u2019re not expecting to see an increase in new supply? And what\u2019s holding back development activity from ramping up a bit? And then, 500 to 600 facilities is still relatively elevated. How do you see the delivery of new projects cycling throughout the country? Are there certain markets where you would expect to see some pressure on operations in 2022 from new development deliveries? Joe Russell : So yes, the first part of the question, Todd, there are a lot of headwinds that we see, in particular, as we\u2019re an active developer and we\u2019re in a variety of different stages. So, you\u2019ve got constraints around city processes. Many cities have not even come close to normal levels of operations for approvals. You\u2019ve got supply chain and component availability issues that are not easing in any material way as we\u2019re entering into 2022, and there\u2019s elevated cost that goes with that and labor availability. So, there are a lot of different factors that are creating not only, I would say, material delays in some cases, but it gives many developers a lot of pause to jump into an environment right here where there\u2019s a lot of unknown consequences to both, timing and cost. So, I don\u2019t disagree that 500 to 600, you may step back and go, there\u2019s still a level of volume there. And both, with our own statistics and the data that we derive from other sources, we think that\u2019s a reasonable amount of development activity that\u2019s still at hand. The development business in our sector is highly fragmented, and you\u2019re going to see it continue to play through by, more often than not, small developers that may be going through a process on one site at a time or, in some cases, for the first time. So, there\u2019s a lot of different crosscurrents that are creating the delays that I\u2019m speaking to. And what we see in our own portfolio is more and more angst around committed deliveries; the vendors that you\u2019re dealing with, whether they\u2019re tied to concrete or steel or labor availability. There\u2019s just a lot of different factors that are creating, what I would say, headwinds around elevated levels of deliveries. So, we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re going to be in this holding pattern, both this year and likely into next year. I wouldn\u2019t tell you that any particular markets getting oversupplied. So, that\u2019s a positive thing, where in past cycles, particularly when we were seeing many more properties being delivered nationally, you could see and measure the impacts in certain markets because of the abundance of new supply that was literally hitting the ground and coming up very quickly. So, it\u2019s a very different development dynamic as we speak, and it continues to be a good window for us to go out and compete for land sites. We\u2019re seeing fewer levels of competition, as I\u2019ve talked about for the last several quarters. But to, again, go into the sector right now as a first time or a small developer, you\u2019re going to have a far level and a higher degree of risk, and that\u2019s creating some level of discipline or pull back. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go now to Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser Allaway : Can you just talk about your appetite today for expanding internationally, especially given many of the larger portfolio yields in the U.S. have dried out just specifically thinking about your former interest in the Australian market or expanding further into Europe? Joe Russell : So yes, Spenser, we\u2019ve certainly got the capability to think broader than just domestic opportunities. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen a very vibrant ability to grow and capture well-placed and good opportunities right here in the U.S. We will keep and have the ability to think outside U.S. borders. I\u2019m not going to point to any particular part of the global opportunity. One of the things that comes through with international expansion is the depth of any particular market, the maturity of any particular market, and with that, what kind of opportunity and timing could play for us compared to the opportunities that we see right here in the U.S. So, again, from a knowledge and capability standpoint, we\u2019re very confident when the right opportunities surface. We\u2019re going to be very, I would say, surgical on those kinds of opportunities. But at the moment, we continue to stay very-focused on a very good opportunity set right here in the United States. Spenser Allaway : Okay. And can you provide a little color on how storage fundamentals have been trending in Europe or the Australian market, if you have it detailed? Joe Russell : Yes. I would point you to our associates at Shurgard. They can give you very good color because they\u2019re very deep into the Western European markets, and I would rely on their commentary and perspective on what they\u2019re seeing there. And to Australia, I could only basically just talk to the fact that it is a market that continues to embrace self-storage. There\u2019s good demand factors that play through in the Australian economy. And again, I look to the operators that are in that market to give you even more specific color on what\u2019s going on there. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe just starting with the fact that I think storage has benefited from the uncertainty of the past few years and that the return to normal has taken longer than expected. So, as behavior normalizes, what\u2019s your view on how much of the strength of storage demand is permanent versus thinking that post-COVID normalization is a negative for PSA? Joe Russell : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s definitely a good question and, theoretically, how quickly or will we ever revert back to what things were like pre-pandemic, coupled with the fact the impacts of the pandemic are now a solid two years plus into the overall economy, behaviors, the way companies have reset, again, workforces, the way people are living their lives. There\u2019s a whole different host of different drivers that are at hand beyond just the more obvious factors that might have been tied just directly to the impacts of the pandemic itself. Certainly, at the beginning of the pandemic, the very quick reversion to pure work-from-home environment has created some outsized demand from that alone. But you could argue today, the hybrid situation or the way people have reverted to living lives differently, whether it\u2019s through their own work environments, home environments, the way people are moving and then on top of that, some of the other things, I mentioned in my opening comments, tied to generational demand, a very strong housing market, there\u2019s population shifts that are going on, and there\u2019s certainly strong relativity why, no surprise, Florida and Texas are two of our very strongest markets because of population migration in. So, there are many other factors that continue to drive both, adoption and the need for self-storage. Financially, if you think about the cost of housing, whether you\u2019re an owner or a renter, continues to escalate at a very strong level. And storage can be a very sensible and financial alternative to diffusing some of that cost. So, we\u2019re very confident that the inherent benefits of storage will continue to play through. And the things that we\u2019ve learned through the pandemic, many of which could be longstanding and deep-seated, will continue to serve both us and the sector very well. Caitlin Burrows : You did mention business customers as one of your positive drivers earlier in the call. Could you just talk about these business users and maybe last-mile delivery? In particular, are you seeing increased demand for this? And if so, how significant do you think it could become? Joe Russell : A little bit harder to peg at a specific number, but there\u2019s no question we do see elevated level of business-oriented customers. If you think about how tight and expensive, again, the industrial market continues to be and with changes in distribution, you mentioned last-mile or different distribution patterns or different types of smaller companies needing spot space, what I mean by that is something that they may think they only need for a month or two without having to sign a long-term lease, storage is a great fit. We\u2019ve seen this historically. But with the economy coming back and smaller businesses resuscitating, we\u2019re seeing good levels of business demand come into the portfolio as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go now to Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask a little bit about your development pipeline. I think, you said you were still targeting 10% stabilized returns. And we\u2019ve heard for a while, not just in storage but across multiple asset classes of higher construction costs, higher supply costs, longer lead times, and I\u2019m just wondering, has your yield moved out to where you think you could stabilize? Has it come down from maybe where it might have been, had we not seen increase in construction costs? And if not, like how have you managed to maybe sort of avoid some of these issues? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, let me clarify what I had mentioned about 10% yields. So, the 10% yield that I was speaking to is where we expect the previously delivered developments to achieve stabilization. And you can see in the supplement that, for instance, the 2017 or 2018 development vintages are already north of 8% here in the fourth quarter on an annualized basis. So, I wanted to provide some road map to where the vintages through 2021 are set to stabilize, but that\u2019s not meant to suggest that a 10% yield is our target. What we\u2019ve historically highlighted is, plus or minus 8% property level yield upon stabilization, call it, three or four years out is a target range, obviously, modulates by market and asset type and submarket. But -- so we aren\u2019t moving target yields to 10%, but we do expect to achieve circa 10% on those that have been delivered. And then, the second point is on -- as it relates to construction costs and the challenges associated with development today, I\u2019ll let Joe chime in on that. Joe Russell : Yes. Smedes, as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s elevated, not only timing and execution, but cost pressure that\u2019s playing through. We\u2019ll see how that continues with, hopefully, some easing of some of the supply chain issues that are out there. But there\u2019s no question, labor in and of itself is a very commanding factor. Market to market, that can be quite pronounced. And then, there\u2019s been a high degree of volatility, for instance in steel over the last few months. We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on that. But, if you\u2019re a smaller developer and you\u2019re, either not by experience and/or knowledge or even scale and size, able to deal with some of these wide-ranging cost impacts, as I mentioned, I think there\u2019s going to be more discipline playing through, we\u2019re keeping a very close eye on it. That\u2019s the benefit of having the size and the capability of our own development and construction teams. So, they\u2019re working very hard to see and understand and contain the elevated level of costs that are playing through on asset development right now. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thanks. And you mentioned that the length of stay continues to extend. I was just wondering, could you update us on where that is now? And maybe as a reminder, what was it kind of pre-pandemic? Tom Boyle : Sure. I think one of the metrics that I\u2019d highlight that with is the average length of stay of our customers that are in-house today. And pre-pandemic, that average length of stay was about 33 or 34 months. So, approaching three years, but just a touch under. Today, that average length of stay of the in-house tenants is just about 40 months. So, we moved a meaningful way past that three-year threshold and continue to see that play through the beginning part of this year as well. Operator : The next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Samir Khanal : Hey Tom, I know you mentioned the rent restrictions being lifted in LA. But I mean, is there any potential benefits that could come from other markets this year that we haven\u2019t thought about this as a driver for growth? Tom Boyle : Sure. There were certainly other markets that experience rental rate restrictions and have a similar benefit but not anywhere to the same degree as Los Angeles. And so ,we specifically called out Los Angeles. But as you\u2019d anticipate, there were a number of other markets, including New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, the rest of California, and really many of our markets that at some point over the past two years have rental rate restrictions. And there are modest benefits in those markets as well, but nothing like Los Angeles County, given the duration of those rental restrictions and the size of the Los Angeles market for us. But there are some other tailwinds playing through with existing tenant rate increases because of that through 2022 in other markets also, but always embedded in the outlook that we provided for \u201822. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Elvis Rodriguez with Bank of America. Elvis Rodriguez : Sorry, if I missed this. Are you able to share where occupancy is year-to-date? Tom Boyle : Yes. On a year-on-year basis, we\u2019ve seen occupancy that ended the year, call it, 50, 60 basis points above prior year at record levels. We are starting to see some of that moderation through January and into February. We\u2019re just right around flat at this point year-over-year. But again, at record occupancies for this time of year as we sit here at the end of February. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ronald, you\u2019re line is open. Please check mute function on your phone. We\u2019ll go to Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Mike Mueller : Tom, does guidance assume additional street rate growth in 2022, or is it a little bit more taking what\u2019s in place today, plus the rate increases? Tom Boyle : Yes. If you look at the move-in rents, I think is the term we would like to use, which is what do we actually achieve in rents for customers to sign contracts through the first part of the year, there is a benefit certainly as we look at where we ended the fourth quarter in move-in rents compared to the first quarter of 2021, for instance. And so some of the growth that we\u2019re going to experience is certainly associated with the fact that just maintaining rents from the fourth quarter will be positive year-over-year growth into the first quarter. That is probably the biggest chunk of rental rate growth for move-ins through the first two months of the year, and then we do -- first -- I\u2019m sorry, two quarters of the year. And then we do anticipate modest rental rate growth for move-ins thereafter as well, but certainly moderating from the rate of growth that we\u2019ve seen through the first quarter and third quarter of last year. Mike Mueller : Got it. And then, I apologize if I missed this. But on the acquisitions that are under contract or have closed for 2022, what\u2019s an average occupancy on them? Joe Russell : Close to what we saw in 2021. It averages in the high-50%, low-60%. We\u2019ve got a combination of assets that are in various stages of stabilization in the pipeline. And tactically or strategically, we\u2019re going to continue to look for those assets going forward as well. They\u2019ve been well suited to many of our investment strategies, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right out of the gate here at the beginning of the year. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Can you hear me now? Okay. I can hear myself actually. Just really quickly on the same-store revenue guidance, I just wanted a little bit more color on sort of the upper and the lower end of the range. How are you guys thinking about that? Is it just sensitivity on elasticity on pushing rate? Is there anything else that goes into hitting the top of that guidance versus the bottom? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Sure. So, we did widen the same-store revenue range from, call it, 1.5% range to 3% for this year and trying to capture more of those potential outcomes compared to what we did last year. But in terms of elements that would drive the top end versus the bottom, I think you can probably anticipate what they are, i.e., stronger customer demand, more rental rate strength for move-ins, even longer length of stays in the higher end case. And the flip side, true for the lower end case. So, nothing in particular that I\u2019d highlight that would be unique about the range there. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then, just asking differently. So just to understand, the guidance assumes just normal seasonality where peak leasing season, you should see reacceleration and then slowing down in the later back of the year. Is that how we should think about it? Tom Boyle : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Keegan Carl : Just curious if you could take a stab at quantifying how many of your customers are falling to the new fifth D, Decluttering? Is there any sort of visible shift in the demographics that you\u2019re seeing with your new customer pool? Joe Russell : So, one of the things, we do a vibrant amount of customer surveys with both new and existing customers. So, there\u2019s been some natural gravitation to new generational users that have come into the portfolio through the pandemic needing more space for a variety of different reasons was a more pronounced driver. It hasn\u2019t gone away by any means. It\u2019s moderated a small amount, but it\u2019s still a sizable component of the kind of demand that\u2019s playing through as we\u2019re surveying customer needs as they come into the portfolio. And then, it goes to the whole host of other drivers that we\u2019ve been talking to as well, whether it\u2019s the amount of activity tied to home sales, movement from market to market and then our classic definitions of the other 4 Ds, which are very deep-seated drivers of self-storage in and of itself. The cluttering or Decluttering factor, I do think it\u2019s got some long-lasting effects, not only because there\u2019s still a strong hybrid work environment that\u2019s playing through many economies, but it\u2019s also tied to the cost of either being an owner or a renter. So that, too, is going to create more need for more space at home. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Just a couple of balance sheet questions. You have $580 million of preferred debt -- or equity, sorry, coming due. How should we think about that holistically, just refinance that preferred equity or combination of that? And secondly, I think you have about $700 million of floating rate debt. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s hedged or not, but any additional color on how you\u2019re thinking about that in a rising rate environment? Tom Boyle : Sure. Great question, Ki Bin. So, we have had the opportunity to refinance a significant amount of preferred stock over the last several years. Call it, $2.5 billion of preferred stock has been refinanced at lower rates, and that contributed to the decrease in cost of in-place capital that Joe highlighted earlier. As we move through the year, certainly, we would look to refinance those to the extent that we can lock in attractive, permanent like-for-like capital as well and keep that kind of cornerstone of the capital structure, which is incredibly attractive in a rising interest rate environment, given we\u2019ll never have to refinance the preferred stock and take advantage of opportunities where we can ratchet lower that cost of financing. So, we have, as you mentioned, $580 million that we could potentially address this year, but we\u2019ll have to see where the market is at that time. And then, as it relates to the floating rate question, we did issue floating rate notes as part of the financing package for ezStorage last year. Those are callable notes that we\u2019ll look to refinance here in the coming years. We have not fixed those. So, we have an ability to prepay those and manage the interest rate risk as we go. Ki Bin Kim : And I know this next topic has been brought up from time to time, but just holistically speaking, how do you guys think about your investment in TSG and Shurgard? Are these basically whoever holds, or is it reasonable to expect if you see some acquisition opportunity that these be possible sources of capital? Joe Russell : Yes. Ki Bin, we at a Board level, continue to evaluate the -- both, benefit of our investments in either entity and the commitment that we continue to have in either entity. So, that\u2019s an ongoing Board review process that\u2019s in place. And when and if we make a change in our commitment to either entity, we would certainly communicate that. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the returns that each set of investments have garnered for us, and we continue to be committed to each entity and are pleased by their performance. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Curious on California and LA, specifically, if you can share the loss of lease in the portfolio or what price versus market, and is the main upside same-store revenues from new leasing or in [Technical Difficulty] back to market? Tom Boyle : Great. That\u2019s a very good question. So, we did experience through 2021 a situation where move-in rents and in-place rents were very consistent in Los Angeles. And in fact, move-in rents in some instances moved higher in some of the properties here in Los Angeles because of the dynamics of the rental rate restrictions. That said, the contribution going forward of rental rate growth with the regulations no longer in place are both, move-in rents as well as existing tenant rate increases. So, in other words, we had an inability to increase move-in rents above the rental rate restrictions, the same way it was for existing tenants. So, I would say it\u2019s both parts, both moving existing tenants higher as well as continuing to cycle through new tenants into our portfolio in Los Angeles at higher rents than we\u2019ve done in previous years. So, both sides. Juan Sanabria : Great. Thanks. And then, since David Lee [ph] is on the call. So, curious if he has any intent, since he\u2019s on call, to share. And if not, [Technical Difficulty]. Is that bringing you guys above market, the kind of change in strategy there, or is it just kind of a market to [Technical Difficulty] hourly workers? Joe Russell : Yes. There\u2019s a number of different components that went into the range of wage increases, coupled with, as I mentioned, us putting even more focus on employee development, additional positions within operations. What we continue to do is compete for and reward very strong capabilities within our property management ranks. It\u2019s a tough environment from a competitive standpoint with the wage pressures and just availability of hourly employees. But we think we\u2019ve got very strong and compelling reasons to attract and retain employees, and we continue to use a lot of very vibrant strategies to not only bring very talented property management level employees into the business, but to reward them and give them longer-term career opportunities with us as well. So, it\u2019s a part of the business we continue to focus on very aggressively. And we\u2019re pleased by a number of things that we\u2019ve not only done relative to just pure wage rates but also career and growth opportunities within operations as well. Operator : We have no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Ryan Burke for closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We apologize for the echo that we understand you were hearing during the question session. So, we\u2019ll certainly get that remedied moving forward. We\u2019ll talk to you all soon. Have a great day, and take care. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Katie. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 4, 2022, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. After that, of course, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before I hand the call over to Tom to discuss specific Q1 metrics, I will highlight five areas that are setting the stage for a robust 2022. First, market-to-market business remains very strong. Now that we are four months into the year, we continue to see elevated demand from new customers across the portfolio. Existing customers are also extending average length of stay. We have healthy pricing dynamics, and with move-in rates up 15% and our existing customer rate increase program performing very well. Second, the traditional busy season is taking hold. Inventory is tight with vacancy at about 5%. We see outsized demand for vacant units throughout the markets. Both, consumers and business customers are aggressively seeking space along with more traditional drivers for this time of year, which include home sales and college students. Home affordability, hybrid work environment and a tight commercial market are clearly additive to our performance metrics. Third, our large non-same-store portfolio, now 515 assets across 50 million square feet is growing significantly from a revenue and occupancy standpoint. Non-same-store NOI nearly tripled during the quarter. These assets are highly complementary to our market presence and continue to deliver exceptional returns with outsized move-in activity due to average occupancy of 86%. Of note, the $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio we acquired a year ago has already achieved the yield we anticipated after year two. The recently acquired $1.5 billion All Storage portfolio is performing ahead of expectations as well. Fourth, as anticipated, fewer assets have entered the sales market this year. Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract for 21 assets, totaling approximately $275 million. Our industry-leading development platform increased to $833 million. The forecast of relatively stable national deliveries for 2022 and 2023 remains intact as we anticipate approximately 500 to 600 assets will be delivered each of the next two years. And fifth, our industry-leading digital customer experience continues to be embraced by new tenants. This includes digital leasing, centralized property access as well as our PS app. In March, we reached a significant milestone with our 1 millionth eRental move-in. Today, more than half of our customers are choosing eRental, giving them a desirable digital option to lease a unit. Our ongoing investments in the public storage digital platform are improving both, customer experience and employee efficiency. Clearly, a win-win. Now to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $3.65 for the quarter, representing 29.4% growth over the first quarter of 2021. Our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year and an acceleration from the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 15.8% compared to the first quarter of 2021. That performance is an acceleration from the 13% to 14% range in the second half of 2021. Growth was driven by rate with two factors leading to the continued strength : First, strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 15% versus 2021; second, existing tenant rate increases also contributed with lengthening customer stays as well as comparing to a period in 2021 when we were impacted by rental rate regulation in some of our largest markets. On that note, Los Angeles was a particularly strong contributor accelerating from 8% same-store revenue growth in January to 15% same-store revenue growth in March. Now on to expenses. We had a good quarter on cost of operations, up 3.6% in the quarter, with savings on marketing expense offsetting expected growth in other line items. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 20.5% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter, as Joe mentioned. Now shifting to the outlook. We\u2019re roughly 70 days on from when we introduced our initial 2022 guidance for the year. We reiterated our strong core FFO outlook yesterday with a $15.20 midpoint, representing 17.5% growth from 2021. We\u2019re anticipating another year of strong customer demand from self-storage, and as Joe mentioned, we are experiencing that through April with a very good setup into our traditional busy leasing months ahead. As I\u2019ve highlighted over the past year, with occupancy near record levels, our outlook for growth is driven by rental rate. Shifting gears, PS Business Parks announced it entered into an agreement where Blackstone will acquire the company. We have agreed to vote our shares for the transaction. Upon closing, which is anticipated in the third quarter, we would receive $2.7 billion of cash. And of that $2.7 billion, recognize a $2.3 billion tax gain that would increase our distribution requirements for the year. As we noted in our filings, PSB contributed $25.5 million in core FFO in the first quarter or approximately 4% of company-wide FFO. We have not updated our guidance ranges to reflect this sale, but we\u2019ll plan to update you as the transaction progresses and more details are provided by PSB. Last but not least, our low leverage balance sheet gives us capacity to fund growth and at the same time, is well laddered with long-term debt and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions against a rising rate environment. Perpetual fixed rate capital is very good capital in today\u2019s markets, and so is $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet at March 31st. And with that, Katie, I\u2019ll turn it to you to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. And I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re limited to questions. If we are, please let me know. My first question, I guess, if we could talk about April. You commented on seeing continued demand into April. Can you provide any additional comments on what you\u2019re seeing so far in April? Tom Boyle : Sure. Yes. Joe mentioned, we\u2019re seeing good momentum heading into the second quarter. And we\u2019re seeing that really across the board. Market strengths are pretty consistent through April. Web visits and sales calls are up in the month or were up in the month. We saw good momentum from move-in transactions, move-in rates, which I know is a topic that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re interested in, were up about a little over 12% in the month. We continued to see the occupancy and rate trade off that we saw in the first quarter. So, occupancy ended April down about 120 basis points year-over-year, but again, against the backdrop of really strong rate growth. Joe Russell : And, yes, Jeff, maybe to add a little bit more perspective on the comment I made in my opening remarks. The consumer and business customer environment is still very strong. Consumer balance sheets, by everything that we\u2019re seeing relative to statistical levels of health are quite strong. In fact, consumer balance sheets are better today than they were pre-pandemic. We\u2019re seeing very good business activity across the spectrum. Top of funnel demand, as Tom mentioned, is quite vibrant. And on the back end, length of stay continues to increase as well. So, the two bookends of both demand on the front side and then enduring utility of consumer and business utility of the space is quite strong. Many of the factors that I spoke to continue to play out quite well, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen through the month of April. To your question on how many questions in the queue, we\u2019ll let you ask one more, and then we\u2019ll move on to the next question. Jeff Spector : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s great. I guess, then the easy follow-up question is just on guidance. That\u2019s really been the top incoming to me. I know you guys are conservative. It seems like a great or maybe even better start to the year than expected. Can you explain why maintain the guidance right now? Tom Boyle : Sure. I\u2019m happy to take that. And I guess, what I\u2019d characterize is the year has started out largely right in line with our plan, i.e., strong, but the strong start we anticipated. And, it\u2019s only been 70 days since we set our initial range. When we communicated that, we highlighted that we specifically widened the ranges to try to encapsulate more upside into the ranges compared to maybe last year where we had narrow ranges. And the reason for the width of the range is really the uncertainty as we get into the busy season here and the uncertainty that\u2019s inherent in a month-to-month lease business in the second half of the year. We\u2019re going to learn a lot about how that\u2019s going to play out over the next three months or so, and we\u2019ll certainly provide updates and would expect that as we move through the year, we likely will narrow ranges as we go forward, like we did last year. But, at this point, we feel good about our outlook for the year. And to date, we\u2019ve seen the strong performance we anticipated. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : My first question is on street rates and how do they progress through the quarter and into April? I think given the comparisons are starting to get more difficult, I think the market is trying to understand just how much rates are kind of growing on these more difficult comparisons? Tom Boyle : Yes. That\u2019s clearly a good question and speaks to the uncertainty as we move through the busy season here. To date, we\u2019ve continued to see good momentum in move-in rents and customers willing to accept those higher move-in rents against an environment, as Joe mentioned of tight inventory. So, while occupancy is off year-over-year, we\u2019re still talking about near-record occupancies, which gives us pricing strength when inventory gets tight. We anticipate that inventory will only get tighter from here as we move into the busy season. From a month-to-month standpoint, we saw pretty consistent year-over-year, call it, mid-teens growth on move-in rents through the first quarter. As I noted in April, we\u2019re up a touch over 12% on move-in rents. And we\u2019re already starting to face those tougher comps year-over-year. So, as Joe mentioned, we clearly have momentum here. Now the question will be how does that play out over the next several months to kind of reset rents potentially higher or where they will reset? Michael Goldsmith : Understood. And then, I guess, the piece that kind of goes along with this is the trajectory of ECRIs. Your occupancy was relatively stable in the first quarter, suggesting that length of stay remains strong. And now, as the street rates kind of -- the street rate growth compresses as you face more difficult comparisons, how do you think about applying ECRIs to customers, just given that prices -- market prices are necessarily rising to the same extent that we\u2019ve seen in the past? Thank you. Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Michael. So, Joe mentioned earlier that the existing tenant rate program is going well through the year. And what we mean by that specifically is consumers are behaving as expected. And we continue to run our modeling to derive expected behavior and optimize increases, that will continue through the year. So clearly, one of the inputs to that you\u2019re highlighting, which is moving rents and the cost to replace a tenant if they move out or if we\u2019re wrong on our predictive analytics. But generally speaking, we\u2019re seeing trends in line with what we expected. The one item I\u2019d maybe add to what you asked is we do have some catch-up in certain markets. I highlighted Los Angeles, for instance, and other markets like New York and San Francisco are put in a similar category where we had rental rate restrictions for a good part of the 2020 and into 2021 time period where even as rental rates maybe don\u2019t need to grow as much to see outsized growth in those markets because we\u2019ve got \"catch-up\" to do versus what we would have otherwise sent to date. And so you see that acceleration in Los Angeles in the quarter and would anticipate that continues. Operator : Our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Ki Bin Kim : So, just going back to the April trend, thanks for all the details. I was just curious if there\u2019s been any change in promotion activity or marketing dollars that might be supporting that 12% increase in move-in rates? Tom Boyle : Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Ki Bin. No changes to strategy there. You saw we had marketing dollars that were lower in the first quarter. I\u2019d anticipate that that decline starts to moderate as we move through the year, given comps last year. But overall, advertising spend was lower in April than we had in March, for instance, promotional discounts as we move into this time of the year seasonally adjust lower, and we saw that play out through April as well. So, nothing really to note there out of the ordinary, just overall continued good demand for consumers as well as businesses to store during the month of April, which is helpful set up as we get into May and June. Ki Bin Kim : Got it. And if I take a step back and look at what\u2019s happening in the market in terms of Netflix and Amazon, there\u2019s this notion that -- or concern that the days of sitting at home and watching a Squid Game and shopping on Amazon might be winding down, and part of that kind of trade, if you want to call it that, the kind of COVID winners may be dissipating. And obviously, self-storage is a little bit different to supply and demand dynamic, but work from home and all the changes that happened throughout COVID definitely did help your portfolio and the demand profile. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing anything on the margins that might suggest some of those demand drivers starting to wind down? Joe Russell : Yes. Ki Bin, I would say, we\u2019ve seen a very good balance of, if you call it, some of the wind-down that was purely driven by pandemic, intensity or peak periods of the pandemic, have been compensated for by other things, which include, as I mentioned, affordability from a living standpoint, whether you\u2019re an owner or a renter. That\u2019s always an additive driver to the financial benefit of acquiring a storage unit, financially a lower price point. So, that continues to be very supportive of the demand that we\u2019re seeing. Statistically, from a hybrid and work environment, we\u2019re seeing continued evidence that many companies are continuing to adopt and potentially maintain the level of flexibility for the workforces. That too, continues a very, very healthy driver. Even when certain employees are being pulled back to work, they\u2019re likely not being pulled back on a full time everyday basis. Today, we are seeing what we might see traditionally at this time of year, more college student activity. There\u2019s still good movement relative to home sales, even though interest rates are up, there\u2019s still a very active home sale environment this time of year. So again, many of the more intense drivers through the pandemic, some of those have eased down, we\u2019re seeing other additive, still very compelling reasons, like we\u2019re seeing good customer demand. Operator : Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just curious on the sunsetting of rent restrictions. If you could just provide any update or progress in the ability to recapture what was a loss over COVID and maybe prior to that? You provided a bit of color around the initial guidance with fourth quarter results, but just curious if you have an update on expectations for the impact to same-store revenues for \u201822? Tom Boyle : Sure. I\u2019m going to concentrate my commentary around Los Angeles because it\u2019s our largest market, I think the clearer story. And big picture, we\u2019re seeing strong trends in Los Angeles. The long-running rent restrictions expired at the end of the year. We commented on the last call that we anticipated that event would likely add 1.5% to 2% of same-store revenue to the Company overall outlook. Los Angeles is our largest market, and it\u2019s accelerating. As I noted, the same-store revenue growth acceleration within the quarter. The team recently completed capital investments in that market as well through our Property of Tomorrow program. So, the team was ready for January 1st with good-looking properties and poised to accelerate. So, we are seeing that. And I\u2019d reiterate the commentary around the growth potential coming from that market specifically. Joe Russell : And on top of that, not only our largest market, but it\u2019s also our highest occupied market, nationally. So, we\u2019re close to 98% occupancy. So again, another very strong states that are for the kind of revenue opportunity that Tom is speaking to. Juan Sanabria : Okay. So, no change to the 1.5% to 2% benefit, I guess, from L.A. and other rent restrictions coming off, just to... Tom Boyle : That\u2019s right. We\u2019re seeing the strong acceleration we anticipated. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then, I mean, it sounds like you guys are pretty bullish across all geographies, but we\u2019ve definitely seen some markets kind of lag, whether it\u2019s New York, in some markets, i.e., anything in the Sunbelt. How do you think that dynamic plays out as we go into \u201823? Are you a subscriber to the view that the Sunbelt markets, I guess, the product of just tough comps will normalize to the mean and maybe New York kind of led and is a leading indicator of where the other markets will go, or just curious on how you think this plays out from a geographic perspective? Tom Boyle : Yes. I think you highlighted a good point, which is there is some variability across our markets. We\u2019re seeing really strong demand in the procyclical demand drivers that Joe mentioned, population growth, home activity, et cetera. Florida continues to perform incredibly well. And that\u2019s to date, meaning we\u2019re already starting to face some pretty tough comps in markets like Miami, and Tampa, West Palm Beach, but they continue to perform really well year-over-year. To give you a sense, move-in rents in Miami in the first quarter were up 31%. And similar trends in April. So, really good strong trends there. I do think, over time, we are anticipating that there will be supply that comes into the Sunbelt markets to serve that incremental population growth and the home building activity that\u2019s taking place in many of those markets. And that\u2019s a healthy thing for our industry and for that customer base, which is likely to temper the kinds of rent growth that we\u2019re seeing today. But overall, we\u2019re still seeing good trends. And as Joe mentioned, industry-wide, we\u2019re not anticipating a near-term elevation in new supply, given the challenges related to getting through city processes, the construction process, costs, et cetera, today. So, we\u2019re still seeing good strength there. In terms of New York and San Francisco, maybe just on the flip side, we did see acceleration in those markets that was partly attributable to some of the catch-up I commented on earlier around rental rate restrictions. So, we do have some momentum there. And overall, those markets are still performing really well, but they don\u2019t have the same sort of procyclical drivers that a Miami does or an Atlanta does today. Operator : Our next question will come from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Samir Khanal : So, Tom, maybe to expand on that and kind of talk a little bit about New York. I know it\u2019s only about 5% of your portfolio. Curious how do you think the sort of second half works out here, right? It\u2019s held up well, still lagging the rest of the portfolio. I mean, is it really a supply thing here or are you seeing any sort of move out sort of pick up as folks return back to the city? Tom Boyle : Yes. That\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m not going to speak specifically to second half outlook for markets in particular. But I would say, we aren\u2019t seeing anything overly concerning related to move-outs and the specific question you asked around people returning to the city. So, that\u2019s not a driver that we\u2019ve seen to date. There is some new supply that continues to be absorbed in Brooklyn and parts of Queens. But overall, I would anticipate that that supply does get absorbed. And again, first quarter same-store revenue growth of north of 9% in the quarter accelerating from the fourth quarter is a pretty good place to be in a big market like New York. Samir Khanal : Got it. And then, just shifting gears to the transaction market a little bit. I know for the year, I think you said it\u2019s about $270 million is sort of what you\u2019ve done so far. Your guidance is still at about $1 billion of acquisitions. Maybe provide color on kind of what you\u2019re seeing out there, sort of what\u2019s in the pipeline and sort of pricing as well? Joe Russell : Sure, Samir. The comparable to 2021 was likely to be strong, meaning it was unlikely we\u2019re going to see the same level of trading activity in 2022 that we saw last year. The thing that drove the volume in 2021 was the number of large billion-plus portfolios that came into the market, plus or minus $18 billion of overall transactions took place and almost half of them were tied to those big, very unique portfolios that were in the market at various stages of 2021. As we mentioned even in the earnings call last quarter, we don\u2019t anticipate the same number of large portfolios in the near term coming back into the market this year, and now 4 months in, we haven\u2019t seen that kind of activity emerge. There is still a healthy amount of both, individual and smaller portfolios, say in the $200 million to $300 million range that have either come into the market or will likely come into the market in the coming quarter or two. So, we\u2019ll see how that level of activity matches the kind of smaller activity that we saw in 2021. Pricing is very competitive. I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s any movement yet in cap rates, surprisingly even with interest rates elevating, but there\u2019s a fair amount of pent-up capital that still wants to come into the self-storage sector. So, aggressiveness from buyers remains. We\u2019re seeing some good assets in multiple markets. We\u2019re busy underwriting a number of different transactions, but it\u2019s not the same elevated level of deal flow that either we saw in 2021 or likely to see this year. But, it\u2019s not annual that first quarter is a little quieter. A lot of owners take the first or maybe even sometimes the second quarter to figure out their own playbook relative to bringing assets to market. So, we\u2019ll see how that trends going into Q2 and Q3. And from there, we\u2019ll see what kind of volume plays through. Operator : Our next question will come from Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Keegan Carl : I think first, just given what\u2019s going on in the broader macro economy of inflationary concerns. Have you guys seen any change in your customer demographics and preferences? Tom Boyle : Yes. That is a very good question, and there\u2019s a number of dynamics that we\u2019re watching very closely as we typically do, but given the dynamic changes that we saw through the first quarter, we\u2019re watching particularly closely this year. I\u2019d highlight a few of them. On the demand side, we\u2019re watching to see any shifts in demand. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we continue to see a broad group of demand. We\u2019re not seeing shifts in for instance, cohorts by income or demography shifting year-over-year for new customer demand, and that\u2019s healthy. But, we are watching. As Joe mentioned, home sales is a driver as we move through this part of the year. Interest rates are moving higher. We\u2019ve seen new home sale and existing home sale activity decline on a month-over-month basis, but still sitting at activity levels that are well above pre-pandemic levels, which are supportive to demand. So, again, watching that closely, but nothing that we\u2019ve seen to date. As it relates to other pressure points on the consumer, we spoke earlier about our existing tenant rate increase activity and the fact that consumers are behaving as expected there. So, no shift there. The other pain point would be payment activity. And consumer balance sheets continue to support good payment activity. So, we were looking at some data from a money center bank a week or two ago, highlighting the cash balances are still up meaningfully, nearly double what they were pre-pandemic for American households. And I think the other component is home equity, right? There\u2019s been a wealth creation event for homeowners that is supporting American consumer balance sheets as well. So, those are supportive. Now, I would say, we are seeing delinquency off the lows that we saw during the pandemic, but we\u2019re also not in an environment where stimulus checks are going out. And so, it\u2019s natural to see a little bit of a lift in delinquency, but we remain in a good place and certainly better than where we were pre-pandemic, to date. So, we\u2019re watching all of those drivers pretty closely but to this point, continue to see strong trends across the board. Keegan Carl : Got it. And then, shifting gears a little bit and maybe just a little bit more color on your length of stay. Have the reasons for customers leaving changed at all in recent months? For example, are you maybe seeing more people mention pricing in their reasoning for leaving? Tom Boyle : Yes, no meaningful change there. The biggest driver that people highlight when they leave is that they no longer need the space, which makes sense, right? You think about the use cases for storage at some point, many customers no longer need the space, either because they move or their living situations change, et cetera. So, that continues to be the biggest driver and no change there. In terms of length of stay, Joe highlighted the lengthening of that metric. And on average, our customers that are in place, their average tenure is about 40 months today, and that compares to a pre-pandemic average in 2019 of around 33 months. So, we continue to see really strong tenure, which is supporting both, our pricing strength as well as existing tenant rate increase programs. Operator : Our next question will come from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ron Kamdem : Hey. Just going back to L.A., I think the original guidance, I think you\u2019d mentioned sort of 200 basis points of contribution to the same-store revenue line item. You gave some really good comments at the opening remarks about just same-store hitting 15%. So, the question is, anything changed there? And, can you give us a sense just of how below market those rents are sort of post this expiration or price changing? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Sure. I\u2019d just reiterate what I highlighted earlier, which is we still believe that 1.5% to 2% is the right sort of range. We were obviously starting from a period of a standing start in January when those rental rate restrictions expired. And so, it will take some time to see that acceleration play through, both from new customers coming in at higher rents, older customers leaving us, and then the existing tenant rate program. So, that will take some quarters to season in. But, I specifically highlighted that the January to March trend to just speak to the level of acceleration we\u2019re seeing out of the gates here in 2022. Ron Kamdem : Great. And then, sort of my second question was just looking at average occupancy. We have it down sort of 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. I sort of appreciate your comments about this year is all about rates. And when you see occupancy down, which doesn\u2019t seem like that much, is the sense that there\u2019s potentially more sort of pricing acceleration to be had during the peak leasing season, or just trying to get a sense of how much harder could you push here? Tom Boyle : I think we\u2019ll update you on that next quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from Rob Simone with Hedgeye Risk. Rob Simone : I had like kind of a higher-level strategic question for you. I mean, obviously, the last year has been fairly transformative for PSA and kind of how you communicate and run the business. I guess, looking back over the past year and without -- obviously, you can\u2019t share things that are discussed at the Board level. But if you had to kind of like think about a scorecard on what you hope to accomplish when -- you said about these changes versus what you did, kind of what was successful and what\u2019s like left hasn\u2019t had its box checked yet, unlike what\u2019s left to do in affecting all of those changes and kind of getting the Company to where you wanted it to be? Thanks. Joe Russell : Sure, Rob. Yes, the thing that we were very transparent about and this goes back now almost a year when we did our Investor Day in May of last year was outlining the variety of different strategic initiatives that not only were pronounced from an impact standpoint, but many had been in formation for some time relative to the investments and the opportunities that we saw relative to approaching the market through our technology initiatives. The opportunity that we saw with the quality of assets that we could bring into the portfolio, the expansion of our development program, the way that we\u2019re using data analytics, the digitization of the business. So, we\u2019ve checkmarked a number of different areas that we\u2019ve intentionally been that much more transparent about. I would tell you that the team at large is working very aggressively to continue the optimization in each of those areas. We\u2019re on very good path relative to continuing to deliver more optimization on the way that we\u2019re not only running the business. You\u2019re seeing that through, for instance, our eRental program, very customer effective and very effective from an efficiency and employee satisfaction standpoint, an area that we continue to mine opportunities around through investments and that, again, ties to our development capabilities, and the things that we\u2019re doing very uniquely in the industry by virtue of the size of our team and the way that we\u2019re delivering Gen 5 properties, that also then reverts right back to what we\u2019re doing with our Property of Tomorrow program, where we\u2019re retooling the existing portfolio, adding many amenities that we\u2019ve been putting into these Gen 5 properties, which include solar and efficiencies from that standpoint. So, that all points to a very strong and ongoing commitment to the growth of the business, the investment that we\u2019re making in very different and powerful parts of the business. We\u2019re pleased by the traction. We\u2019re pleased by the business results. But as always, we are very challenged to do more. With a brand like we have at Public Storage, we can continue to expand that brand. You\u2019re seeing that as we invigorated the effectiveness even of the assets that we\u2019ve been buying over the last couple of years in particular, where average occupancy was in, say, the 60% to 65% range. We put them right into the public storage brand, put many of the tools and the operational efficiencies right into those assets, and they do tremendously well. So, the team at large, we continue to invest in. That\u2019s another very prominent strategy that we\u2019ve got. So, we\u2019ve put a lot of additional thought and retooling into the teams throughout the Company, particularly through our operating teams and we\u2019re seeing very good results from that, too. So, great environment to continue to drive the business, and we\u2019re pleased by many of the things that are taking hold. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to circle back a little bit on the acquisitions outlook. And I know that you mentioned you haven\u2019t seen any changes in pricing so far that remains very competitive. But, just from your perspective, are you maybe holding back more than you otherwise might have on the expectation that pricing will change, or just kind of how do you see that playing out just because -- I mean, we know that interest rates are going up, right? I mean, that\u2019s been very clear. I\u2019m just wondering, it seems at some point, that has to start being reflected in what -- in seller expectations? Joe Russell : Yes. Smedes, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve holistically pivoted or taken a different approach to the way that we\u2019ve been investing. We continue to look for opportunities, just as I outlined relative to the quality of the assets that we\u2019re bringing to the portfolio, the opportunity that we can say from -- that we can see from driving returns, based on our performance and then putting them into our own platform, what kind of success factors we\u2019ll see from there, the additive scale that we\u2019re going to get in any particular market. So, because of some of the shifting that we\u2019re seeing, we haven\u2019t stepped back and said where we\u2019re going to be out of the market or we\u2019re going to shift down relative to our approach to betting and looking at assets that make sense to come into the portfolio. There\u2019s a fair amount of competitive activity. But believe me, the team is working hard. We\u2019re very busy underwriting assets. And there\u2019s a lot of competitive activity playing through. There\u2019s always a tipping point that we\u2019re very cognizant of where we feel an asset may or may not bring forth the relative returns best on a price that it may trade for us. So, we\u2019re going to be very reflective of that, too. But overall, we\u2019re still seeing opportunities. And we\u2019re very optimistic about what can continue to play through. As Tom mentioned, our balance sheet continues to be in very strong shape. We\u2019re sitting on $1 billion of cash. This year, we\u2019re likely to generate another $600 million to $700 million in free cash flow. So, very well positioned to continue to grow the portfolio and seeing very good asset opportunities, and we\u2019ll continue to vet them. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Todd Thomas : I just wanted to go back to occupancy for a second. The decrease in occupancy at quarter-end compared to the average appeared a little bit atypical for a first quarter. I know you\u2019re at sort of very-high occupancy rates, in general, but -- and I know the goal is to maximize revenue. But, are you seeing occupancy build up further from here at this point during the peak rental season, or are you seeing the occupancy side of the formula just a little bit more challenging to maintain? Tom Boyle : Sure. Well, I think, I\u2019d make a couple of points. I think one of the comments you made there was an important one, which is that we\u2019re seeking to maximize revenue from the available inventory that we have. And so, occupancy is a component, rental rate is a component. I\u2019ll tell you, occupancy down 80 basis points is a relatively small component of the overall revenue outlook as we think about the year. That said, clearly, we\u2019re managing our inventory. And I guess, maybe reading into your question, are you asking is occupancy lower because of weaker consumer trends. And I think to reiterate comments we\u2019ve made already on the call, we\u2019re not seeing weakening consumer trends. We\u2019re seeing good customer demand for space and then seeking to maximize the revenue that we can from the available inventory and that demand. So, I wouldn\u2019t highlight anything there. I would say, it\u2019s unusual to start the year with the level of occupancy that we had this year. And so, I think, your point is a fair one, which is it\u2019s a bit of a unique year, but that doesn\u2019t change our strategies as we head through the year. Todd Thomas : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, are there any indicators that give you a sense for maybe the level of vacates that you might anticipate if economic activity slows down from where it\u2019s at here in the quarters ahead? Is there any way to sort of gauge potential vacate activity across the portfolio? Tom Boyle : Yes. I mean, vacate activity is something that our teams watch very closely. So, you heard from Richard Craig and Philip Kim, on our team on Investor Day around the analytics and pricing methodologies. Part of those methodologies drive on available inventory. And to understand available inventory, you need to understand anticipated vacates and the level of inventory you have to market. So, that\u2019s a metric that I have teams internally looking at daily. And what I\u2019d say is, we have pretty good visibility into vacate levels. And if things start to shift in an unexpected manner, it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019d communicate. But to everything we\u2019ve highlighted to date, we\u2019re not seeing anything that is unusual as it\u2019s related to the predicted vacate activity through the year. I would say the only time we saw really big shifts in anticipated vacates versus what the actuals were was the onset of the pandemic. And that was obviously a pretty unique time period. But really since then, behavior has been pretty predictable. Operator : Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser Allaway : Thank you Most of my questions have been asked. I just had two maybe on the ancillary revenue side. There\u2019s been a lot of churn across the sector in terms of the third-party management pools. Can you guys maybe just speak to who is buying these assets? Is it any REIT peers, or is the buyer pool changed recently? Joe Russell : Yes. Spencer, it\u2019s any and all of the typical buyers that are out in the market. So, that\u2019s a pretty commonplace component of the third-party platforms, whether they\u2019re the platforms you see through the public operators, and there\u2019s a fair amount of private third-party management platforms as well. So, the trading activity that can take place within those platforms can come from either a public operator, private equity, private investors. So, it\u2019s pretty typical of just the overall range of buying activity that takes place. We\u2019ve -- typically, even before we got in the third-party management business, typically bought a fair amount of assets out of different third-party platforms. Last year that -- we also bought a number of assets out of our own third-party management platform. In the first quarter, we bought one. But, there is a fair amount of trading that goes on in these platforms, some of which is tied to structurally, the reasons many of these assets are on these platforms as they\u2019re being teed up to do just that. The owners may not look at their own ownership for long periods of time. They\u2019re looking for certain levels of optimization. They\u2019ll get the asset to that point, and they\u2019ll take back right out of the market to trade. So, very typical kind of the overall dynamics of what happens with third-party management. Spenser Allaway : Okay, great. Thank you. And then, can you give a sense of the penetration rates for tenant insurance, just maybe on the same-store pool as compared to your non-same-store pool? Tom Boyle : Sure. I\u2019m going to speak to coverage overall. Coverage in the same-store pool is in the upper 60s, and that\u2019s been pretty stable. It\u2019s maybe been increasing a little bit over the past couple of years. And in the non-same store, it\u2019s lower than that. And that\u2019s intuitive for development properties. It actually tends to punch a little bit higher than our same-store pool as we see a lot of new customers who find the value in our tenant insurance offering. And then for acquired properties, it takes a little bit longer to have that coverage reach a more stable basis as many tenants are coming in that are in place that maybe don\u2019t choose to utilize the offering. So overall, it tends to be lower. I think for the quarter, off the top of my head, it was in the 50s for coverage in the non-same-store pool versus that upper-60s in the same-store pool. And obviously, part of the strategy over the coming years will not only be to lease up that non-same-store pool, but also offer that product to that tenant base. Operator : Our next question will come from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : I was just wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit more on supply. Supply is often brought on demand is strong, and it seems like it is. And I think you\u2019ve previously said you didn\u2019t think it would be a real wind to \u201822 or \u201823. So, just wondering if you could give your current view on supply this year and next, and what macro factors may be impacting that, for example, construction costs versus storage-specific drivers, like good demand. Joe Russell : Sure, Caitlin. Yes. And I would tell you that as we\u2019ve spoken to over the last several quarters, some of the headwinds that seem to be containing the amount of volume of new development, we feel, is a good thing in one way, meaning there\u2019s elevated risk going in any development opportunity. And I can\u2019t name a city, for instance, nationally that is easier to deal with today than it was pre-pandemic. City staffs are constrained from a staffing standpoint, from a timing standpoint, the complexity to get through both entitlement and then construction processes are very elevated. And with that, there\u2019s more risk at hand, at a time when we\u2019re seeing component costs increase, in some cases, pretty dramatically, whether it\u2019s steel, labor, concrete. And then, with that interest rates are still far from stable. In fact, they\u2019re accelerating. So, very different risk factors that create some pretty meaningful headwinds. So, the development business is still active, however, I mean, still 500 to 600 properties likely to come into the market this year and next. To your point, obviously, some of that\u2019s being driven by the overall success of the sector and the amount of demand that we\u2019re seeing for self-storage, but there\u2019s a healthier level of discipline that\u2019s playing through for many of the factors that I spoke to. It\u2019s been a good window for our development team to continue to do what you\u2019re seeing us do, which is to grow our own pipeline. We\u2019re seeing less competitive activity for certain land sites in certain markets. We\u2019re able to capture opportunities because we\u2019ve got the scale, the efficiency and the opportunity deflect to some degree, some of the pressure points that I just spoke to. But if you\u2019re a first-time developer or a developer that doesn\u2019t have the wherewithal to potentially deal with these risk factors, you\u2019re probably going to be a lot more conservative and -- we think that overall, as I mentioned, that\u2019s a good thing for the industry. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. And then maybe also on the eRental platform. I know you talked earlier that it\u2019s continuing to grow. So, sorry if I missed the stat. Could you just go through what portion of your portfolio or incremental leasing this makes up where you see it going, but also what kind of impact that shift has on the bottom line? Like, are there any less employees or other expenses as a result of that? Joe Russell : Yes. So, we\u2019ve seen continued adoption of eRental. Now, over 50% of our customers are using that channel from an election standpoint. We\u2019re not pushing them to it, but they\u2019re actually electing to choose self-directed digital leasing process. By virtue of that, at our own frontlines and the amount of time that our property managers, in particular, historically would have spent on that specific move-in process when you\u2019re seeing the effects of potentially 50-plus-percent of that coming out of the labor demand property to property, it\u2019s pretty powerful. It gives us the opportunity to redirect priorities relative to the utility of the property management team, the things that they\u2019re focused on, the efficiencies that can play through when half or more of their customer activity is actually being self-directed and done on a digital basis. So, it\u2019s a pretty powerful tool. You\u2019re seeing some of that through the cost efficiency and our labor, even though labor costs are up, but there\u2019s continued benefit that we see from increasing the amount of digital options that we\u2019re giving customers. And frankly, we\u2019re getting very good feedback from customers who use that tool as well. It\u2019s a growing and preferred alternative to actually transact. It\u2019s a much more consistent experience, and it can give the customer even that much more flexibility when they choose to move in to a specific property. So, all things considered, it\u2019s been a very powerful tool, and we\u2019re continuing to look at different ways of utilizing it and expanding its use, again, depending on customer choices. Operator : Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Thanks for letting me get back in the queue. Just one question kind of tying back to a couple of previous ones. At the Investor Day last year, you talked about the longer-term goal of cutting 25% in payroll costs. So, just curious if you have an update on that. Clearly, inflation is a lot higher. This quarter, we saw R&M and centralized management costs on the same-store pull up in the high-teens. So, just if you can give us an update on how we should be thinking about that previous commentary in light of what\u2019s changed, obviously? Tom Boyle : Yes. So, just to put some financial guardrails around what Joe just highlighted from a strategy standpoint. We did highlight that we would anticipate to reduce hours by about 25% from 2019 levels at the Investor Day. And I\u2019d say, we\u2019re a good bit along that journey, but a little over halfway and continuing to find opportunities to drive that further. So, we\u2019re on track there and anticipate to get through to that 25% in the coming year or two. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : Yes. Hi. Curious, as you\u2019re ramping up your development spend, can you talk a little bit about your -- through land positions, and how many years\u2019 worth of starts that that could support? Joe Russell : Yes, Mike. What\u2019s typical in the way that we approach land is we\u2019re looking primarily for opportunities where we\u2019re not directly putting land inventory right onto our balance sheet. It\u2019s pretty typical or the types of opportunities that we\u2019re sourcing give us the flexibility as a buyer to actually take the site through layers or stages of entitlements that happen on their ownership time. It\u2019s the obligation they give us or the time we take to actually take the property through reentitlement without actually owning the site. So, contractually, that\u2019s a pretty typical approach. It\u2019s not each and every time, but more often than not, we\u2019re taking a land site through certain layers of entitlements before we actually take ownership to not only reduce risk but to contain costs as well. And with the amount of knowledge, efficiency and resources that we put into these processes, by far, the majority of the landowners that we\u2019re doing business with are agreeable to that kind of approach. So, with that, we\u2019re not holding large land positions. And with -- and more frequently, we\u2019re going to acquire a site when it\u2019s much more closer to the ability or the timing to actually start construction. Michael Mueller : Got it. So, I mean, if we\u2019re just thinking about those agreements in the same way that you would think about owning land, I guess, how many you\u2019re in the works -- or how many do you have? And what sort of lead time frame does that give you in terms of we have with what\u2019s under our control, two years worth of development three years or one year or something? I mean, how do you size that up? Joe Russell : Yes. Mike, I would say, it aligns exactly to the timing you\u2019re talking about. So, market-to-market, you\u2019ve got some processes that might take you a year or two. You\u2019ve got others that could take three or four. And believe it or not, some that could even be longer than that. So, we\u2019re matching that up. And contractually, we have control of the sites before we\u2019re starting to invest and deploy resources and time into those sites. So, we\u2019ve got control of the land sites themselves. So -- and it matches to exactly what you\u2019re speaking to. So, if you think about the pipeline that we have today, there are components of that pipeline that those land sites are going through the exact same sets of processes that I spoke to. So, we may not have actually acquired the land site itself in certain of those cases, but we have full contractual ability to control the site. And once we get through the entitlement process, we\u2019ll take ownership. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Katie, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Chelsea. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 5, 2022, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourselves to two questions. Of course, if you have an additional question, feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Tom and I will cover second quarter highlights as we achieved a number of record performance metrics and milestones. Now that we are past the midpoint of the year, we are happy to share our view of the next six months, which has resulted in our guidance raise. Before I go to those details, I would like to take a brief moment and acknowledge a significant milestone for Public Storage that takes place this month. On August 14, 1972, Public Storage was launched by two creative and determined entrepreneurs, Wayne Hughes and Ken Volk, opening the first Public Storage facility in El Cajon, California. The concept of paying to store stuff was new. But the simple name, a great location and roll up doors painted the color of orange created a powerful formula to grow the Company, so much so that our brand quickly became synonymous with the self-storage industry. Now five decades later, the Public Storage team and I are inspired to stay just as focused on entrepreneurial pursuits, expanding the iconic Public Storage brand and empowering the 5,500-plus dedicated employees that cater to our 1.7 million customers on a daily basis. We are appreciative of our shareholders, particularly those that have continued their commitment to Public Storage over our history, while knowing we have the right culture to ensure an equally bright future. Now to Q2 results. Business year-to-date remains quite good, with robust performance in both, our same-store and non-same-store portfolios. New customer demand through the typical summer leasing season has been exceptional as well as growing length of stay with existing customers. This, against the backdrop of muted new property deliveries in most markets. We have good pricing dynamics on both, move-ins and with existing customer rate increases, leading to the highest rent levels we have seen historically. Arguably, a number of the pandemic-related drivers to our business are receding, but we are pleased to see elevated levels of demand, new customer adoption and longevity of use. Customers, consumers and businesses alike are still in need of more space for a variety of reasons that include decreasing affordability of renting or owning a home, tight inventories of commercial space, hybrid work environments and the typical movement that takes place nationally this time of year. I would like to highlight a handful of particularly significant milestones or first in the quarter. We achieved $1 billion in revenue. Our average length of stay is now 39 months. Operating margins exceeded 80%. Our development pipeline has reached $1 billion and being named by Forbes as Best Place to Work by our employees. Now to acquisitions. By all accounts, 2021 was a historic year, and we were pleased to capture approximately 30% of the total sector volume. These 230 assets are performing well, in fact, above expectation with more growth ahead for the entire 525 properties in the non-same-store portfolio that is now over 50 million square feet. As we anticipated, 2022 acquisition volume has shifted down with fewer large portfolios entering the market. We are also getting more last calls from sellers and brokers with fewer buyers in the market. Cap rates have adjusted up and could move further. It\u2019s a different playing field, and we anticipate some interesting opportunities with over $1 billion in cash, a balance sheet prime for growth and a reputation as a preferred buyer. The self-storage sector and our own history point of resilience in times of economic change, including recessions of varying degrees. We too are looking for all ways to interpret any shift in customer demand and behavior. We are well positioned to compete for customers across all of our markets with the exceptional scale and product offerings in the 39 states we operate in. Our same-store and non-same-store assets are poised to deliver strong results through the second half of 2022, positioning us well for whatever may play through as we enter 2023. Our leadership team is well equipped to grow and deliver exceptional shareholder returns. Now Tom will share some financial highlights with you as well. Tom? Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $3.99 for the quarter, representing 26.7% growth over the second quarter of 2021. Our first half results represent a strong start to the year and an acceleration from 2021. Let\u2019s look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 15.9% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Growth was driven by rate once again with two factors leading to the continued strength : first, strong move-in rates that were up 12% versus 2021; and secondly, existing tenant rate increases contributing with a lengthening customer stay. Los Angeles was a particularly strong contributor accelerating from 12% same-store revenue growth in the first quarter to 17% in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate into the third. Moving down the P&L. Same-store cost of operations were up 7.6%, driven by growth in property payroll, utilities and marketing. Our strategic initiatives, including operating model efficiencies and LED and solar investments helped offset a portion of the wage and utility inflation. In total, net operating income with the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 18.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter. There is significant growth ahead from this pool of properties as well, which is a good segue to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Joe mentioned, we raised our outlook for the second half. In April, we provided our core FFO outlook with a $15.20 midpoint. The PSA business outlook improved by $0.37 or 2.4%. The improved outlook is driven by strong performance from our non-same-store pool of assets and to a lesser extent, ancillary growth and a reduction in interest expense. On net, our year-to-date performance has been in line with our expectations, but our outlook for the second half is improving. We did reflect the impact of the sale of PS Business Parks and a corresponding $0.22 impact resulting in a new midpoint of $15.35 per share of core FFO. And associated with the PSB sale, yesterday, we paid a $13.15 special dividend, returning capital to our shareholders. Overall, our capital and liquidity position remain strong, as Joe mentioned. We have a well laddered long-term debt profile and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. With $1 billion of cash on hand at quarter end and 3.7 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA we\u2019re well positioned to finance the growth initiatives ahead. With that, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, my first question, could we maybe discuss a little bit more, flesh out your comment on the outlook for the second half is improving, please? And how does that -- I guess, your thoughts then how -- heading into \u201823, how that impacts the setup into \u201823? Joe Russell : Yes. Jeff, Good morning. As Tom and I highlighted, we continue to be encouraged by the health of the business. You start with customer demand. Quite good. We\u2019re seeing top of the funnel demand that continues to encourage us that the adoption of self-storage is quite robust across our markets. The existing customer behavior has been consistent, and if anything, continues to encourage us relative to customers needing and using their space for longer periods of time. Our average length of stay now is 39 months. Compare that to about a year ago, and it was around 34 months, very encouraging. The things that I spoke to relative to muted deliveries across, again, the national market as a whole are also quite healthy, meaning that we\u2019re not seeing any particular market getting burdened by an unusual or heavy level of new supply. That\u2019s always a good thing for the business. And we\u2019re, again, measuring the changing dynamics that go with the 1.7 million customer base that we have. And we\u2019re really not seeing from a cohort standpoint, any change in behavior or elevated levels of stress by cohort. So that too is very encouraging. So, with all that said, coupled with the fact our same-store continues to perform quite well. And on an exceptional basis, our non-same store, as I mentioned, is very well poised to continue to deliver good results, not only through this second half of the year, but going into 2023. With all that said, Tom can give you a little bit of perspective on what we\u2019re thinking through the end of the year and what that positions us to do going into 2023? Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Joe. So, in particular, I\u2019ll highlight two elements as we think about where we\u2019ll play out through the second half and then go into 2023 and I\u2019ll hit on both the same-store as well as the non-same-store because I think they\u2019re both important. So, as we look at the same store, as you recall, we initiated a strong outlook for same-store illustrating or demonstrating acceleration from 2021 at the start of the year. And frankly, we\u2019re executing right along that path. So, the assumptions as we move into the second half on the same-store are pretty consistent and quite strong with modest deceleration into the second half given the tough comps that we have, particularly on rates, but also the typical seasonal occupancy pattern that we\u2019re expecting this year more so than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple. So, call it a 250 basis-point occupancy decline. So strong trends within the same store. And if you just look at what the first half performance is and the implied outlook for the second half, it implies an outlook or an exit level of revenue growth with low double digits on it, which is frankly not too dissimilar to where we started this year. So, a good outlook through the same-store in the second half and then I\u2019m expecting your question is leading to the 2023, which is also a good setup for 2023. On the non-same-store, as we\u2019ve highlighted now a number of times in our prepared remarks, continues to exceed our expectations. And so we did lift our outlook for the year in the non-same-store by $40 million. But importantly, that wasn\u2019t just a pull forward of stabilization activity. We actually raised our outlook of what those assets will stabilize with. And so there continues to be a strong outlook for growth in 2023 and beyond from that level of capital that we deployed to date. So, all encouraging trends as we look forward to 2023. Jeff Spector : Great. Thanks. Very helpful. And then my one follow-up. Joe, you commented on cap rates are up and we saw you at NAREIT, I think there\u2019s still somewhat limited information, but I\u2019d say this earnings season is still a key debate really across all sectors. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about your comment on cap rates? But I guess, most important on maybe asset values, like do you think -- where do you think storage asset values are today versus, let\u2019s say, six months ago? Joe Russell : Yes. Jeff, there\u2019s a few elements that go into that. So, as I mentioned, trading volumes definitely at a different place year-to-date than we were in 2021 at this time. As I mentioned, far fewer, if any of the big jumbo size hovering $1 billion or more portfolios, either come to the market or traded. So, the level of information that we\u2019re tracking relative to cap rate impact goes to the segment of the market that is much smaller, whether they\u2019re individual assets, smaller portfolios, and there\u2019s a range playing through depending on the asset quality, the stabilization of a particular asset, et cetera. But there\u2019s no question, as you would expect, as interest rates are behaving the way they are i.e., they\u2019re increasing and depending on what the Fed continues to do downstream, we\u2019ll see what additional impact we have relative to just interest rate levels themselves. Bidding activity plays through, meaning how aggressive or less aggressive our buyer is going to be for certain types of assets. So, we\u2019ll see how cap rates continue to trend, but our view is they\u2019ve elevated plus or minus, say, 50 basis points. They could trend a little bit higher. But again, it\u2019s going to be subject to the amount of capital that\u2019s still anxious to come into the sector. I mentioned our team is seeing what I would call more last calls. We think that\u2019s a good thing, meaning that -- at the end of the day, maybe some of the feverish buying activity that was in part of the market in 2021 is softened. That always gives us a different opportunity to engage with certain sellers relative to their need to actually do a transaction. As I mentioned, we are clearly looked upon as a very preferred buyer. We know typically the asset at hand quite well in many cases, maybe even better than the owner, may know either the submarket or the opportunity that might be tied to an asset. So, a lot of things that come into the mix that can affect cap rates. But as I mentioned, I think that too can be very healthy and particularly for a well-heeled and deep-seated buyer and knowledge a buyer like we are, that can be a very compelling time to engage with an owner. And we\u2019re seeing activity to that degree. So, we\u2019ll continue to pace and see what change plays through. But as you would expect with the change in interest rates alone, there\u2019s going to be some movement in cap rates. Operator : Our next questions will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : I wanted to dig into a comment that was made earlier about some of the properties in the non-same-store pool that are expecting to stabilize at a higher level. Can you provide a little bit more information on that? And then, I guess, related to that, how does that change your process of underwriting or acquiring your portfolio as your properties start to move higher, stabilize and stabilize at a higher level? Joe Russell : Yes. Mike, I\u2019ll start with a few things. First, if you think about the strategy that we\u2019ve deployed now for the last two years plus, we\u2019ve entered transactions with a priority around finding additional upside in any asset acquisition that we\u2019re either entertaining or bringing into the portfolio. So, of the $5.1 billion of asset acquisitions that we did in 2021, average occupancy hovered around 60% to 65%. So, by design, we\u2019ve been very focused on finding and taking assets that may be either at a state of fill-up or a state of optimization that clearly hasn\u2019t met either the owner\u2019s expectation or an optimization level that we feel that we can clearly achieve, once we own the asset. So, that has given us a very compelling opportunity to drive the types of returns that Tom spoke about that, in many cases, are even more elevated than we expected when we bought the assets. A couple of very simple examples, that\u2019s definitely playing through with the two bigger portfolios that we bought in 2021, the easy storage portfolio that we took down in April of last year, a $1.8 billion transaction, seeing very good lift relative to not only the results we expected in the first year, but we\u2019re even doing better than expectation. And then, the same thing is playing through with All Storage, the transaction that we did in the fourth quarter, again, another large portfolio. But the same type of trajectory is honestly playing through with the one-off and the much smaller portfolios as well. And part of that, again, by strategy and design, we\u2019ve been very focused on identifying assets that we can bring into the portfolio and drive much further optimization through not only fill-up of maturation of the existing revenue base, the customer base, et cetera. Tom, you can give a little bit of color, if you like to relative to some specifics. Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Joe. So Michael, I\u2019ll give you some of the financial components that we included in guidance that we\u2019re providing to in order to be able to model this a little bit easier. So, for the year, as part of our core FFO outlook, we\u2019re providing a non-same-store NOI contribution number. And in addition to that, there\u2019s a line item below core FFO that is the non-same-store NOI to stabilization, which will occur after 2022. And so you can think about adding those two numbers together to reach our view of stabilized NOI of that pool. And so, if you look back in April, our non-same-store NOI contribution for 2022 in our guidance was a midpoint of $450 million, and we included at the bottom of the page $180 million of incremental NOI to stabilization. So, if you add those two numbers together, you\u2019re going to get your $630 million of stabilized NOI. If you compare that to this quarter, we lifted our non-same-store outlook by $40 million at the midpoint. So, you\u2019re looking at a $490 million NOI contribution from the non-same-store pool in the calendar year 2022. But then we also retained that line item below at $172 million of incremental NOI to stabilization. So, if you add those two numbers together, the $490 million and the $172 million, you get to $662 million. So, in effect, we raised our outlook for ultimate stabilization by $32 million to $662 million. So, again, an improving outlook. The performance we\u2019re seeing this year is not just a pull forward of stabilization. It\u2019s also outperformance and outperformance versus expectations. Joe Russell : And Mike, one other thing I\u2019d add, we haven\u2019t spoken to the performance of our development assets. And those two not only continue to drive very good returns, but are beating expectations relative to, again, level of lease-up, the performance of the asset. We clearly have very unique advantage being the only public developer of the product in the space and by far, the largest developer in the sector. The team is doing a very nice job identifying prime land sites, using many of the data elements that we uniquely have to find pockets of opportunities, whether they\u2019re markets that are more mature and/or growing markets, and those assets to continue to drive very good returns. As I noted, our development pipeline for the first time hit $1 billion. We\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019ve got a nice window to continue to find compelling opportunities, and we\u2019ll continue to allocate capital in that arena as well, which has been very fruitful. Michael Goldsmith : That\u2019s very helpful. And then, as a follow-up, the non-same-store pool outperformed the expectations. The same-store pool has been in line with your expectations. As we look ahead, how much of a non-same-store portfolio is -- through the same store pool in 2023 as we think of kind of the maturation of these stabilized assets? Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Michael. So, the first thing I\u2019d highlight is, as we think about adding properties to our same-store pool, we\u2019re focused on adding them when they\u2019re stabilized. And so, as I just walked through, there\u2019s meaningful NOI contribution to come from those assets before they reach stabilization in the coming years. And so, we won\u2019t add those into the same-store pool until they\u2019ve reached that stabilized level. And so, there will be some properties added. But as we just demonstrated, there\u2019s significant growth ahead that will sit in the non-same-store versus the same-store pool as we move into 2023. And we\u2019ll continue to provide the level of disclosure that we do today by acquisition and development vintage, so that you can see and track that performance over time. Operator : Our next questions will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Just going back to your comments about any kind of consumer trends that you might be seeing. Are there any discernible trends between maybe weaker demographic type of customers when they get a rent increase letter versus higher income customers, or are they all kind of responding in a similar fashion? Tom Boyle : Sure. So specifically around rent increases, I\u2019ll hit that and then maybe I\u2019ll take a step back as well and talk about overall customer trends as I think that may be instructive. The existing tenant rate increase program is something that obviously has been running for a very long time, but it\u2019s an area we continue to make investments in and it\u2019s really driven by extensive testing. Joe mentioned we have over 1.7 million customers today. We send over 1 million rent increases a year, and that gives us the ability to dynamically manage that program and frankly, use data science today in a way that we couldn\u2019t use in years past. And so that program continues to improve, and ultimately, we continue to see the benefit of that program in our realized rents. In terms of customer reaction, that\u2019s a really important part of the program is to understand what we predict the customer behavior to be, and we\u2019re constantly tuning and understanding if there\u2019s any shifts in ultimate behavior. And I\u2019d say year-to-date is, in fact, customers are behaving as good or better, frankly, than what our models have been predicting for them as we move through the year. So continue to see good behavior from our customers. And as Joe mentioned, the length of stay continues to extend, which is a really favorable trend for that program as there are more customers to send increases too. So, that all played out well. And then, I think your second question around or the second component that I want to focus on is around demographics. And are we seeing any shifts in customer behavior by demographics, even away from that data-driven existing tenant approach? And the short answer is we\u2019re not really seeing anything across the customer base and continue to see broad-based strength. There are a few operating metrics that if you look at them versus last year, they\u2019re deteriorating. So, things like move-outs, right, that move-outs are higher for us and I think across the sector, but they\u2019re off incredibly low bases and still well below pre-pandemic levels. You could say the same thing around delinquency, et cetera. But as you slice and dice that by demography or other customer segments, nothing there that\u2019s percolating that we\u2019d highlight as being concerning, frankly, overall continued broad-based strength around the customer base. Ki Bin Kim : And on the same topic on ECRI, can you just describe high level, what types of increases you\u2019re pushing out there? And maybe the frequency? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, what we\u2019ve highlighted in the past is the magnitude and frequency of our increases are really driven by two components. One is what do we anticipate the reaction to be to the increase. And as I just spoke to, that performance has been as good or better than our expectations and, frankly, better than history. And the second component is an optimization based on if the customer moves out, what\u2019s the cost to replace that tenant. And in both instances versus pre-pandemic levels, they\u2019re both pointing to higher magnitude and frequency of increase. And so, if in the past, we were sending 8% to 10% increases to our longer term tenants, we\u2019re sending higher increases today and higher frequency. Operator : Our next question will come from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald, your line is now open. Ronald, are you by chance muted? Tom Boyle : Why don\u2019t we go to the next question, and we can let Ron jump back in queue. Operator : All right. Next, we\u2019ll take Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I guess I just wanted to circle up. Your first half results were obviously very strong, up 19.5%. I know you didn\u2019t change guidance, but I guess, to hit the low end of the range on NOI, you need to be like at 7% in the back half of the year. And just given the commentary that you\u2019ve talked about, it seems highly unlikely even with tough comps. So I guess what are we missing at the low end or is it just pretty clear that you\u2019re sort of at the midpoint, the high end at this point, but you\u2019re still sort of in that range? And just sort of the low end just seems very unfavorable. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. I guess, what I\u2019d characterize is obviously, we\u2019re not going to change the outlook here on the call. But what I\u2019d say is when we set the outlook at the beginning of the year and we continue to reaffirm it is we wanted to set a wider range to encapsulate a broader range of outcomes. That\u2019s both on the high end as well as the low end, given the uncertainty of a month-to-month lease business and frankly, how dynamic the industry has performed over the last several years. And so, we did set a broad range. And as we move through the second half, there\u2019s still a reasonable range of outcomes that could play out in the environment. And so, we didn\u2019t touch the range. But to your point, the first half has been strong and frankly, right on our expectations. And so -- and to all the points around customer demand trends and the like, things are set up well as we head into the second half, but we do face some pretty tough comps, both on rents as well as occupancies moving into the second half. And I\u2019d say similarly on expenses, right? We saw expense growth accelerating into the second quarter. We left our same-store expense positioned at the same level as the start of the year. And we are seeing inflationary pressures. We have multiple initiatives to mitigate the impact of some of the inflationary pressure. But there\u2019s no question the labor market is tight and you don\u2019t have to look any further than the jobs number that came out this morning to indicate how tight the labor market is in this environment. And so we want to make sure we\u2019re encapsulating the outcomes there on expenses as well. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then, a follow-up, Joe, you guys left the acquisition guidance unchanged at $1 billion. If you include sort of -- you closed or going to close to quarter end, you\u2019re about $0.5 billion. So, maybe just talk a little bit about the pipeline. I know you\u2019re certainly seeing more opportunities and given your balance sheet, I\u2019m just wondering, given that you can be an all-cash buyer, do you actually expect volumes to accelerate even if there\u2019s less product on the market? Joe Russell : Yes. That\u2019s going to be subject, Steve, on a number of factors. As far as the $1 billion target or guidance for 2022, to your point, we\u2019re tracking well to that level of volume. What\u2019s typical is this time of year, you\u2019re going to see even an unpredictable amount of potential volume coming to the market, knowing that the market is different from a predictability standpoint this year than last year because of the range of big portfolio opportunities being quite limited if in fact at all. Very, very different outlook, as I mentioned. We\u2019re going to continue to look for a whole range of opportunities. As I mentioned, we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019re very well set to engage and unlock anything that would be particularly compelling. It will just depend on, again, what\u2019s going to play through, particularly in the next, say, 3 to 4 months. And with that, we\u2019ll see what kind of opportunities arise. The things that we continue to look for, as I mentioned, are assets that we are clearly seeing upside opportunity from a value creation standpoint. That\u2019s clearly part of the set of asset acquisitions that have been completed or that are pending as we guided to, and we\u2019ll continue to look for those and other types of opportunities as well. So, this -- as Tom mentioned, there\u2019s some shifting things out there relative to different pressure points that could play through with different owners and that could be an interesting opportunity for us as well. So, very excited about that. And the team is working hard. We\u2019re highly engaged across multiple markets, and we\u2019ll continue to see what additional volumes play through by virtue of that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go back now to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. All right. We\u2019ll move on to Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Can you talk a little bit about the potential for a dividend increase? It looks like it hasn\u2019t been raised since about the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth has been good. It looks like you\u2019re looking at fewer big deals where you can accelerate expenses. And now you have the PSB dilution on it. It just feels like you have to be getting pretty darn close to being forced to raise it. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Mike. So, the first thing I\u2019d highlight is we did just send a big distribution out to our shareholders yesterday, $13.15. But as it relates to the regular dividend, to your point, the dividend has been relatively consistent for some time or has been consistent since the fourth quarter of 2016. And one of the drivers of that, and we\u2019ve talked about this in the past is some tax law changes in 2017 that introduced bonus depreciation in effect lowering our taxable income for that intervening period. And to your point, cash flow growth and taxable income growth has been strong, which has been increasing taxable income. As we move into 2023, though, the notable element is that bonus depreciation will begin to phase out. And that benefit that we\u2019ve received over the last several years in terms of lowering our taxable income will go away, and that will allow us to increase our dividend and ultimately return more capital to shareholders in the coming years as we go, while at the same time, retaining a significant amount of retained cash flow to reinvest in the business. And so, to your point around, it\u2019s been some time and growth has been strong. It\u2019s that as well as taxable income increasing that is likely to increase our dividend over time here as we move forward. And that\u2019s something that we highlighted at Investor Day as well as taxable income increases. We\u2019ll be poised to increase the current return to our shareholders. And that is, as we move forward into 2023, something that will begin to be more of a topic. Mike Mueller : Got it. Appreciate it. And then just a quick follow-up. With the development pipeline now at $1 billion, what\u2019s your average annual development spend run rate at that level? Tom Boyle : Well, right now, obviously, we\u2019re increasing the level of the development pipeline. So, that\u2019s going to come with it increased annual spend. But as you think about like the cadence this year, for instance, we\u2019re going to deliver about $250 million of developments this year, but we probably spend $400 million or so, which implies increased deliveries for next year, and that\u2019s going to continue to move higher. So, the spend next year is probably $450 million to $500 million, which will lead to increased deliveries then as we get into 2024. All on pace to reach the objective that we outlined at Investor Day of $700 million in annual deliveries and annual spend by 2026. Operator : Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser Allaway : Maybe just stepping back from operations. I just had a question on the CapEx front. So, I understand that the commodity like sector CapEx isn\u2019t as crucial as in other sectors. But just wanted to get your thoughts on how important it is to reinvest in the properties just to preserve competitive positioning, given the inevitability of supply ways in the space? Joe Russell : Yes. Sure, Spenser. Clearly, that\u2019s one of the compelling parts of the whole self-storage model is, frankly, if you design an asset and locate it well, the enduring and lack of obsolescence tied to the product is quite significant. So, we have assets now in our 50 years of history in many markets that were developed 40-plus years ago that are just as functional and desirable to users today as they were when they were initially built and have not required much annual and/or consistent level of additional capital. It ties to the simplicity of the product. One of the things that we\u2019ve been speaking to strategically over the last couple of years is holistically, we are stepping back in putting many of the attributes of our latest generation development products into our existing assets. That\u2019s called the Property of Tomorrow program. So this year, we will spend about $300 million or so into that program. We\u2019re about halfway through the portfolio. We\u2019ve got another three-plus years to finish that up. The thing that that\u2019s resetting is lifting again, not only brand, but by necessity property, property, any additional functionality or attributes that we feel are even that much more compelling to add to a particular asset. So, that too is something that we\u2019re intentionally doing and getting a nice set of reactions from existing new customers or employees, et cetera. So, that continues to be an ongoing investment that you\u2019ll see us make again in the coming years. Another component that we\u2019re early into is our adoption of solar across hundreds of properties as we speak. The goal is to at least put solar on half of the portfolio or more in the next two to three years. So that, too, is a very intentional and efficiency-related, environmentally-related investment that is playing well. We\u2019re just finishing up LED lighting. That\u2019s a project that started actually five-plus years ago. As you can imagine, a lot of real estate to touch, but we\u2019ve now relet to LED, the entire exterior of all of our assets and are just finishing up interior LED as well, good efficiency, energy conservation. And again, another nice attribute adding to the properties themselves. So, it\u2019s more akin to that. And again, if you step back and think about great location, functional design and the enduring value of the asset itself, it can play through very, very effectively with little, again, traditional CapEx spend compared to any type of other sector. Operator : Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just wanted to ask about California and New Jersey, the two markets that have had rent restrictions that have fairly recently come off and how you are in those two markets relative to the current market with your existing portfolio, and how much have you been able to drive rate and close that gap to the current market rate? And if you could just remind us on the contributions to same-store revenue growth as a result of those restrictions lifting? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, the first thing I\u2019d say is I\u2019d segment the two markets you just spoke to. So, I\u2019m going to go into a little bit more detail around California. New Jersey does have pricing restrictions upon state of emergency similar to California and a similar price cap. But that state of emergency was in place for a much shorter duration time period. So, it was in place for a little over a year or so, which certainly has an impact on revenues but nowhere near the multiyear impact that we experienced in Los Angeles County, in particular. So, the overall impact to our properties in New Jersey was more modest. So, shifting gears to Los Angeles County, in particular, I\u2019d say the same story is in place as it relates to the difference between San Francisco and Los Angeles. San Francisco had some state of emergencies that were declared particularly around COVID that again, were in place for a little over a year, but nowhere near the impact to Los Angeles County. So getting to Los Angeles, the state of emergency was in place from the fall of 2018 through the very beginning of this year. And so, that 10% price limitation was more significant to our overall revenues and it will take a little bit longer to recoup that. But as I noted earlier, we are seeing strong acceleration within Los Angeles. And if you look at the differential, for instance, between how Los Angeles County has performed compared to Orange County or San Bernardino or Riverside counties all in the same, obviously, metropolitan area. I\u2019d say we\u2019re just getting to a point where Los Angeles County is on par on a revenue growth basis with those markets, which indicates that we have still a good bit of revenue growth to go and recapture. And obviously, the team is executing on that to date. This year, we compartmentalize the Los Angeles County contribution to same-store revenue growth is being an incremental 1.5% to 2% of same-store revenue growth. And I\u2019d say, as we get into 2023, you\u2019re going to hear us talk about this again because there will be incremental benefit still as we move into to 2023, given the accelerating performance there. Juan Sanabria : Great. And could you just talk a little bit about, given your history and how much data you have about how you would expect the portfolio to perform maybe on a same-store revenue or NOI perspective, if we do get in fact, a recession, assuming it\u2019s not as bad as the financial crisis, but more of a \u201crun-of-the-mill recession\u201d. What would you expect the business to be able to do in the face of that kind of external pressure? Tom Boyle : Well, I think one of the key clarification points, Juan, is no recession is the same as another. So, I\u2019m not sure we can categorize what a typical recession would look like. But just looking back over time, what we\u2019ve seen is same-store revenues that dip into negative growth territory and same-store NOIs that dip into the kind of the mid to high single digits depending on the severity of the recession. But ultimately, it\u2019s going to depend on the nature and what the drivers are of that recession. Certainly, we\u2019re going into what could be a recession here. There\u2019s lots of headlines around potential recessions, but we haven\u2019t seen any impact to our business to date that would indicate that there\u2019s been a sharp move or otherwise, as we\u2019ve spoken to. So, hypothesizing what could play out, I think looking back at previous recessions and those kind of low to mid-single-digit same-store revenue impacts and mid to high-single-digit NOI impact is probably the best guide. But again, we\u2019ll see as we get there. Joe Russell : Yes. And I think just to put a little bit more color on some of the dynamics and the multi dimensions, which frankly makes storage that much more compelling, even in a recessionary environment, there\u2019s definitely history that points to storage continues to be an extension of home. As I mentioned, if home affordability is a pressure point, storage benefits by that. Supply has been very muted. So, if there were recessionary pressures out there, but we\u2019re not dealing with the same level of supply that may have coming on in certain other recessionary environments that could be a very different dynamic. The employment picture is very fluid as we speak, as Tom mentioned, very strong numbers came out today. So even with some commentary that how could we be going into a recession with such strong employment data. So, a lot of different crosscurrents. We have a month-to-month business. We have a very nimble business. We can calibrate around demand and pricing factors that will serve us well. And we\u2019re continuing to operate the business at very high efficiency from a cost standpoint. As I mentioned, our margins are now over 80%. So again, very good components for us to continue to maneuver whatever could play through recessionary or otherwise. Operator : Our next question will come from Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Keegan Carl : Just a little bit more color on your third-party management platform. Maybe how is demand shaping up? And regarding a potential slowdown in construction and new supply, I mean, how do you tend to think of the long-term growth prospects? Joe Russell : Yes, sure. Third-party management pipeline continues to build. We added 12 assets to the platform this last quarter, our backlog continues to build as it has and has -- and as the third-party management as a whole has grown through additional development. So, some of this is time-oriented. So, we\u2019ll continue to build the size of the platform as some of these newer assets are actually delivered. We\u2019re building also on top of that some different and new relationships. It has been and will continue to be an opportunity for us to source likely acquisitions through those relationships. So, we\u2019re pleased by the trajectory and the growth that continues to come through our third-party management platform. Getting very good feedback from existing customers, many of whom are actually bringing us additional properties as we speak. As far as supply, again, there\u2019s a number of factors that have been I would call it beneficial and have put somewhat of a lid on supply accelerating. That includes more complications tied to just approvals themselves. I\u2019ve talked about this for the last few quarters. We\u2019re nationally building in many markets, and I can\u2019t name one that it\u2019s easier and more efficient today than it was either pre-pandemic or even historically. So very complicated sets of hurdles that you go through, unexpected time delays, et cetera. Then on top of that, clearly, in an inflationary time frame, we\u2019re looking at more pressure on that front. Many of the developers that are out in the market may not have the financial wherewithal to actually absorb some of those type of cost increases that may either delay or actually decide not to build. And then, on top of it, interest rate levels. Construction loans are more expensive, access to lending may be more complicated. So, all those things are actually putting through more discipline and keeping somewhat of a lid on the amount of additional development coming through. So, we see that, as I mentioned, as a very healthy thing. And it\u2019s a good window for us to come in and compete very differently. More often than not, we\u2019re not seeing as many bids on certain land sites, and we\u2019re also seeing some land owners come to us that have either taken a site through percentage of its entitlement process or maybe holistically and still want to actually do a land trade instead of actually doing the development themselves. Keegan Carl : Got it. And apologies if I missed this earlier, but did you guys disclose what percentage of your portfolio is currently\u2026 Tom Boyle : Keegan, that\u2019s not something that we disclose. We do disclose a healthy amount of information around move-in and move-out trends as well as the rates compared to in-place levels. What I would characterize, and I think what you\u2019re getting to is what could be the rent roll-up opportunity or otherwise? And maybe take a step back and self-storage is a little bit different than other property types in terms of how we manage revenue and how leases operate. So, as you think about managing revenue across the tenant base, one of the great aspects of self-storage is month-to-month leases. So, the team is focused not only on moving and signing new leases, but also managing the revenue on the entire existing population as well. And so, what you see historically, and you saw it again in this quarter, is that you can see a rent rolled out, which may sound a little bit odd for other property types, but to reiterate for self-storage that is -- that\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re successfully managing the existing tenants that are in-house. And as we spoke earlier, length of stays have been growing, which gives us more ability to do that and to send increases to our existing customers and ultimately tune that based on a data-driven approach. So again, this quarter and as we sit here today, our in-place rents are a good bit above where our move-in rents are and our move-out rents are also above where our move-in rents are, but that\u2019s healthy. And we anticipate that to continue through the rest of the year. Operator : Next, we have Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Hopefully, you can hear me. Third time\u2019s a charm. Ryan Burke : Yes. Third time\u2019s a charm. Ronald Kamdem : Quick one. It\u2019s definitely user error. So, two quick ones on my end. One is just when you\u2019re taking a step back sort of big picture, the portfolio is at record rents, sort of record pricing power, just this cycle operationally, is there anything you sort of try to do differently to try to measure the customer\u2019s pricing power, whether it\u2019s look at rent-to-income ratios or other than just move-out activity, which you monitor, is there any sort of different way to leverage all the data that you have to get at sort of the pricing power at the sort of unprecedented levels. Tom Boyle : Sure. So, I think there\u2019s a couple of things here. One is, as you think about rent-to-income levels or otherwise, those are kind of macro trends that we do look at periodically, we look and see what housing affordability is by different markets as we look forward. But frankly, that\u2019s not how we manage the business on a day-to-day basis. And the way we manage it day-to-day is much more driven on testing. And we have the ability to segment our customers and conduct continuous price testing, both for new customers as well as existing customers in terms of what we expect that elasticity to be. And overall, we\u2019re just speaking about with Keegan, price elasticity is more acute for new tenants than it is for existing tenants, which is ultimately why existing tenants will pay a higher price than new tenants moving in. And that\u2019s continuous testing across the platform for both sets of tenants to understand that elasticity by market, by unit type and that\u2019s managed dynamically. So, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing today compared to what we\u2019ve seen in the past, is continued -- or a continuation of that, which is, yes, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s price sensitivity for new customers today, and that\u2019s built in how we price our units on a day-to-day basis. That said, our move-in rents in the quarter were up 12%. And so, we continue to have an ability to increase rent in the face of that elasticity. And in July, move-in rents were up 8%. So, we are seeing moderation but continued strength in move-in rents. So nothing that I\u2019d highlight that is overly concerning from the micro. And I think from the macro standpoint, one of the key elements in self-storage is it\u2019s a nominal spend versus a consumer\u2019s income. And I think that continues to benefit the sector as we see rents resetting at all-time highs. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then, just following up on the questions on sort of the second half growth, the implied guidance on same-store revenue is 11.1%. And if we think about that as sort of a good run rate for the end of this year going into next year, is there anything, we\u2019re trying to figure out what the potential deceleration is going to be? Is there anything in terms of comp, customer behavior as we\u2019re -- again, as we\u2019re rolling into next year to think about sort of that growth function? Tom Boyle : Yes. I think, we\u2019ll give you a view on how 2023 is going to play out as we move into next year. But, I think you hit it right, which is a strong second half setting us up well for 2023. But in terms of the cadence of 2023, we\u2019ll maybe save that in terms of when we have more visibility. Operator : I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Chelsea, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Have a great weekend. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. And we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Katie. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, November 2, 2022, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, after that, feel free to jump in with further questions and follow-ups. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I will highlight our view of 2022 as we head into the last two months of the year, and then Tom will cover more specifics in the quarter. At the beginning of this year, our expectation was we were poised for exceptional earnings growth, which has clearly played through. With that, we raised our outlook on strong NOI performance in same-store and non-same-store assets, along with continued improvement in ancillary revenue. In total, core FFO is set to grow by over 20% for the second consecutive year. Looking back on both 2021 and now 2022, we have been particularly advantaged by a number of enduring demand factors that continue to drive historic performance. Customers are drawn to use self-storage even in an environment where some top line drivers are decelerating, such as home sales and market-to-market migration levels. The appeal and rationale to use storage is still tied to a sensible financial and need-based decision, where the cost of shelter, whether you own a rent, has increased dramatically. In addition, our customer survey data points to needing more space at home as the second and elevated driver to use storage. Hybrid work environments, for instance, are proving to be sustainable -- to be a sustainable reason for additional need for storage. For our business customers, renting a storage unit is a compelling alternative to taking down more expensive, less flexible industrial space. As demand has remained very good, existing customers, too, are staying longer, giving us the ability to optimize rate increases and occupancy. On a macro basis, new supply of competitive product has been flat to down from peak deliveries in 2019. Nationally, markets have been able to absorb the more subdued pace of new development. Our view is that new development will also be static for the near term as risk levels tied to development have increased, particularly due to city approval time frames, higher component costs and the dramatic increases in the cost of construction lending. With this said, it has become harder to predict the economic environment we are heading into with record inflation and consensus that the recession is imminent. We are, however, highly confident we have excellent tools to maneuver changing macro conditions. These include the industry-leading 200 million square foot portfolio of well-located assets in every large scale market nationally, the most recognized brand in the self-storage industry, cost-efficient online marketing prowess to guide new customers to our platform. A broad and growing base of digital channels to source new customers while improving customer and employee satisfaction, historically high operating margins now above 80% and operational efficiency, a massive non-same-store portfolio which continues to grow through acquisitions and development that is now 50 million square feet with excellent earnings power with over $150 million of additional NOI to come, a well-primed low leverage and low-risk balance sheet with $900 million of cash and no debt expirations through 2023, and finally the most experienced team in the self-storage sector. Now I'll hand the call over to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $4.13 for the quarter, representing 20.8% growth over the third quarter of 2021. Let's look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 14.7%. And breaking down the components, realized rents per occupied square foot were up a strong 17.2% matching last quarter's performance. Weighted average occupancy declined 2.4%. The moderation in occupancy from June to September represented a return to typical pre-pandemic seasonal occupancy decline of 150 basis points. The strong 14.7% growth moderated slightly from last quarter's 15.9% growth as expected. That said, Los Angeles was again a particularly strong contributor, accelerating from 17% same-store revenue growth in the second quarter to 20% in the third quarter. Now on to expenses. Same-store direct cost of operations were up 7.8% in the quarter. We increased our marketing spend in the quarter compared to last year when we were largely quiet in most of our markets, and we saw good returns on those ad dollar spend. Our strategic initiatives, including operating model transformation resulting from digital investments and LED and solar investments, helped offset a portion of the wage and utility inflation. And I note the recent Inflation Reduction Act added incentives for further solar investments as we ramp our own activity to reach over 1,000 properties with solar on our roots in the coming years. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool was up 17% for the quarter. In addition to the same store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired or developed facilities was once again strong, contributing $139 million in NOI for the quarter, up 68%. There is significant growth ahead from this pool of properties, as Joe noted, which is a good segue to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Joe mentioned, we raised our core FFO outlook for the year by $0.20 at the midpoint or 1.3% to $15.55 from our most recent outlook. The improved outlook is driven by better-than-expected performance in our same-store pool, continued strong growth from our non-same-store pool as well as our tenant insurance business. And shifting gears now to our balance sheet. Our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. We have a well-laddered long-term debt profile with limited floating rate exposure and over $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. Our leverage of 3.3x net debt and preferred to EBITDA, combined with $900 million of cash on hand at quarter end, puts us in a very strong position heading into 2023. It's our strategy to position ourselves for strong access and cost of capital to invest through cycles. Over the past couple of years, we've had the opportunity to use that balance sheet to grow, and we're ready to do it again. And with that, turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Goldsmith : Last year, realized rent growth and same-store rent growth accelerated through the year and then heading into 2022. Perhaps the expectation is that it was going to decelerate similar to the acceleration. Instead, it's remained very strong. So given these moving pieces and what we're seeing is a start to return to normal seasonality, how do we -- how should we think about the cadence or trajectory of rent growth and same-store revenue growth going forward? Tom Boyle : Sure. Good question, Michael. And I think you highlighted some of the moving pieces there well. As we came into the year, we were expecting continued strong rate momentum and have been pretty consistent around that, and we've seen that through the first part of the year paired with more typical seasonal behavior and the occupancy rises and falls that we in the industry see year in and year out with maybe the exception of the last couple. On the rate growth side, it's really been driven by two factors. One is really strong move-in rent growth over the last several years. And we've spoken in the past around some of our strongest markets like Miami and, now for us, Los Angeles as well with rent restrictions no longer in place. And that's been a really additive driver. Miami, quarter-to-date move-in rents were up 9%, again, on top of significant growth in prior years. The other side of that is then the existing tenant base, and Joe spoke earlier to the behavior of our existing tenants in the long length of stays that we've experienced over the last several years, and we're sitting now at record length of stays within the portfolio. And that's allowed us to send more rental rate increases because there's more long-term tenants and at higher magnitude because of the overall rent environment, which has led to increased realized rents. This quarter matched last quarter. We have been expecting a moderation through the back half of this year and would anticipate that, that plays through in the fourth quarter and is clearly embedded in our guidance, but year-to-date, we've been able to take advantage of that environment and have achieved strong rental rate growth throughout. Michael Goldsmith : I guess just as a follow-up to that is just given these factors that we have visibility into and combined with street rate growth, which is flattish to down, let's say, like how long do you have visibility into kind of continued elevated realized rent growth just based on these factors and not like some of the other things like with a worsening of or any potential worsening of street rates or any of that? Just like how long do you have visibility into elevated rent growth? Tom Boyle : I get it. You're asking about 2023 now. So looking at what we're experiencing on moving rent growth, we have seen the moderation in moving rent growth as we move through the year that we've been anticipating and speaking to move-in rent growth. And frankly, move-ins were quite strong in the quarter. We had move-in volumes were up 9%, move-in rates were up 3%, but that 3% is clearly a moderation from where we were earlier in the year and would anticipate that to continue to moderate through the fourth quarter. But as we look forward from here, our guidance would imply that we will exit the year with revenue growing at, call it, 10%, plus or minus, which sets us up really well heading into 2023, recognizing it could be an uncertain environment into 2023, we'll be starting from a period of strength, and so that's what I'd point you to. Michael Goldsmith : That's helpful. And just expenses have been elevated. You have several initiatives to offset the pressure, such as technology to reduce store hours or solar, also utility costs. Still, the gap between the same-store revenue growth and same-store expense growth is narrowing. So how should we think about the gap here? And can they converge if revenue growth moderates and expense growth kind of remains elevated or even accelerate? Tom Boyle : Yes. As revenue growth decelerates, we could see a narrowing of that. I'd say we have tools, and you highlighted some of them from an initiative standpoint that have been frankly underway for a number of years to help mitigate some of the pressures there. And heading into 2023, the team will be acutely focused on managing expenses in what's a tough environment. So I'm not sure I'd have much to add to that. Operator : Our next question will come from Lizzy Doykan with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Lizzy Doykan : I just wanted to ask about how that debt trended through the quarter, if, you could just give any color around the level of delinquent payments kind of if that picked up at all or just anything different from the prior quarter. Joe Russell : Sure. Lizzy, the behavior of our customer base even from a delinquency standpoint, I think, is a can to the elevated and consistent behavior we're seeing from a length of stay. And what I mean by that is the customer base as a whole continues to operate from a delinquency standpoint at nearly historically low levels. It's elevated up somewhat from where we were, say, a year ago, but nowhere close to what we saw pre-pandemic or what you would consider typical environment. Consumer balance sheets statistically appear to be in decent, if not surprisingly good shape going into 2023. We're seeing this in a number of different reports that we track relative to some of the banking platforms and other tracking mechanisms tied to the overall health of the consumer. And from an unemployment standpoint, we're clearly also seeing very little disruption, in fact, surprisingly good traction relative to overall employment levels. And then holistically, that still just ties back to one of my opening comments, which from a financial and need-based standpoint, storage continues to be a very necessary source of either relief or needing more space or other reasons that consumers continue to value and pay for on a much more consistent base, their storage storage units. So overall, a very close eye up, but nothing alarming by any means. Lizzy Doykan : Okay. Helpful color. And for my second question, I wanted to get more commentary around market performance. So particularly with new move-in rate increases since we were seeing that growth moderate. Are there specific markets where you've had to back off on rate increases for new move-in more so than others? And if you could comment on why the acceleration we've seen in L.A.'s market and how that's expected to trend going forward, that would be helpful. Joe Russell : Yes, I'll start, and then Tom can give you a little bit more color on some of the specific markets. You mentioned L.A., for instance, very strong growth in that market, and we think that serves us well going into 2023. It's clearly our largest market, and we've been held back now for some period of time, i.e., over three years, but we see very good continued rate growth and momentum in that market as we speak. Florida as a whole continues to be still quite strong. We're seeing very good inherent drivers and good absorption of not only move-in rates, but existing customer rate increases as well. And then from an overall standpoint, as I mentioned, we're seeing pretty muted new deliveries. So that, too, has not been an overarching pain point literally in any of the markets that we operate in. That's a very good thing. It's been a good thing for the sector for the last couple of years, and we don't see that changing in any material fashion going into 2023, and frankly, keeping a close eye in 2024, but not an elevated concern there either. Tom, you can give a little bit more color on some of the trends, otherwise that we're seeing in specific markets. Tom Boyle : Yes. And I'd say, overall, trends we're seeing in move-in rate generally link up to the markets that are performing the best overall from a revenue standpoint. So I already highlighted Miami, which continues to be a strong market. It's not seeing move-in rent growth of 25% or 30% a year, any longer but is up 9% in the quarter, one of our stronger markets. And as you'd anticipate, Los Angeles in a similar ZIP code there. In terms of markets that that have seen slower rent growth, again, very consistent with overall performance. I'd highlight San Francisco and New York that while positive on a move-in rent growth year-over-year is a more modest level of growth, call it, low single digits. Operator : Our next question will come from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is now open. Samir Khanal : Tom, you guys have done a great job on the expense side. Maybe help us understand how you've been able to sort of keep a lid on expense growth or better manage expenses when many companies are raising expense growth guidance probably across the REIT sector. I guess how much of this is sustainable into next year, your ability to sort of control expense or manage expense? Joe Russell : Yes, Samir. I'll give you a couple of general comments. And again, Tom can add more context. But it goes back to a number of very intentional investments that we've made year by year, many of which have been digitally-oriented. It's helped us optimize the amount of labor hours, for instance, our second highest expense costs in the P&L. And it's given us the ability to predict, optimize and rationalize the amount of labor that is necessary, which has been very positively impacted by another digital tool, which is our eRental platform. Now 55-plus percent of our customer base is choosing that to transact with us. It's a digital experience. Obviously, it doesn't require at-the-counter labor. So we can shift some of that traditional labor to other priorities' property to property. So that's been a very good optimization tool. It hasn't in any way relieved us of some of the pressure we're seeing from a hourly basis, but it's certainly been a very effective tool to minimize that impact. We're also making strong investments. Tom mentioned some of the things that we've started to do over the last couple of years with solar. Utilities are under a lot of pressure market to market. We've got a great opportunity and an accelerated investment going into our solar platform. We have, as I mentioned, 200 million square feet of assets. That equates to about 150 million square feet or more of rooftops that are wide open for investments. And then another thing that continues to change in the business that we continue to optimize is the amount of remote operations, property to property that makes sense. We've been testing this for the last three years. We've got a fleet of kiosks, for instance, in our portfolio that today is about 200. We're continuing to evaluate that property by property, and we're just looking for any and all tools to continue to rationalize the pressure you're speaking to. And we've been pleased. And it's certainly playing through in our margins, which this quarter, again, we're over 80%. So Tom, you can add any additional color to that. Tom Boyle : Joe, I think you covered it well. Samir Khanal : Okay. And then I guess on my second question is, clearly, rate growth is still strong here. But tell me if I'm wrong. But when I look at occupancy, it looks like you're at a level, I mean, maybe even 30, 40 basis points above of '19 year when I look at 3Q. I guess how should we think about the trade-off? Or how are you managing between sort of rate growth and occupancy at this time and sort of into next year? Tom Boyle : Yes. Sure, Samir. Happy to dig into that a little bit. As I highlighted earlier, we did see a typical seasonal decline in occupancy. And as we look at occupancy performance at the end of September, we're about 80, 90 basis points over 2019, also over '18, '17 performance. So this is an area of revenue maximization we're ultimately seeking to achieve and are comfortable in that a 92% to 95% occupancy level, which we spent the entire quarter in and feel like we have the tools to ultimately maximize and optimize revenue in that ZIP code. And so feel good about where occupancy is today and clearly have had the benefit of being able to push rent both for our new customers and existing within that occupancy ZIP Code. Operator : Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open. Smedes Rose : I just kind of want to follow up on that last question as you look into 2023. And Joe, you mentioned, I think, a lot of people see recession is imminent at this point. Would you expect promotional and kind of marketing spend next year to get back towards kind of pre-pandemic levels? And just kind of interested in hearing more about your sort of willingness, I guess, to protect occupancy getting more aggressive potentially on the pricing side if the economy shows a significant sort of downshift. Tom Boyle : Yes. I mean I'd say stepping back, we certainly have good tools to manage different types of operating environments, and I think it's too early to speculate exactly what 2023 will look like. But going back in time, we have used promotional discounts. We've used advertising in a more meaningful way. Throughout the pandemic and getting to 2020 and 2021, we really didn't need to use things like promotional discounts or advertising because demand was so strong. Clearly, we could be heading into an environment where that won't be the case. And even in the quarter, we used probably more typical levels of advertising and promotional even in a strong environment. So thinking about advertising spend in the quarter, we spend about 1.5% of revenue in the quarter. And that's towards the low end of our historical range of, call it, 1% to 3%, where in 2019, for instance, we were towards the higher end there. On a promotional basis, similarly, last year, we were hardly offering any promotions. This year, we had very modest promotional discounts in the quarter, about 38% of our customers that moved in, in the quarter, received promotions in a typical year. In the third quarter, that's more like 70%. And so we're still running it at levels that give us a lot of tools heading into next year to navigate what could be a recessionary environment, and we'll certainly use those to our advantage in that environment. And I'm not sure if that answers the question. Smedes Rose : Yes. No, that's helpful. The other thing I just wanted to ask you is. Did you see a significant uptick in tenant insurance claims in Florida and the aftermath of Hurricane Ian? Or is there something in your numbers that might be worth calling out around that? Or are you -- or does it not really show up in a meaningful way? Joe Russell : Yes, Smedes. First of all, fortunately, we did not see a heavy impact from the hurricane itself. Our team did an admirable job on a number of fronts. We closed plus or minus 100 properties or so for a period of a few days, first and foremost, to keep employees and customers in a very safe environment. We were very fortunate, as I mentioned, we only had 12 to 15 properties that had, I would call, any level of significant impact, mostly flooding-related. The property claims are roughly $2 million or so, and then the tenant insurance claims are at this point expected to be about $4 million. And statistically, we're dealing with, plus or minus, say, 3,000, 3,500 units. So very small and, as I mentioned, fortunate occurrence for us relative to where properties are located and the impact, we're clearly seeing obviously, a lot of retooling going on to those areas for overall recovery, but fortunately, not a lot of economic impact to us specifically. Operator : Our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Can you help describe what the ECRI program look like in 2022 in terms of level of increases or frequency? And how do you think this program might change moving forward in an environment where we're potentially going to see negative street rates and negative occupancy? Tom Boyle : So sure, Ki Bin, I'll answer it, and Joe can chime in as well. So the way we think about existing tenant rate increases is really around breaking it into a couple of components. One is, understanding how our customers are behaving. And we have a wealth of information and testing data going back years, and it's a constant dynamic testing environment that we live through kind of month-to-month. And that gives us the ability to predict how customers will behave and how they'll react to different sorts of increases. And what we've experienced over the last couple of years, and Joe highlighted this earlier, is customers have found a lot of value in our storage units. And that's, frankly, increased through the pandemic. Length of stays are at record highs, and so the number of tenants eligible to receive an increase have moved higher over the last several years, and they've behaved really well. And so, we've experienced now 9 months or 10 months through 2022, that consumer base has remained remarkably consistent, i.e., the models are predicting what it is that the customers are going to react to and we're seeing very consistent performance. The second component is around when a customer does vacate, what's the cost to replace that tenant. And certainly, over the past couple of years, the cost of -- to replace that tenant has decreased as move-in demand has been strong, moving rates have been higher. And as we move through 2022, as anticipated, some of that is moderating. And I would note move-in demand continues to be very healthy. And as I noted earlier, we had a good move-in quarter with move-in volumes up 9% but moderating from earlier in the year. And so that component of the existing tenant rate increase program is likely to result in moderating overall activity as we move forward. But that's just one piece of it. And as consumers continue to behave well and length of stays are longer, that gives us incremental tools on the other side of the equation in effect. Ki Bin Kim : And going to your comments about record lengths of stay, your move-out activity was up 12%. I'm just curious, is the group of customers that are moving out, is that at all different in terms of mix, meaning are customers that have been in there longer over a year moving out to a higher degree than before? Or is it pretty consistent? Tom Boyle : It's pretty consistent. What we've seen is really across the board depending on you slice and dice the tenants by demographies, psychographics, et cetera, you'd see relatively broad-based increases in vacate levels up from the really lows that we experienced in 2020 and 2021. But move-out volumes remain attractive, frankly, versus pre-pandemic levels. And so again, both the mix of tenants has moved more favorably. And as you slice and dice that tenant base, they continue to perform well versus pre-pandemic levels, although off last year is really record highs or record lows. Thanks, Ki Bin. Operator : Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Juan Sanabria : Just hoping to talk about the consumer a little bit. You kind of talked about how occupancy was above pre-COVID levels. So you're in a position of strength. But yet the new street rate growth is kind of low single digits, well below the headline inflation. So just curious on how we should really think about strong demand, limited vacates, higher length of stay, but the street rates being modest, still positive but modest despite having record occupancy. And it's just -- it's a little bit of a -- just why would that be the case that you're not able to extract more from street rates? Is there some sort of counterpoint to their ability to pay or price sensitivity that you guys are seeing in the revenue management that's causing that? Tom Boyle : Yes. One maybe I'd highlight we have had an ability to increase move-in rents through most of the year, and we've had some moderation as expected as we move through the year. I think as we've moved into the fall and into a more seasonal decline in occupancy, we've seen the industry broadly away from us lowering their rental rates because they have more inventory, and I think that that's to be expected, and we certainly have seen that over the last couple of months, which is leading to a different environment than what we saw last year, right, which we didn't see a seasonal decline in occupancy. So as you think about the scarcity of inventory different year-over-year, you're going to see a different rental rate behavior across the industry, and we've seen that. And we're not -- we're seeing some moderation, and I think the rest of the industry looking at what streets that many of you report are showing some declines as well. The flip side is web visits continue to be strong. Our web visits, so you should think about having a little bit more inventory, maybe a little bit more of a seasonal decline in rental rates, the overall demand environment remains healthy. Web visits were flat, basically right on top of what was a record year last year through the third quarter. So speaking to the move-in environment and the move-in volumes certainly performing well through the third quarter is the counterbalance of that rate discussion. Juan Sanabria : Good. And then just for Los Angeles, how much more growth can you capture from bringing existing customers to street rates? I guess how much more juice do you have left for that to continue to accelerate sequentially? Or have you kind of gotten back to levels where you would have wanted if you had not been to around restrictions? Joe Russell : Yes. Juan, I mentioned Los Angeles, certainly one of our top-performing markets. And we've got more to go there, frankly. I mean you step back and you think about not only the fact that we've been handcuffed for three-plus years, it is a market where there's very little, new product coming into the market, very good dynamics relative to inherent deep-seated demand. We've seen a little bit of move-out volume, but it's come right back on the move-in side. Occupancies are still quite strong, and we think we've got good pricing opportunities even going into 2023. So this has not ended. Juan Sanabria : So just a quick last one. Can you give us any update on the October data, whether it's occupancy or street rates and how those trended at the end of the end of October? Tom Boyle : Yes. Occupancy, as we look at the end of October, declined a little bit as we anticipate as we move through the fall. So I think occupancy ended up at or 92.8 rather at the end of October, down from the 93.3 at the end of September, again, generally in line with our expectations. Move-in rates for the quarter and move-in volumes, move-in volumes, again, quite strong. I mean move-in volumes up 10%-ish. Move-in rate did decline a couple of percent so that moderation in asking rent, given the seasonality has played through October as well. But overall, a good move-in month in October as well. Juan Sanabria : Great. So was it down 2%, negative 2% year-over-year? Tom Boyle : Yes, yes, down a couple of questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is now open. Spenser Allaway : Apologies if I missed this, but could you comment on cap rates and what you're seeing in terms of the breadth or volume of assets being marketed today? Joe Russell : Sure, Spenser. Predictably, this has been a far lighter year as far as sector trading. At the beginning of the year, we saw a little bit of carryover from the volume that played through in 2021, which obviously was historic. But quarter-by-quarter, we've seen the realization set in as interest rates continue to rise and cap rates have adjusted in lockstep, I would tell you that, as always, the more stabilized higher profile or more highly desirable, stabilized assets are likely going to trade at a lower cap rate than otherwise. But I would tell you, year-over-year, we're probably in a zone where cap rates have adjusted by 100 basis points or so. 2021 was an opportune time to be a seller to command, in many cases, historic valuations with a lot of bidding activity at the table. It's a very different environment today. It doesn't mean that trading has ended because we're still seeing some deals trade. There hasn't been anything close to $1 billion or more come into the market, and I doubt will between now and the end of the year. And what we've been able to do is find the same type of asset that we've been very successful integrating in our portfolio with what we feel is a more compelling investment opportunity, where we're inheriting or taking on lease-up opportunity. The $760 million or so that we've transacted on so far this year, average occupancies hovering around 60% or so, that gives us that upside. But the amount of volume needs to continue to grow to really lockstep with what really will basically settle out as a different cap rate environment, but it's -- cap rates are higher. Spenser Allaway : Okay. That's really helpful. And just given all the commentary and the current economic landscape, I was just wondering if you could walk us through your capital allocation priority list. I mean you sort of just touched on that. But where do you see the most value creation today as you look across your various growth avenues? Joe Russell : Sure. It always starts with development. So our development pipeline is $1 billion now. And it has been, and we still see, the inherent opportunity to drive the highest level of value through our development activities, whether it's with ground-up or redevelopment assets. The team is working hard, finding very strong opportunities to either take down vacant land sites or retool existing properties, whether we own or go in and do a redevelopment on an existing asset of some form. So we're still seeing very good returns, and we're keeping the team very busy looking for, even in this environment, an opportunity to do what we can do very differently, which is source deals with fewer competitors at the table. I'll tell you there's been a growing population of owners that are coming to us. Speaking to the risk, I noted in my opening comments, it is far riskier to be a developer today than it was one, two or three years ago. Part of that's been driven by a very new dynamic, which is much higher construction cost lending and just the availability of it, frankly. And then on top of that, we've got inflation playing through. So if you don't have the mechanisms to back down some of the very intense component costs increases, you may find yourself in a very different environment relative to the ultimate return you're going to see on an asset. Land can be more or less expensive depending on the particular market, but there could be more competition there, too. So long story short, more risk of development. But for our own purposes, it's still the highest rate of return that we're seeing from a capital allocation standpoint. And we're very pleased by the deliveries that we put in the market and what we've got going into 2023. Now as far as acquisitions, again, going right back to my prior comments, we're definitely seeing a different environment relative to the cap rates that are playing through, but we are finding good assets still bringing into the portfolio, where we can more often than not by underperforming assets for a variety of reasons, pulling right in the portfolio and get good upside from that. So it's been a unique environment for us to go out and find something stabilized that we're just going to pay a top per square foot value for it because, frankly, we can do better things with our own capital by taking other assets that aren't either mature or have some level of additional upside. And that's been a really good investment opportunity for us, not only with the $5.1 billion that we acquired last year, but the $760 million that we acquired this year. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mike Mueller : I guess kind of as a follow-up to the prior question, what are you underwriting for time frames and returns on developments that you're starting today versus something you would have started a year ago? Tom Boyle : Sure, Mike. We typically underwrite, and this hasn't changed over the last couple of years despite the fact that lease-up has been quite strong. We typically underwrite three to four years to get to stabilized NOI levels. And obviously, we're in an industry where you start a new property at 0% occupancy, and it takes some time to attract new tenants to that facility and stabilize that tenant base and the ultimate revenue there, so still looking at underwriting three to four years of stabilization. Mike Mueller : Got it. And I guess on Joe's prior comments about cap rates being up 100 basis points. Is that applicable, too, for, I guess, the value-add acquisitions that you're buying, where you're going in at 60%, 70% leased at low yield? That exit, that ultimate stabilized cap rate, would you say that that's up about 100 as well for what you're looking at? Joe Russell : Yes. I think it applies to the overall spectrum of different assets, whether, again, they're in -- they're fully stabilized and/or they're in lease-up. I mean, frankly, it's just the, I think, pretty obvious impact from much higher interest rate levels. Operator : Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Todd Thomas : I just wanted to stick with investments. Tom, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're ready to use the balance sheet to grow and that it's well positioned. And so just following up on sort of the line of questioning around investments, where it sounds like cap rates are moving higher. What would you look for in terms of acquisitions to become more aggressive and put the balance sheet to work a bit more? And what's the spread like today with the movement that you're seeing in cap rates between stabilized NOI yields on developments and stabilized acquisitions? Joe Russell : So yes, Todd, I'll talk to the first part of your question, and Tom can give you more color on the spreads. But the playbook that we have, I would say, is similar to what you've seen us do over the last two years or more, which is to find and unlock opportunities relative to -- on the acquisition side, the types of assets that we think we're going to be much more benefited by bringing in underperforming assets, putting them in our platform and getting actually very quick improvement. And you've seen that with big scale portfolios that we've taken down. Clearly, 2022 has not been an environment where we've seen the bigger legacy portfolios coming to the market, but the smaller opportunities are at the table. It takes a little bit more volume, obviously, to get to that level of investment that we saw in 2021. But the team is working really hard. We're open for business. We see compelling reasons to go into a variety of different markets where we can additively put assets into the platform, integrate them very quickly and see that upside. On development, again, it's as broad-based as acquisitions in, meaning that we've got 50-plus properties in our pipeline right now in all parts of the United States. We've got a deep seated team. We're looking for very good well-located sites, and we're going to continue to find good capital allocation opportunities through that platform as well. So the investment arena tied to acquisitions is far less predictable than -- because development is much more intentional, obviously. But we're ready. We've got the balance sheet well primed. We'll see how things change going into an environment where we may or may not be in this imminent recession. That, too, can present different opportunities that I think we're very well seated to go out and use our balance sheet to grow the portfolio, just as Tom indicated. Tom Boyle : Yes. And then, Todd, your question around, clearly, the debt markets have been moving. I think taking a step back, we're looking at the real estate itself in underwriting the cash flow profile associated with that real estate. And we have more and more tools each year to do so, thinking about certainly what we think we can stabilize a property app, but then also thinking about what the growth profile is in submarkets. So it depends asset to asset, submarket to submarket. We use the tools that our data science team has developed around predictive analytics for rent growth, and that all factors into that cash flow profile. So on an unlevered basis, we will also look at replacement costs, and what's the basis that we're achieving with the asset as well. So, all those go into the mix and certainly a range there. On the cost of capital front, no question, debt costs have moved higher. But we do find ourselves in a place where we have on a relative basis versus the industry attractive, both cost and access to capital. And while the spreads have come down certainly on a levered basis, we're looking at the acquisitions that we're purchasing in the fourth quarter. We feel very good about the unlevered returns we're going to achieve and the FFO accretion that we'll achieve in the coming years. Todd Thomas : And how do those unlevered returns? Or what's the spread look like between the acquisitions today that you're seeing and what's in the market relative to what you're developing, right? I think your stabilized yield expectations, the NOI, the future NOI that you were discussing that you've outlined for us on developments relative to what market cap rates were -- was pretty wide over the last couple of years. My sense is that, that's narrowing right now, what's that spread look like today? Tom Boyle : Yes. As you think about development, we do underwrite and seek to achieve a higher return on development because of the risk profile and the lease-up that we just spoke to. We're taking three to four years of lease up there. But ultimately, we're plugging those assets that we've designed the building. We designed the unit mix. We've picked the location and then we're plugging it into the largest and most efficient operating platform in the country. And so that gives us an ability to achieve strong yields on those development projects. Looking at the yields we've historically targeted, we're looking at 8% plus stabilized yields, and we feel good about those sorts of yields continuing moving forward and the unlevered returns associated with that profile. Todd Thomas : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on something that you mentioned related to occupancy earlier. I appreciate the color on -- that you provided on October. But can you talk about the range of occupancy loss that you might expect now throughout the balance of the off-peak rental season through the end of the year and really into '23? I think I heard you say 92% to 95% is kind of the right range to think about occupancy. Was that what you were referring to and sort of pointing to and what we should think about sort of trough to peak or peak to trough going forward at this point? Tom Boyle : Yes. I mean, I think generally speaking, that range that I was speaking to is how the Company has operated and maximized revenue through the years. I would say there's definitely a difference by market. And so today, Los Angeles demand remains strong. We obviously haven't been able to move rental rate increases for some time. So occupancies are lower year-over-year in Los Angeles. You typically see higher occupancy in the Los Angeles or San Francisco, given the limited new inventory that's added to those markets on a year-over-year basis, year in and year out. And the flip side is some of the Texas markets where you do see more inventory each year, but at the same time, you're seeing very strong population growth to support that. You typically don't see those same levels of occupancy, and so you're not going to see that level in the Houston per se. And ultimately, the revenue team is looking to maximize the revenue of each individual unit no matter where it is across the country, and so that's going to lead to a different price volume discussion depending on where you are. So hopefully, that's some context. In terms of where we'd anticipate heading through the fourth quarter, we've been consistent that we were expecting more seasonal occupancy decline. We've seen that through the third quarter, and we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter, obviously, market by market, which would point you down towards that 92% sort of occupancy towards the end of the year. And again, from a year-over-year standpoint, that would be relatively consistent with where we are now and would track consistent to 2019-type levels. Operator : Our next question will come from Ronald Kamden with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ronald Kamdem : Sorry, just going back to the marketing, sort of the marketing expenses and so forth. Maybe can you just a little bit more commentary on if its market specific, sort of what drove that year-over-year increases? Tom Boyle : Sure. And you're commenting on the year-over-year increase. I'd say largely, we didn't spend in most markets last year. And so yes, there's some big increases on a year-over-year basis coming from zero or close to zero in many markets last year. Ultimately, the marketing spend is managed dynamically by the same team that prices our units. And so that's part of the ingredient on maximizing NOI and maximizing revenue, and so that's managed dynamically in the submarkets. No question. There are some markets that we've supported more than last this year, areas that have more inventory to lease. Typically, we'll receive more marketing support. I'd say Los Angeles is probably still our lowest marketing spend market per property, given the strong demand dynamics we've seen there in our largest market. But that stepping back, like I said earlier, our overall marketing spend for the quarter was about 1.5% of revenue, which is towards the lower end of historical ranges, which gives us tools heading into next year. But when you don't spend much in the prior year or at all in some markets, the year-over-year comparison can look like a big increase. Ronald Kamdem : Great. That makes sense. And then just my last one would be on -- just on the ECRIs. And when you sort of take a step back and you look at the portfolio, right, record rents, look at the macro environment, inflation and potentially going into a recession, how do you think about sort of the pricing algorithms there? And is there anything that company would consider to think about maybe doing differently? I don't know if it's stress testing or just trying to figure out if the customer or the recommendations may be a little bit different this time versus previous cycles. Like how do you guys sort of square that circle as you go into next year? Joe Russell : That's a great -- It's a great question. And I think that what you just highlighted is core to how we price across for existing tenants as well as for new tenants, which is continuous testing. As I mentioned earlier, we have a wealth of information going back in time as well as in the current time period. We send over 1 million rental rate increases a year. That allows us the ability to do significant testing and holdouts to understand whether consumers are behaving as we anticipate and how that consumer would behave in a different level of increase, et cetera. So that's kind of core to the process and certainly will be heading into 2023 as well. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Katie, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Chelsea. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 22, 2022 (sic) [2023], and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that may become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, subsequent reports, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, after that, feel free to jump back in queue with additional questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m going to begin by providing color on two recent announcements. We\u2019ll then move on to our performance in 2022 and outlook for 2023. First, on February 5th, we announced a 50% increase to our quarterly common dividend, a raise from $8 to $12 per share on an annualized basis. It is a result of a great effort by the team that has produced record performance over the last few years and a validation of our ongoing confidence in the strength of our platform. Second, as announced separately, we made a proposal to acquire Life Storage at a substantial premium after several attempts to engage in negotiations privately. I\u2019d like to highlight a few important reasons why we think this combination is poised to unlock superior growth and value creation for shareholders. First, there is significant opportunity to accelerate growth and profitability as Life Storage\u2019s portfolio benefits from Public Storage\u2019s industry-leading brand. Our platform achieves approximately 80% same-store operating margins compared to Life Storage\u2019s margins at approximately 73%. And we see an opportunity to narrow that gap with their real estate assets as part of our industry-leading platform. Second, we believe there is significant upside to grow revenues and earnings in our respective ancillary business lines, including storage insurance, third-party property management, business customer offerings and lending. Third, we see expanded portfolio growth opportunities as we leverage Public Storage\u2019s fully integrated in-house development team, the only one of its kind in the industry, to capitalize on additional development and redevelopment opportunities to enhance Life Storage\u2019s existing portfolio. And finally, all of this will be supported by an industry-leading balance sheet with low pro forma leverage, an advantaged cost of capital and significant capacity to fund future growth in conjunction with retained cash flow. Since announcing the proposal, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both companies\u2019 shareholders who clearly recognize the significant benefits uniquely achievable through a combination with Public Storage. As you likely saw, on February 16th, Life Storage issued its own press release rejecting our proposal. Nothing in that response changed our thinking. We have a high level of conviction in the strategic and financial merits, and we are committed to pursuing a potential combination. We are encouraged, in that February 16th release, Life Storage indicated openness to opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We look forward to engaging in good faith discussions regarding a mutually agreeable combination. While we appreciate that analysts and shareholders have ongoing questions with respect to our proposal, the purposes of today\u2019s call is to discuss our fourth quarter earnings and our outlook for 2023. As such, we will not be addressing questions related to the proposal at this time. Now, turning to our performance and outlook. 2022 was a year of milestones for Public Storage, including celebrating our 50th anniversary. The team and platform achieved record results in our same-store and non-same-store portfolios, elevating the customer experience through technology and operating model transformation, enhancing our properties through the Property of Tomorrow program and growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment and third-party management. We did all of this while maintaining the industry\u2019s best balance sheet, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow. To name just a few of our collective accomplishments, we achieved an 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through the combination of revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. We grew beyond 200 million owned square feet and $4 billion in total revenues. We built our property development pipeline to approximately $1 billion. We received the prestigious Great Place to Work award based on feedback provided directly by our employees. And we achieved top-scoring U.S. self-storage REITs across the leading sustainability benchmarks. We are firing on all cylinders while strengthening the already formidable competitive advantages we have across our business. And those competitive advantages are heightened in the type of macro environment we are in today on top of two consecutive years of record 20%-plus core FFO growth. Simply put, we have the people, technologies, platforms and brand which lead us to a position of strength in 2023. Demand for self-storage remains strong, as you see with our move-in volume up more than 11% during the quarter. The aspects of the business that have historically made it resilient are on display. This is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from a newer driver in the form of people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Our customer lengths of stay are at record levels, a positive trend, given rent increases to existing customers are a key driver to our revenue growth. The outlook for new competitive supply is also in our favor. We are seeing less new property development nationally due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the macro landscape. With continuing strong demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are very well positioned in 2023. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. I\u2019ll start with a review of capital allocation for the year. We invested $1 billion between acquisitions and developments in 2022, including the $190 million Neighborhood Florida portfolio in the fourth quarter. That portfolio added to our over 400 properties that we\u2019re operating with our remote property management platforms. Overall, the 2022 acquisition environment was impacted by a shift of cost of capital with transaction volumes down and driven by smaller deals compared to 2021. We expect that trend to continue this year with our forecast for $750 million of transaction volume for Public Storage consistent with last year. We are well positioned as an acquirer today, given our industry-leading balance sheet and cost of capital. And adding to acquisitions, our development pipeline stands at approximately $1 billion as we seek to expand the portfolio with our in-house team. The development environment is challenging today across the industry, as Joe highlighted. Against that backdrop, Public Storage is planning on delivering $375 million of new generation 5 properties in 2023 and more in 2024, as we lean on our development competitive advantages. And we look forward to putting these new properties on our national platform to drive outperformance. Now, on the financial performance. We finished the year strong, reporting core FFO of $4.16 for the quarter and $15.92 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range and representing 22.4% growth over the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks. Let\u2019s look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 13% compared to the fourth quarter of \u201821. That performance represents a moderation from last quarter\u2019s 14.7% growth and a return to seasonality and tough comps comparing to 2021. Now on expenses, same-store direct costs of operations were up 5.3%. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 15.8% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout, growing 51% compared to last year. Now, I\u2019ll shift to the outlook. We introduced 2023 core FFO guidance with a $16.45 midpoint, representing 5.5% growth from 2022, again excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks. As we enter the year, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s a wide range of potential macroeconomic pathways that will influence customer demand and behavior. The consumer has held up well to this point in the year, but the Fed is certainly signaling they\u2019re not finished. If we look at the same-store revenue outlook, I\u2019d characterize the low end of the range of the outlook as a recessionary pathway and the higher end as a softer landing for the economy. We anticipate occupancy will be lower throughout the year and follow a typical seasonal pattern. Rate will be the driver of revenue growth with the moderation through the year based on lower move-in rents and tougher existing tenant rate increase comps. That moderation results in a trending towards longer-term averages of growth. Our expectations are for 5.75% same-store expense growth, driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of 3.2%. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are again poised to be a strong contributor, growing from $448 million of NOI contribution in 2022 to $520 million at the midpoint. And looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, the incremental non-same-store NOI to stabilization from those properties acquired or completed at December 31st is an additional $80 million of NOI. This pool of lease-up assets will continue to be a powerful growth engine over the next several years. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock solid. We have a well-laddered long-term debt profile with limited floating rate exposure and over $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. Our leverage of 3.4 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $800 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position, heading into 2023. So with that, I\u2019d like to open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning, out there. I guess maybe, Tom, for you, as you thought about setting guidance for this year, I can appreciate a number of the different components that you laid out, and there\u2019s kind of a wide range there. But I guess which components do you feel like have the most potential upside and downside risk, I guess, both on the revenue side and on the expense side where you could come back and be positively surprised or negatively surprised? Tom Boyle : Sure. That\u2019s a good question, Steve. So, I want to make a couple of comments here. One, I\u2019d like to comment a little bit around how the year has started, which is pretty consistent trends with what we saw through the fourth quarter. So move-in, move-out trends pretty consistent. We\u2019ve seen move-in volumes up circa 10%, move-in rates that have been down mid-single digits. So consistent with that, we call it, 5% plus or minus that we saw in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019re seeing continued good demand for storage through the first part of the year. But I do think in response to your question, I\u2019d like to break the year of 2023 into two halves. The first half, as we think about it, consistent trends as we\u2019ve seen through the fourth quarter into the first but facing really tough comps as we move through the first part of the year. And that\u2019s going to lead to some of the moderation I spoke to. The second -- but ultimately, with higher levels of absolute revenue growth, given we\u2019re starting the year from a position of strength. But if you think about the second part of the year, there\u2019s a couple of things to highlight. One, the comps will be easier in the second half of the year, given we\u2019ll be comping against a more seasonal end of 2021 -- or 2022, rather. But the flip side is the macro uncertainty is significantly higher. And so, as you think about the pathways that I described for the outlook, at the lower end, a recessionary pathway that we highlighted in some of our disclosures, that recessionary pathway likely leads to negative year-over-year revenue growth as you would be typical to see in a recession. But towards the higher end, certainly, that would lead to positive growth and easier comps and could result in better revenue growth performance as we move through the second half. And I\u2019d say, as we think about the year, the second half has much more uncertainty towards it than the first half does. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then second question, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s for you or for Joe, but just as you think about capital deployment, you still have $1 billion of development but you mentioned that doing new deals is challenging. Just help us understand kind of where you think acquisition yields are in relation to new development yields. Kind of where does that spread stand today? And how do you think that might trend over the next kind of one to two years? Joe Russell : Yes, Steve. There certainly is a continuing trend that played through in 2022 that we think still applies to 2023. First of all, on the acquisition side, likely to be lower volumes of transaction activity. Certainly, we\u2019re seeing that by virtue of how the year started off. It\u2019s not a typical year in and year out where the first quarter or so might be on the light side. That\u2019s definitely the case as we speak. So, we\u2019re looking for and evaluating the trends tied to impacts from higher cost of capital, limited availability of capital, again, how sellers are looking at this environment to transact assets. Typically, more stabilized assets are going to command stronger cap rates. I\u2019d tell you today compared to maybe where we were a year ago, cap rates are still up in that 100, 125 basis-point range where stabilized assets might have a 5 handle on them, whether it\u2019s low, mid or high-5, cap rate\u2019s going to depend on location, quality of the asset, et cetera. And then, depending on this stabilized level of the asset, there\u2019s going to be more flexibility in the cap rate. And you\u2019re going to see different pricing mechanisms tied to those types of assets. Our focus, as it has been to actually look for those kinds of assets because that\u2019s where we see the higher value creation. That certainly played through the acquisition volume that we captured that Tom talked about, in 2022. So we\u2019re still out hunting for good quality assets. Our backlog right now between closed and under contract\u2019s approximately $70 million. But frankly, the market is a little slow right now, so we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s not unusual for though the market to start picking up toward the summer months so we\u2019ll see again how that plays through on that set of opportunities. Now, on the flip side, from a development standpoint, as you mentioned, yes, our pipeline continues to be quite robust. It\u2019s more difficult to do development not any different than what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year or two. Our team is working hard to extract prime land sites. We\u2019re actually finding some very good opportunities there. But frankly, we\u2019ve got skills and abilities that our competitors in the private world particularly do not have. And with that, we\u2019ve been able to extract prime sites, good opportunities to actually get the types of returns that we\u2019ve been speaking to for the last couple of years, where we\u2019re expecting plus or minus 8% or north cash-on-cash yields on these investments. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by our own pipeline. We\u2019re encouraged, as Tom mentioned, relative to the lease-up and the contribution those types of assets have to our overall revenue and NOI performance. And our non-same-store portfolio continues to be very vibrant. So, we\u2019re very encouraged that we\u2019ve got the right skills and the fortitude and the ability to look long term through what could be still a very challenging development cycle, which frankly, is a good thing. It gives us more ability to actually go out and capture, as I mentioned, those great land sites, put our Gen 5 properties into a variety of different markets. And nationally, we\u2019ve got good opportunities across the spectrum, so we\u2019re going to continue to focus on that as we speak. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : On the guidance, you said the low end of the range is for a recession scenario while the high end\u2019s a soft landing. Do you see a 50% probability of a soft landing, you end up at the high end, and a 50% probability of a recession, you end up at the low end, or is it more 75-25 or another combination? I\u2019m trying to understand the likelihood of where you see yourself ending up within that range at this time. Tom Boyle : Sure. Good question, Michael. So, I think there\u2019s a couple of things there. The first is we wanted to provide a range that encapsulated multiple pathways because we know everyone on this call probably has their own point of view as to what percentage probability a recessionary pathway is or a soft landing is. And so, we thought it was appropriate to provide that wide range, and obviously, investors can make their own perspective. As we look at it, we look at the potential outcomes as relatively balanced within that range, but we don\u2019t obviously know what the Fed is going to do and how the consumer is going to react. 3 or 4 weeks ago, interest rates were lower. There was talk of a no landing over those 3 weeks. We\u2019ve gone back to the fact that maybe that no landing is off the table. So, I think that\u2019s going to ebb and flow as we go through the year. And our objective was to provide investors and analysts a framework to understand what could play out through the year according to those macro pathways. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. And then, on ECRIs this year, pre-pandemic, you were sending increases of 8% to 10%, let\u2019s say, every 12 months. And over the past 1.5-year, you\u2019ve been sending maybe mid-teens, high teens increases every 9 months or so. So for the upcoming year -- and included in your guidance, can you help quantify the expected rate and frequency of ECRIs over the year? Obviously, it\u2019s going to change depending on the different scenarios. But maybe if you can talk about what the plan is and just kind of maybe how the top-of-funnel traffic looks right now because this is going to play a role in your ability to pass along the ECRIs this year? Thank you. Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Michael. So, to talk specifically about the existing tenant rate increase program, and then I\u2019ll hit around the top-of-funnel demand as well. We\u2019ve consistently spoken about our existing tenant rate increase program is really two components. The first is how is the consumer reacting to increases? How are they performing and behaving? And we\u2019ve noted in the past and I would reiterate today that the consumer continues to perform at expectations and the sensitivity is largely in line with expectations. And so, there\u2019s no real change to the thought process around that program on that side. But the second component is the cost to replace that tenant when they leave. And there\u2019s no question that that\u2019s changed quite a bit over the last several years. You had markets like Miami where rents were up 25%, 30% and there was no cost to replace. There was, in fact, a benefit to replace a potentially in-place tenant. And so that started to shift as we moved through \u201822 and into \u201823. And that impact will result in lower magnitude and lower frequency increases but still to optimize revenue from that pool of existing tenants and new tenants that come in. Then the second part of your question around how is top-of-funnel demand performing, I think, is an important one, because as Joe mentioned, move-in volumes through the fourth quarter were up nearly 12%. Move-in volumes through the part of this year are up double digits as well. And so, we\u2019re seeing good demand from new customers coming into the system. Now, we\u2019re spending a little bit more on advertising. Our rates are a little bit lower. There\u2019s a little bit more promotional discounts in order to achieve that. But ultimately, the customers are very willing and looking forward to storage spaces to move into. And that\u2019s enabling us to capture those tenants, which I think is where you were going with the question. Those tenants will be good long-term tenants or a portion of them will as they move through 2023 as well. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in 2023. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector : I guess I\u2019d like to -- I\u2019m going to push a little bit on the guidance here. I totally understand, given the macro picture here and lack of clarity, first half, second half. Let\u2019s focus on, I guess, peak leasing season. When does that really start? And what -- if we\u2019re through, let\u2019s just say, June, July, like is that the bulk of it? Because again, my understanding is that I think there\u2019s even a lag to any recession where it hits storage. So I\u2019m just trying to get a picture of like how this could shake out, play out through the most important months, your peak leasing season. Tom Boyle : Yes. I think to answer the question directly, we typically see the peak leasing season really start in April, pick up in May in a really big way and then, then into June and July. So to your point, it\u2019s not very far away. And we\u2019re already seeing some of the seasonal patterns that you would anticipate in some of our markets, right? The more seasonal markets are already starting to see a pickup in our occupancy as we sit here in February compared to the end of the year, for instance. And so that typical seasonal pattern is starting to play out, which is encouraging. And I think where you may be going is, there\u2019s certainly a chance that if there is a recession that comes, it\u2019s later in the year and not earlier in the year. And that certainly would impact the financial performance of the sector through the year. And obviously, if it\u2019s a good busy season, that has a very positive impact on overall financial performance and operational performance of the business. Jeff Spector : Thanks Tom. Does that then, I mean, change or alter any strategy during the peak leasing months to grab more customers? Like, how do you operate, given this uncertainty? Again, things seem rock solid right now but preparing potentially for, let\u2019s say, a weaker fall or winter months or potentially into \u201824. Tom Boyle : Yes. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re constantly looking to dynamically manage the current environment. And as we just noted, it\u2019s hard to know exactly where we\u2019ll be sitting next year at this time. But we\u2019ll be planning week by week and day by day through our operational team to react to what we\u2019re seeing and ultimately maximizing our own performance and serving our customers well through a busy time period in the summer when there\u2019s typically strong demand for our storage space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO. Juan Sanabria : Just looking to further the discussions on the same-store revenue guidance. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you expect within the range the fourth quarter exit run rate to be. And if I think about last year, you guys really called it like you saw it. You were well ahead of the peers in the initial guidance set. And relative to some of the maybe more tried and true, kind of being a little bit more conservative and planning to be in raise game. Are you guys changing it up, or are you really trying to call it like you see at this time with the full acknowledgment that the uncertainty is much greater this year? Tom Boyle : Well, there\u2019s a whole host of questions in there, Juan. So, let me try to take a few of them at a time here. So I think the first part of the question is around the second half and talking a little bit more about the second half and maybe even, you\u2019re trying to tease out from me 2024 guidance. But I think the -- I do think the characterization... Juan Sanabria : Just fourth quarter. Tom Boyle : Yes, just fourth quarter, right. So, I\u2019ll go back to the first half, second half comment, which is the first half and the tougher comps that we\u2019re going to experience is going to lead to some moderation as we face those comps through the first half, which will lower the absolute level of growth as we go through the first half. And then, the second half, to the points I made earlier, really will depend on the busy season performance, like Jeff was just speaking to, and the macroeconomic environment and how the consumer is impacted by what the Fed is likely to do and the excess savings that the consumers have for a period of time and how quickly they burn through that excess savings, et cetera. And I think as we looked at that and modeled different consumer behavior through the year, there\u2019s a number of different moving pieces there, right? One is new storage demand, the other is existing tenant performance, rate sensitivity, delinquency, all of those things. And if you look at a typical recessionary environment, what you\u2019d find is weakness really across the board in those metrics, which is what\u2019s led to negative year-over-year revenue performance and recessions in the past. So, in that recessionary pathway we\u2019ve spoken to, we would expect that there is negative year-over-year revenue declines, like we\u2019ve seen in prior recessions. But you will have the benefit of easier comps in the second half, which will help offset some of that potential weakness. On the flip side, right, we\u2019re just talking about, well, is the recession, when does it come? How deep is it? All those sorts of things, which we can sit here and prognosticate on, but ultimately, we\u2019re going to find out over the next 6 to 12 months. If the consumer is stronger, if the labor market holds up more effectively, if the Fed doesn\u2019t push the labor market as tough, there could certainly be a situation where there\u2019s pretty healthy positive growth in the second half because of that strength of the U.S. consumer and the fact that we\u2019ll be having easier comps in the second half. And so, I think that\u2019s our sense of the range of potential outcomes, and I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question. And then, as it relates to exactly how we\u2019ll exit, I think it will depend on how that second half moves forward. Juan Sanabria : That\u2019s right. And then, just on expenses, curious if you could just give a little bit more color or numbers around the major food group\u2019s property taxes, marketing, et cetera, that I know you called out a little bit in your prepared remarks but hoping to flesh that a little bit more. Tom Boyle : Yes, sure. So specifically within the same-store operating expenses, our largest operating expense line item is property taxes. We ended the year 2022 with property taxes with a 4-handle percent growth on them. We continue to expect that that\u2019s likely to be a higher growth rate as we move into the coming years, given the NOI growth that we\u2019ve seen in the sector over the past several years. So, we\u2019re expecting something like 5% to 6% growth there, and obviously, we\u2019ll update as we move through the year. That\u2019s certainly the biggest driver of operating expense growth. The others are smaller. The second one I highlighted in my prepared remarks was marketing. So, you saw, in the fourth quarter, we increased marketing expense. That was to drive further top-of-funnel demand into the system, and we saw very good returns associated with that, really comping against a period in 2021 when there was very little spending in most of our markets. So, the percentage growth looks elevated against really low comps. So marketing expense is likely to be another one, because in the first part of this year, we\u2019re facing those similar really low comps. Some of the other line items that are facing inflationary pressures, again, the strength of the labor market today continues. There\u2019s wage pressure. But you could see even in the fourth quarter, we were able to mitigate some of those wage pressures, given the digital transformation and operating model transformation that we\u2019ve been working through over the past several years, which has led to efficiencies in staffing. So that will help mitigate. And then utilities is another one that we\u2019ve seen utility rates move higher, but we\u2019re looking to combat that with our investments in energy efficiency, be it our solar programs, which we\u2019re seeking to add about 300 properties with solar by the end of the year to bring our aggregate total to about 500 properties and with more room to go there in future years as well as our LED conversion helping to mitigate that. So, that\u2019s a high-level landscape of a number of the line items. Happy to go into any further detail if helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Tom, first question, I guess, back to the guidance. You mentioned that occupancy will likely be lower throughout the year. Was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more detail there around what you might expect at sort of the low and high end of the range relative to where you ended the year, so call it, down 250 basis points. Do you see that year-over-year spread widening or narrowing as you move throughout the year? Tom Boyle : Well, let me talk about the first half first and then we can talk about the second half, which obviously, we\u2019ve spoken about, there\u2019s macro uncertainty that will influence that. But as you think about the first half, we\u2019re starting the year with occupancy down about 2.4%. And we do think the occupancy decline that we experienced in the back half of 2022 was a seasonal occupancy decline. In fact, the decline from June to December was a touch better than a typical seasonal decline. But inherent in that is that what we\u2019re seeing today is a pickup in occupancy in some of our seasonal markets. So, I would anticipate there\u2019s certainly the opportunity for that spread to narrow as we get into the busy season as we\u2019ve spoken to, but then would follow a typical seasonal pattern from there in the back half. Todd Thomas : Okay. And when you talk about the seasonal markets where you\u2019re already starting to see some occupancy build, which markets are those? Tom Boyle : Well, they typically tend to be colder weather markets, so your Miamis and your Los Angeles and San Diegos, you don\u2019t see that same seasonal pattern. But if you look at a Minneapolis or Chicago or the Northeast, you start to see that seasonal pattern be more pronounced. Todd Thomas : Okay, got it. And then just circling back to capital deployment and some of the comments that you made earlier around investments. When making acquisitions and some larger deals like you did in 2021, you\u2019ve talked about upside to the initial yields through margin improvements, the Company\u2019s scale and so forth. And I think sort of an extreme example, maybe not extreme, but I think one example during 2021 was the $1.5 billion All Storage deal, which I think was sort of a 2%, mid-2% cap rate going in with an expectation to substantially increase that at stabilization. I realize the environment is different today and all deals have different characteristics. But as you look at the current landscape and think about acquisitions, would you still be willing to tolerate initial dilution relative to your cost of capital early on, like you have in \u201821 or in prior cycles, or does the greater uncertainty today give you a little bit of pause around how you think about future growth and the spread to your cost of capital that you would be willing to invest at? Joe Russell : Yes, Todd. I mentioned what we\u2019ve been doing strategically now for the last three years or more is looking for opportunities with assets that do have that upside that you\u2019re speaking to. So, whether it\u2019s through some of the larger portfolios, All Storage included, we bought that portfolio at about 74% occupancy, had a nice lift really in a very short period of time relative to continued lease-up and stabilization of the revenue metrics, et cetera. And we\u2019ve done the exact same thing with one-off deals as well. So, that\u2019s something we\u2019re not going to be shy about doing, and it continues to be a very good playbook for us. When we\u2019ve got deep-seated knowledge market to market, which we do on the vast majority of deals that we acquire, we have an elevated level of confidence that once we put these assets into our own platform, you can see that extracted opportunity literally right out of the gate. You see the benefits as we\u2019ve been speaking to relative to our brand, our platform, our efficiencies that assist higher-margin, opportunities, et cetera. So, we\u2019re definitely looking for those kinds of assets and have not backed away from them at all. So, that has and will continue to be a very vibrant part of our capital allocation process. Operator : Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser Allaway : Can you provide an update on the rent freeze that was put in place related to the California storms early in the year? Has this been lifted? And if not, is there any type of NOI headwinds contemplated in guidance? Tom Boyle : Sure. So I think, Spenser, you\u2019re speaking to the storms that took place in early January out here in California. There was a state of emergency that was put in place that is expiring here in February. So, I think, as anticipated, there\u2019s going to continue to be one-off events like storms and rain in California, believe it or not that can lead to state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And we\u2019ll navigate those. As it relates to what\u2019s embedded into our guidance expectations, there\u2019s things like that that come in and come out of different markets. And so, we\u2019ll try to take a reasonable estimate as to what those could be through the year. But we\u2019re not underwriting any significant rental rate restrictions as we move through the year embedded in our outlook. Spenser Allaway : Okay. And then you -- go ahead. Tom Boyle : No, go ahead. Spenser Allaway : I was going to say, you guys have provided a lot of great commentary on guidance in general and specifically on move-in rates and volumes and how those are trending thus far in \u201823. But, are you guys able to comment on the recent magnitude of ECRI activity? And then, without providing specific line item guidance, is there any color you can provide on what\u2019s being contemplated in terms of ECRIs at both, the high and low end of guidance? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, I\u2019d go back to my response around existing tenant rate increases earlier, which is that there\u2019s no question that in certain markets, we have a moderation in the magnitude and frequency that we\u2019ve sent them. And I highlighted Miami as an example where rents in Miami for new customers were up 25%, 30% each year for the past several years, and that\u2019s started to slow down as we anticipated. That market and others can\u2019t grow like that in perpetuity. But because of that, the magnitude and frequency of rental rate increases to existing customers is likely to moderate this year, and we\u2019ve already seen that at the start of the year. In terms of a band, I\u2019m not going to get into specifics around numbers or averages or whatnot, but there\u2019s a wide range of increases that we send to the tenant based on what we understand their sensitivity and the value they place in the unit as well as the cost to replace that tenant if they do choose to move out. And as we move through the year, that cost to replace a tenant could take different pathways along with the rest of the outlook. And so, in the stronger outlook, it\u2019s going to result in a stronger existing tenant rate increase, magnitude and frequency, and the weaker outlook for the tenants is going to have the opposite effect. Operator : Our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. A quick one first. Implicit in your 2023 guidance, what are you thinking for move-in rates? Tom Boyle : Yes. Good question, Ki Bin. So certainly, we started the year, as I\u2019ve highlighted, with move-in rents that are below prior year, and we finished the fourth quarter in a similar territory. We are anticipating that we see rents lift as we move through the busy season months. As you\u2019d anticipate, as customer demand increases, inventory gets tighter as you get to that point in the year and that will lead to higher absolute rents. But as I noted, earlier around the comments around the second half, there\u2019s a lot of variability on what could play out. Obviously, if we\u2019re in a recessionary environment, we\u2019d anticipate that move-in rental rates are lower as we\u2019re looking to capture demand. In an environment where consumer demand remains strong, that\u2019s going to result in higher rental rates as we move through the year. And as I noted earlier, part of the story in the second half compared to the first is comps. Right? The comps are definitely tougher in the first half than they are in the second. Ki Bin Kim : So maybe I should have rephrased it. So your move-in rents are down 5% as of 4Q. So, on a year-over-year basis, that\u2019s the way I\u2019m trying to understand the trend... Tom Boyle : And that\u2019s what they are right now, too, Ki Bin. That\u2019s what they are right now as well. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And on your CapEx guidance of $450 million, obviously, this line item has grown over the past three years, and you do a great job of breaking out between maintenance CapEx, Property of Tomorrow and the solar LED. I\u2019m just curious if some components of this CapEx might have a return associated with it and if you can provide some color around that. Joe Russell : The energy efficiency investment definitely leads to good returns. And as Tom mentioned, we\u2019re combing the portfolio as we speak for solar opportunities in particular. We\u2019ve basically re-lit the entire portfolio to LED. We had good, again, returns from that investment. And as the additional stimulus has come through with recent legislation, there\u2019s even more motivation on our part to continue to look at multiple markets. Likely, we\u2019ll get into a very sizable percentage of the entire portfolio that will help solar, I think, over the next, say, three to five years. But at the onset here, as Tom mentioned, we\u2019ve got 300 to 400 properties that are near term, likely very good candidates for good, strong returns. Property of Tomorrow, we\u2019re lifting the aesthetics and the curb appeal and some of the functionality of the properties. It\u2019s a little harder to measure specific returns on that type of investment. We do see a higher elevated level of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, et cetera. And then clearly, the enhancement market to market we\u2019re seeing from just the brand awareness, now that we\u2019re at a point of over 55% to 60% of the portfolio has been rebranded to the Property of Tomorrow standard market by market, and we\u2019re seeing very good receptivity to that as well. So, a little harder to measure just on a pure economic basis but continue to see good results from that investment as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Just going back to the guidance. Maybe any more color on sort of the bad debt assumption for the same-store revenue at the middle and at the upper and lower end of the range? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Ron, you\u2019re coming through kind of quiet, but I think what I heard was bad debt expectations that are embedded in the guidance outlook. Is that -- okay, good. So, I\u2019d characterize bad debt overall as being -- continue to be a good performance through the first part of this year and the back half of last year. We spoke a lot at the onset of the pandemic around how delinquency and bad debt really declined pretty dramatically. We\u2019re off those lows, but consumers continue to pay their bills and our delinquency remains a good bit below pre-pandemic levels. And so to speak to specifically the question on guidance and the ranges, in the recessionary pathway that we\u2019ve spent a good bit of time talking about this morning, we did increase the bad debt assumption associated with that as we would anticipate that we\u2019re likely to see bad debt increase through that pathway and the reversal towards the higher end. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then, my second one, you talked about sort of the macro assumptions in the guidance, which was super helpful. Just wondering, you guys are operating the business. Are there sort of any leading indicators that you would see in, first, maybe before sort of the macro turns, whether it\u2019s move-in volumes or whatever? Are there sort of leading indicators that you guys are tracking to sort of get a handle on this from the ground? Joe Russell : Yes. I mean, obviously, we\u2019re running a month-to-month lease business. We move in 80-plus-thousand customers on a monthly basis and we have a healthy amount of move-outs as well. So with that continuous flow of activity, we\u2019re constantly monitoring things like payment patterns to the degree of either change or what might be happening market to market relative to other macro events, et cetera. But, one of the more obvious metrics that we look at relative to just the stress of maybe the evolving nature of the economy at large is payment patterns. And as Tom just mentioned, those continue to be actually quite good. There\u2019s some elevated level of stress but it\u2019s, on a relative basis, still below what we saw pre pandemic. We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on it. We\u2019ve got new and different ways to actually track this now that so much of our business is tied to digital interaction with customers, et cetera. So, we\u2019ve got good tools to stay ahead of that and to guide us relative to whatever stress points might be evolving. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask you if you have -- if you\u2019ve seen any changes kind of in the supply outlook and if you maybe just have any insight into kind of developers\u2019 ability to access capital these days. Joe Russell : Yes. Smedes, I mentioned that in my opening remarks. We\u2019ve had the benefit nationally where deliveries have been somewhat static for the last two years, and we\u2019re looking at 2023 in very similar fashion relative to likely not an elevated uptick in overall deliveries. That ties to the amount of complication from a cost standpoint. There\u2019s more risk with many of the unknowns coming into the economy. And the complication is tied to just getting approvals as you go through step-by-step development processes. So, the overall supply picture is actually very good, meaning we\u2019re not seeing a rush to new development. Our lens through our third-party development platform gives us a little bit more validation of that as well where the majority of those opportunities are tied to development. And we\u2019re keeping even a closer eye on that beyond what our day-to-day development team and our real estate team is seeing as we\u2019re out either acquiring or looking for development opportunities. So hopefully, fingers crossed, we\u2019re going to continue to see that amount of deliveries through 2023 and going forward, again either in the same range or it could actually be a slightly downtick, but we\u2019ll continue to track that. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then I\u2019m just wondering sort of big picture, when you just look back over your long history at other periods of economic weakness and recessions, so maybe as we potentially head into one now, are there like kind of two or three things that you would -- you might do differently from a strategic perspective of what you had done in prior recessions, like either on the occupancy or the pricing front, or are there maybe more people on AutoPay now than there were then, which I would think kind of helps. But I\u2019m just kind of interested in any kind of color you have, given the Company has been around 50 years now, I guess. Joe Russell : Well again, cycle to cycle, we continue to take away best practices, different strategies, different ways to buffer and build upon not only our strengths, but it goes to the core of our platform and the resiliency that we see relative to those types of ebbs and flows of overall economic stress, et cetera. So, the things that we\u2019re constantly doing is running the business on a very fluid basis. We\u2019ve got more data now than clearly we\u2019ve ever had. I mentioned our move-in and move-out volume for instance. And then the amount of, again, testing that we do relative to pricing, whether it\u2019s marketing, whether it\u2019s promotions, all the tools that we have that are far more tied to analytical processes that can again guide us to optimization. So, we\u2019ve got great tools. We\u2019ve got great reconnaissance, and we think that we\u2019ve got even deeper technologies that we continue to make very strong investments into it, have served us well. We\u2019ve actually, in a whole variety of different ways, been able to test those in and out of, again, economic cycles, so we\u2019re going to continue to do just that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Keegan Carl : Yes. So maybe starting off with a bigger picture question here. When we think back to your May 2021 investor deck, you guys forecasted a long-term growth range of 6.7% to 9.2% on FFO. Just kind of curious, is that still in play going forward or do you anticipate growth to continue to moderate? Tom Boyle : Yes. So, looking back at that investor presentation, we broke out the different engines of growth, as I recall. And there\u2019s a number of them that I\u2019ll talk through here and it\u2019s worth. And I appreciate the question. I mean, the first one around longer term storage growth rates and the building blocks. Certainly, we\u2019ve had a couple of years of really incredible strong growth. We\u2019re talking about a year now where we\u2019re getting back towards -- trending towards those longer term averages. But one of the components of that engines of growth formula was the operational improvements and enhancements that we walked through. So, I spoke earlier around operating model transformation and the energy efficiency things that we\u2019re doing today that are benefiting our same-store NOI growth. The investor community got to hear from our revenue management and data science team, which to Joe\u2019s point just a moment ago, we continue to test and implement new systems and new approaches. And we have over 1 million move-ins and over 1 million rental rate increases a year. That is an ability to continue to fine-tune those processes. So, we think that\u2019s certainly intact. I think going through the other ones, the portfolio growth, there\u2019s no question that cost of capital has changed from the time when we walked through that deck. And so, I think that there\u2019s certainly some components of that that are going to change from one year to another. Certainly, we\u2019ve allocated a significant amount of capital over the last several years. Last year was more in line with our expectations that were set out at Investor Day. Complementary growth and leverage and other were the other components that led to that FFO growth outlook, and I think those are still absolutely intact as we continue to grow our tenant reinsurance platform, the third-party management business that Joe spoke to, our investment in Shurgard and the benefit that we received from that on down the list. So in summary, many of those factors are very much still in play and continue to push on our competitive advantages to drive that growth. I think the portfolio growth is the one that\u2019s going to ebb and flow more from one year to another. Keegan Carl : Got it. And I\u2019ll throw another tough one out here. But if we just think through the pandemic and the subsequent demand tailwind, how many first-time users do you think utilize self-storage? And how sticky do you guys expect these customers ultimately to be? I\u2019m just trying to sit here and reconcile where demand could level out, given your prior commentary where you don\u2019t necessarily anticipate any meaningful occupancy gain. Tom Boyle : Yes. So, the first part of the question around new first-time users. No question, there was a significant influx of new storage users through the pandemic. And we\u2019ve spoken a lot around different use cases as well, right? The combination of surge in home sale activity during a part of the last several years, now a decline in home sale activity, a change to hybrid work and a big pickup in home improvement activity that drove new first-time users of storage and, frankly, the fact that people are spending a lot more time in their homes. And we do think that\u2019s a tailwind as we move forward over time. And so, as you think about the adoption of storage has continued to grow from a smaller base in the 1970s to where it is today. And we\u2019re encouraged by those first-time users, the younger users that continue to seek storage as a good value to store their goods and do think that that is a tailwind for the industry moving forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : Yes. Hi. I think you mentioned the record length of stay. And I was wondering, first, can you just throw out the stats in terms of the percentage of customers there over a year and over two years? Tom Boyle : Sure. First, I\u2019ll mention the metric that we like to communicate, which is the average tenure of the in-place tenants. That\u2019s sitting right around 37 months today. And we\u2019ve spoken in the past around how that\u2019s up from, call it, 32, 33 months going back several years. And so, no question, a continued benefit of the longer length of stay as we sit here today, and Joe highlighted that in his prepared remarks. And then specifically to your question around, well, segmenting the different tenure bands, we still, today, have over 60% -- I think it\u2019s 61%, 62% of the customers are over -- have been with us for longer than a year. And longer than two years is a very healthy, call it, 43%, 44% as we sit here today. So, we continue to see pretty healthy trends there from the sticky existing tenant customer base. And that\u2019s something we\u2019re obviously watching closely and continue to be encouraged by. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then I guess going to not drilling down on the same-store guidance but you talked about the recession scenario versus soft landing. If you do head down that recession scenario, would you envision taking the foot off of the gas on development starts at all or probably not? Joe Russell : Yes. Mike, the development cycle is long. And I mentioned you\u2019ve got to have the fortitude, particularly in environments or macroeconomic cycles that would and are actually persuading others to not pursue development. We still think that that\u2019s a very good opportunity for us, as I mentioned, to go out and capture even better land sites in some cases, or with our own view and financial capabilities and basically, view of the longer-term value creation we can see through cycles like this. And in many cases, it actually can lead us to opportunities we might not otherwise see. So, that\u2019s the benefit of, again, having our deep-seated knowledge, our very entrenched development and real estate teams nationally out looking for sites and then getting into all of the complications of getting entitlements, approvals, et cetera, and then going through construction processes. Now, there\u2019s been, and we don\u2019t see any immediate relief to the amount of inflationary pressures that have come through just component costs, whether it\u2019s steel or lumber or anything tied to oil, et cetera. So, there\u2019s a lot of risk that continues to evolve into the development business. But we think that we have uniquely the ability to see through cycles, and we look and make sure that we\u2019ve got enough bandwidth and even in our own underwriting to give us very good capability of not only hitting our expected returns but hopefully exceeding them, particularly if market corrections happen through, again, these ebbs and flows of market cycles. So, we\u2019re always looking and trying to assess what the near- and longer-term market dynamics are but we\u2019ve got the fortitude to do that. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our call. And I would now like to turn the call back to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Chelsea, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the Public Storage fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. We appreciate your participation. And you may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Britney. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 4, 2023, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplemental report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially keep your questions limited to two. Of course, if you have additional questions, feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Public Storage had a very good start to 2023. We remain focused on leading the self-storage industry\u2019s digital evolution, transforming our own operating model, and enhancing and growing the portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved new milestones on several of our key initiatives, which included exceeding 60% of customers choosing to move in through our eRental online lease, eclipsing two million downloads of the Public Storage mobile app, reaching 400 properties on our customer demand-driven digital operating platform, installing solar at more than 200 properties putting us on track to complete at least 1,000 property installations within the next three years, completion of over 70% of the property of Tomorrow Enhancement Program, growing NOI by 29% across the 529 acquisition and development properties in our non-same-store pool, and driving the industry\u2019s largest development pipeline to an excess of $1 billion to be delivered over the next 24 months. We had a strong operating performance in the first quarter, particularly with existing customers performing well and same-store move-in volume up nearly 13%. Length of stays are strong and same-store revenues were up nearly 10% year-over-year. Our exceptionally large non-same store acquisition and development pool now nearly 25% of the overall portfolio continues to outperform as well. Fundamentally, self-storage is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Additionally, with the return to more seasonal patterns of demand, we are currently also seeing an uptick in movement activity that has continued into the second quarter. We also continue to find good opportunity in development and redevelopment as well, with a vibrant pipeline poised to generate growth for years to come. Our unique ability to weather economic cycles serves us well, particularly while other developers have slowed their activity due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the near macro term landscape. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to discuss acquisition market and financial performance. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. The transaction market has been relatively quiet to start the year as potential sellers feel out the macro environment, higher interest rates and the spread between buyer and seller expectations. That said, we have closed or are under contract to acquire nearly $200 million right on track for our $750 million outlook for the year. The vast majority of our acquisitions this year have been done off-market quietly. More recently, we\u2019ve been encouraged by an increase in inbounds, which are primarily small to medium-sized portfolios. We\u2019re in a great position to acquire today given our cost and access to capital advantages paired with our industry-leading NOI margins. Now on to financial performance. As Joe mentioned, we started the year strong reporting core FFO of $4.08 for the quarter, representing 16.2% growth over the first quarter of 2022, excluding the contribution from PSB. Looking at the components. In the same-store, our revenue increased 9.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. We drove strong move-in volumes up 13% during the quarter heading into our peak leasing season and the existing tenant base remained strong with length of stays sitting at records. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.6%, leading to total net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties growing 11.2% for the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up in performance of the recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter growing 29% compared to last year. Shifting to the outlook. We lifted our outlook for the year, driven by increasing our same-store revenue assumptions. While the macro environment remains uncertain, performance to date has been encouraging. We\u2019re set up well heading into the second quarter. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. Our net leverage of 3.3x, combined with $700 million of cash on hand at quarter-end, puts us in a very strong position for capital allocation as we move through the year. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Joe. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Tom. Our people, technologies, platforms, balance sheet and brand have and will be continually enhanced to create and strengthen the competitive advantages we have across the entire Public Storage enterprise. We see opportunity in the current environment and are poised to execute with focus on delivering growth and value for our shareholders. Let\u2019s go ahead and open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. Joe or Tom, I was just hoping you could speak to April trends and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand and/or price sensitivity from customers out there? Any \u2013 some of your peers have talked to some softness in March or April depending on their market exposure. So just curious what you guys are seeing across your platform. Tom Boyle : Yes, thanks for the question, Juan. As we move through the quarter and you could hear it in the prepared remarks, we saw continued strength in move-in volumes and interest into our system. And so as we move through March and into April, that trend continued. I wouldn\u2019t characterize March as weak, but I would characterize April as strong. And so we\u2019ve seen accelerating move-in volume growth as we move through what was a strong margin into a stronger April. One of the things you highlighted there was existing customer sensitivity to price. And I\u2019d also note that we haven\u2019t seen anything concerning there. Price sensitivity has been very in line with our expectations. And so against that backdrop, seeing good move-in volumes, which is encouraging in particular as we head into the next several months. Juan Sanabria : Thanks. And then just for my second question, just on the Property of Tomorrow spend, you guys have made excellent progress on deploying that capital. Just curious on the types of returns you\u2019re generating as you look at the CapEx that you\u2019ve spent and how that\u2019s augmenting growth either in the same-store or non-same store pool? Joseph Russell : So, the step back, Juan, the program has been quite well received by both customers, our employees and now that we\u2019re at a point where we\u2019re actually getting to full market completion in several of our key markets as we finish up and round out the program over the next couple of years. We\u2019re actually seeing a very good response and overall lift just to the \u2013 again, the image and the power of the brand, particularly where we\u2019ve got meaningful scale in many, many markets. So we continue to track and see the benefits from that. It\u2019s continuing to enhance our presence market-to-market. And with that, we continue to be very excited about getting the program completed. The team has done a very nice job figuring out any and all ways to optimize the amount of volume we\u2019re actually going to pull it in plus or minus a year earlier than we intended to. And with that, we\u2019ll be in a very good position nationally to have elevated the crisp and enhanced brand attributes that play well in many parts of our business. Juan Sanabria : Appreciate the time. Thank you. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Juan. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the guidance. You brought up the low end. Is that a reflection of the trends that you\u2019ve already experienced in the first quarter? Or that guided \u2013 the low end of your range was based on a full recession scenario? Is the increasing guidance more reflective of that outcome is less likely to occur? And then within this, you\u2019ve included this quote in your supplemental that suggests that the potential of revenue growth rates is wide and including the potential for year-over-year declines in revenue in the second half of the year. Is there anything that you saw in the first quarter that changes your view on that? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks for that question, Michael. I would characterize the first quarter as a strong quarter and that is really what\u2019s leading to the lift in the low end of that revenue assumption component. And so we\u2019ve talked to the strength in the first quarter you\u2019re highlighting how we characterize the wide range of potential outcomes embedded within our outlook for the year. There\u2019s still certainly macro uncertainty in the back half of the year that hasn\u2019t changed, but performance to date has been quite encouraging, which is leading to the increase in the outlook for the year. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. And my follow-up question is about the strength and the sustainability of the LA market. Same-store NOI growth was up 20% in the quarter to added 300 basis points to the overall number. Presumably, this is reflecting the rate restrictions that were lifted in February of 2022, which you lap during the quarter. But is there kind of like a second \u2013 is there a second year of growth coming from the LA market? Or have we kind of \u2013 have you kind of used up all the gain there and the gain should be more modest going forward? Thanks. Joseph Russell : Yes, Michael. First of all, LA being our largest market, we\u2019ve been very pleased by the performance we\u2019ve been able to achieve over the last year or so, to your point, where the owner\u2019s restrictions have been lifted, but it is also a market where we have a commanding presence. We\u2019ve got very good inherent demand. We\u2019ve got very good occupancies and very little new competitive product coming literally to any of the submarkets that we\u2019re competing in. So the inherent demand in the market is quite good. We think we\u2019ve got against some good traction ahead of us, certainly going into the rest of 2023 and we\u2019ll continue to see where we go from there. But we\u2019ve been very pleased by the performance of that portfolio. It is one of the markets that we \u2013 to go back to my comment about property tomorrow, we put about $75 million into that portfolio to lift it from a brand awareness standpoint, finished that a little over a year-and-a-half ago and again good timing and tie to that \u2013 being that much more prominent in the market. And one of the ways we measure the receptivity of that too is Net Promoter Scores, again getting very good reaction from customers and the brand itself is playing through quite well. So with that good demand and that good continued performance. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. You mentioned the almost 13% move-in volume across the first quarter, but move-out volume was lower, but kind of almost kept pace with the move-in volume. I was just wondering if you saw a similar trends in April as well. Tom Boyle : That\u2019s a great question, Smedes. So one of the things that took place during the quarter was we did gain occupancy as you anticipate. And so occupancy from the end of the year through March was up 50 basis points. And in April, we gained another 20 basis points. So starting to see that seasonal uplift in occupancy that will really continue here into May. And I\u2019d characterize the trajectories of year-over-year move-in and move-out growth as being favorable, i.e., as we move through the quarter, the move-out volume growth has modestly lowered and the move-in volume growth has modestly increased into April, i.e. So April was actually our best month in terms of gaining occupancy and closing the year-over-year occupancy gap on an incremental basis. So again encouraging trends here as we head into the peak leasing season. Smedes Rose : Thanks. And then I just I noticed that the late charges, the pace of growth picked up at a faster pace on \u2013 rental income. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything kind of to read into that? And have you seen an uptick in kind of non-payments or anything that would suggest some customers are under economic duress? Tom Boyle : Sure. Yes, there\u2019s two components to that line item. The one is what you\u2019re highlighting, which is that there are more customers that are making late payments this year than last year. But if you frame it over a multiyear time period, we\u2019re coming off of really, really low delinquency time periods over the last several years and remain well below 2019 levels delinquency, but you\u2019re seeing an uptick there in late payments. And then I think more interestingly, the fact that we had significant move-in volume growth also contributed there with our administrative fee that\u2019s charged to new customers when they move-in, leading to a year-over-year increase in that line item as well. Smedes Rose : Great. Thank you. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Smedes. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. Good morning out there. First question just related to investments. Tom, the balance sheet is in great shape. I think you commented that you\u2019re seeing an increase in inbound call volume from owners. Are you seeing the pipeline build? And can you speak a little bit to pricing, whether pricing seems to be moving in your favor such that we should expect to see deal flow pick up in the quarters ahead? Tom Boyle : Sure. So we have started to see or started to receive more inbounds more recently. And I do think that that\u2019s healthy. And as you know, Todd, it\u2019s traditional to have a busier second half for storage transaction volumes in the first half and we\u2019re encouraged to start to see that inbound activity. And we suspect it is going to lead to a pickup in volume as we move into the second half of this year. And in terms of the valuation as you think about the assets and where things have traded, transaction volumes have been relatively light to start the year. So I wouldn\u2019t point to a significant amount of data for us to sit here and say, that cap rates are an X or Y with significant precision. We\u2019re continuing to find good value in many of the assets and or closing that buyer and seller gap in many instances, but it remains wide in others. And so we\u2019re still working through that and anticipate to work through that through the rest of the year given what\u2019s played out with interest rates and the macro environment. To put some numbers on it, I think on the last call, we said the cap rates had moved up about 100 to 125 basis points from the lows. And I would say we haven\u2019t seen anything over the last three months that would have us direct you any differently from that. Todd Thomas : Okay. Joseph Russell : Yes, Mike. And then Todd, just a little bit more relative to the complexion of the activity so far. So Tom mentioned that we\u2019ve been doing a number of deals off-market. So as always, we are looking for those kinds of opportunities as well. There are still owners out there that are looking for an efficient clean transaction. The average occupancy of the $186 million that we\u2019ve done so far has been about 50%. So thematically very similar objective on our part where and if we can acquire properties that have upside once we put them in our platform that\u2019s going to make sense relative to the ultimate yields that we\u2019re likely to achieve from those assets. So we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to continue to see those kind of opportunities going into the rest of the year. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then how would you sort of compare and contrast the U.S. versus non-U.S. opportunity set today? And then also would you \u2013 just given the amount of development activity that\u2019s taken place over the last several years and some of the tighter lending environment that we\u2019re seeing today, would you consider building out a structured finance program at all to be a financing solution for borrowers, but also as a way to maybe expand the platform through third-party management and build a future investment pipeline? Joseph Russell : Okay. So, yes, a couple of questions or more on that statement. So first of all, from an international standpoint, I would say, consistent with what we\u2019ve spoken to for some time, which is we\u2019re well equipped to consider and evaluate outside border opportunities, we continue to do that, nothing to speak to as we are here today. But again, that\u2019s part of the overall mining that we\u2019re doing both inside and outside borders. But we\u2019ll see how that plays out over time. Clearly, there\u2019s been far more in border opportunities over the last three or four years. And maybe to a tight \u2013 another part of your question is the fact that part of the reason for that is the amount of development that\u2019s come into the cycle has been done by owners that have no intention of being long-term holders of those assets. So that continues to be a good breeding ground for us to find deals. I\u2019ll let Tom talk about thoughts around going into any kind of lending platform et cetera. Tom Boyle : But yes, I\u2019d maybe take a step back and comment on your question around the lending environment because if you think stepping back the lending environment, it certainly gotten more challenged for many developers at this point. It could lead to lower new supply heading forward. So we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. In terms of our participation in other parts of the capital stack, we continue to find very good value in the equity portion of the capital stack and have been deploying capital there consistently over the last several years and have found that to be a good risk adjusted return. And I note in addition to that, we have made some lending investments with some of our partners on a smaller scale. So something that we\u2019re considering as part of our wheelhouse as we move forward. Todd Thomas : All right. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Joseph Russell : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Keegan Carl : Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe first here, just any more color in your development pipeline, particularly those assets are completed from 2018 to 2020. It seems as if occupancy levels are below your portfolio average by decent margin, but yet they should have stabilized at this point based on your press release commentary. So just any sort of color on what\u2019s driving and if it\u2019s maybe market specific would be helpful. Tom Boyle : Yes, I\u2019d characterize as the performance of those assets to be pretty strong, right? I mean anything we delivered over that time period has benefited from really strong demand drivers. And frankly, they\u2019ve been exceeding our expectations. Your comments around occupancies, I think, some of those vintages are a touch under 90%, but they\u2019ll certainly stabilize above 90%. One of the things that I\u2019d remind you is that occupancy is only one part of the equation of stabilization and rental rates is certainly the other. And we\u2019re seeking to maximize revenue from those pools of assets the same way we do our same-store pool. So occupancy will ultimately get over 90%, but I think more importantly the rate growth there has been exceptionally strong and likely has several more years of strong rate growth compared to the same-store pool from that group of assets. And you can see the yields that we\u2019re achieving there. It continues to reinforce the strong risk-adjusted return of that program and it leads to our increase in desire to continue to build moving forward. So the development pipeline now is sitting over $1 billion as we seek to grow that program. Keegan Carl : That\u2019s helpful. And then one thing I noticed in the supplement, just your commentary on credit card fees stood out. Just kind of curious, is there a way for you guys to charge a higher rate on those using credit cards to offset that? Or do you just now want to take the risk of them bulking given those people on auto pay tend to be better customers? Tom Boyle : Yes, I\u2019d say for the most part the increase in credit card fees relates to the increase in revenues and that\u2019s by far and away the contribution. So as revenues increase, you\u2019re going to see those payment processing fees go higher. From an operational standpoint, we do spend time thinking about ways to incentivize our customers to use attractive payment patterns for them, but also one that may be cheaper for us to process. And so that\u2019s an ongoing kind of year in and year out attempt through different operational methods. But to your point, we love to move people in and achieve that auto pay and ultimately it\u2019s much more important to achieve that move-in than it is to focus on the payments process. Keegan Carl : Got it. Super helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I'm sure you guys are disappointed in the outcome with Life Storage, but does that sort of change kind of your view at all about kind of large-scale M&A? Or do you feel like this kind of puts pressure for you to find other transactions of size to kind of keep your lead in the industry? Joseph Russell : Yes, Steve. Clearly, we are well positioned to continue to grow in all different shapes and sizes. And we feel every bit, if not more, confident that opportunities will continue to arise going forward. So we're very focused on that. We are looking at many different alternatives going into future opportunity scenarios. But we feel that, again, the reset to whatever degree happens in the sector by virtue of the LSI and ESR combination. At the end of the day, it doesn't change the landscape from a competitive standpoint. One of the things that we've learned over time scales one part of efficiency and optimization, but many other things play through as well, that we continue to invest in that lead to our industry-leading margins, the things that we've done to enhance our own brand, the effectiveness of the presence we have market-to-market, and we feel very confident we're in good shape going forward, and we'll continue to make those investments. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then, I guess, secondly, on development, we continue to hear that development should be coming down given all the challenges in the lending environment. You guys have remained, I think, active I'm just curious, are you sort of changing kind of how you guys underwrite development today? Have you changed your hurdles? Are you changing anything in the, I guess, the framework and the way you evaluate new development projects? Joseph Russell : Yes. The \u2013 first of all, development is a long game, right? So we're typically looking at scenarios that \u2013 well without question, go in and out of all kinds of different ranges of economic cycles, et cetera, when you're thinking about total time periods to actually put a property to a point of not only opening, but stabilization, I mean you can easily be at a five-year plus mark asset to asset. So that I think, is a good headwind, particularly in this environment where, again, many owners are seeing different headwinds around cost of capital, availability of capital, component costs. I mentioned the amount of timing it takes to get approval, city-to-city, and we've been talking about for some time is far more difficult today than it's ever been on that front. And literally almost everywhere. I can't even name a market where it's easier to develop today than it was one, two or three years ago. So you've got to be, again, ready to work through those kinds of demands or those kinds of factors, those kinds of risk components. We feel very well suited to do that. In this environment, where we're actually seeing the opportunity to pull more interesting properties into our own pipeline that potentially have far less competition from a land standpoint or even a repurposing standpoint. So the team is working hard, and we're finding some good opportunities. I'll let Tom talk a little bit about how our underwriting process play through as well. But that's something that always is reflective not only the current environment, but the long-term environment. Tom Boyle : Yes. And just to piggyback on that, I think we're consistently looking to try to improve our underwriting processes year in and year out. And if you recall at Investor Day, our data science leader talked about some of the tools that, that team has helped develop with \u2013 for use with our development and acquisition team. Those processes continue to be underway. We try to use our wealth of data internally to give us advantages on picking those sites and adding in new development. So underwriting process is consistently evolving in a positive way. In terms of hurdles and the like, obviously, we do with acquisitions as well as development and think about what our cost of capital is and evaluate that in the context of the returns that we expect on new capital allocation. But I'd point you to a relatively consistent trend, which we said that we're seeking to build new sites that will generate a yield on cost of circa 8% plus at delivery, and that's not significantly changed over the last several years. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Joseph Russell : Thanks, Steve. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We will take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. Did you guys provide an update on April moving rates? Sorry if I missed it. Tom Boyle : No, we didn't. The way I'd characterize move-in rents, and I think this is the first question on move-in rents on the call, which maybe a record in terms of depth before we get that question, but move-in rates across the sector have been lower. And I think that's been pretty well documented. Move-in rents in the first half of the year, we anticipate to be down more significantly than maybe the back half of the year given the comp scenario that we've been discussing with the first half, really tough comps versus last year in the second half, easier comps. And so as we move into the second quarter, we anticipate moving rents, and we're seeing that in April to be down in that kind of upper single digits to low double-digit type ZIP code. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Great. And how many stores do you have right now that are managed fully remotely without people? And are those \u2013 any kind of shared characteristics are those usually just smaller stores in tertiary markets or in different places as well? Joseph Russell : Yes, Ki Bin. I would tell you there's a broader context of the way we're approaching the whole concept of \"remote.\" One of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, is we've now got 400 properties on what we call customer-driven technological platforms, which includes a piece of what you might consider a property to be remotely managed. A misnomer on remote is remote also requires and every property still requires some level of on-site personnel. What we have done in a broader context is continue to test and now deploy pretty effective technological, predictive and data sources that we have to put people in the right places based on property activity, the amount of demand that's likely to come through the patterns both on a weekly, daily and monthly and even quarterly basis. So with that, we can really take even that baseline concept of remote to a far different level, which can work in suburban or remote areas. It can work in more dense areas. It can help us optimize the amount of necessary on-site labor. And this is all built around something that's first and foremost, which is actually maintaining or improving customer service. So there's a whole range of different components to that platform, some of which include kiosks for instance, some of which include the way that we interact with customers through our customer care center. And then another leg of that whole puzzle is a very effective time and presence from a face-to-face Public Storage employee. So all of those things are being optimized piece-by-piece, and we've done some very interesting things, and we have a lot more to come. Very excited about that part of the business. Ki Bin Kim : And so you said 400 properties, you have about 2,900. I guess, can you apply to all? And if you do, like does the FTE go from 2 to 1? Or I am just trying to understand the impact overall? Joseph Russell : Yes, yes. It's the roadmap we're on. I wouldn't say it's pure enough to say each and every one of the 2,900 properties have the same impact from the platform, but the great part about our overall strategy as there are components to this. So you can optimize FTE based on, again, what size of property you're dealing with, what historic level of either staffing or presence you'd have from an employee standpoint. And then Tom, you can talk a little bit about some of the economic benefits that we're likely to continue to see. But the great thing about this, like I said, far deeper than just remote because it can apply to many different types of assets, and we're excited about deploying in that many more parts of the business. Tom Boyle : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that Ki Bin is in our Investor Day presentation, we did highlight our objective to reduce labor hours and get more efficient with labor hours through the specialization and centralization that Joe is speaking to in reacting to customer demand. And the target we set is for a reduction in labor hours of 25%. We'll achieve that this year. In fact, we think that there is more upside from here. So just another component of how we're seeking to get more efficient and drive our industry-leading margins higher. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Joseph Russell : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. I was wondering, are you seeing any signs of like the degradation of length of stay for your lower-term customers that have been there over a year or two? Joseph Russell : Yes. I mean, we characterize the length of stay is sitting at records in our prepared remarks earlier. And so generally speaking, while we have seen move-outs increase in trend back towards 2019 levels, the length of stay of the overall platform continues to be really strong. The portfolio now \u2013 the average length of stay of the tenant base today is over 36 months and has been sitting around that sort of ZIP Code for the last several quarters. In terms of the longer length of stay customers themselves and how they're behaving, they continue to behave quite well. And on a year-over-year basis, the percentage of customers greater than two years is actually higher than where it was last year. So continuing to demonstrate the strength of that component of tenant base. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is open. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Maybe just another one similar to the development topic. But can you just remind us what percent of the portfolio would you say has true expansion opportunity? Joseph Russell : Yes, Spenser, I don't think we've ever characterized that as a specific number. What leads to those kinds of expansion opportunities are several factors. We have hundreds of properties that have been developed, say, 30, 40 or 50 years ago that in those periods of time, a traditional properties you might have a much larger amount of acreage and would typically have what we would call our Gen 1 product simple, single-story drive-up product. There are many opportunities within the portfolio to potentially acquire different and higher levels of FAR to magnify the size of those properties. And frankly, many of them are in great locations, some of which we get far better customer demand once we actually even make the property that much bigger. So there's a sizable set of those types of assets. Time and the effort that goes into that to be quite complex. Many cities won't allow us to do certain expansions of that magnitude. Some that may open the door to that, actually, they will put you through a multiyear process. That, again, you've got to work through very diligently. So we've got a number of those efforts in play as we speak. Another thing that we have at hand in many assets, for instance, is either some additional excess land or parking area that, too, can be developed or expanded into, again, a more modern facility as an extension of what's already on the property. So there's a whole range of things that we're continuing to evaluate on that front, but the good news is by virtue of our very consistent investment processes now for several decades. We've got amazing sites. And with that, in many areas, properties that have far different demand and better demand dynamics when they're originally built that could fit very well to, again, the opportunity going forward. Today, the $1 billion development pipeline, plus or minus about 50% of that is actually tied to the kinds of sites I'm speaking to. And the team is going to continue to work, to monetize and unlock those opportunities as we go forward. One of the great things about our development team is they can wear both hats. They can work on ground-up development as well as expansion development. We're doing that like-for-like, clearly in many of the markets that we're looking for expansion. Spenser Allaway : Okay. That was really helpful color. And I was also just wondering, just given the fact that there has been a lack of larger portfolios in the market, has there been any increase to the personnel dedicated to sourcing or underwriting acquisitions just as I would imagine, the deals are a little bit more granular, excuse me, than normal. But it sounds like from what you just said, your personnel are very dynamic and perhaps can wear multiple hats. Joseph Russell : Yes. To that point, maybe just to give you a little context. 2021, to your point, it was an unusual year where we did a couple of very large unusual transactions. And again, the flip side of that, though, is that was only half of our volume of the $5.1 billion that we did. The other half was dedicated to what's very traditional, either single asset acquisitions or much smaller portfolios. We've got a deep-seated team, very knowledgeable, very well placed relative to knowledge of markets, knowledge of owners and the kind of dialogue that comes with that from a relationship standpoint, has been and will continue to be very important for our efforts to grow the portfolio. As Tom mentioned, about half \u2013 or more than half, excuse me, a lion share of the acquisition volume that we've done in 2023 has come from off-market transactions. So part of that is just, again, as I think you're alluding to, we've got the right team in place to go out and engage. We've got a great reputation as a preferred buyer, and we're going to continue to leverage that. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Joseph Russell : Great. Thank you. Operator : It appears we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Britney, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 3, 2023, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports, and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. [Operator Instructions].  With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. As demonstrated by our second quarter performance and raised outlook for the year, Public Storage continues to maximize its competitive advantages across our platform with several key factors driving positive results, including a better-than-expected macro environment with higher odds of a soft landing; increased rental activity from our needs-oriented customer base; and execution across all aspects of our industry-leading platform. We are built to operate in all macro environments and we are proving just that. Let me highlight three specific areas. First, we are driving record year-over-year growth in customer move-in volumes. Move-in volume growth has accelerated throughout the year, up nearly 14% in the second quarter. We have closed the year-over-year occupancy gap from down 220 basis points at the end of March to down 160 basis points at the end of June. We have the right team technologies and analytics to determine the appropriate mix of marketing, promotions, and rental rates to meet customer expectations in the current environment.  Drawn by our leading brand and enhanced digital customer experience, self-storage users are clearly choosing Public Storage. These trends support our raised outlook along with the easing of difficult year-over-year comps as we move through the second half of the year. Second, we are growing our portfolio amidst broader market dislocation. Last Monday, we announced and fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage acquisition in a matter of a few hours. This is something that very few companies could do today and separates Public Storage as the acquirer of choice within our industry. We have the strongest balance sheet and the lowest cost of capital, both of which were highlighted by our rapid execution on the Simply Self Storage transaction. With the Simply Self Storage acquisition, we are excited to combine our respective strengths as we integrate their portfolio to ours and achieve significant operational enhancements immediately and into the future. As an example, under our platform, the $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio acquired in 2021 has seen significant operating margin improvement of 1,100 basis points from 72% to 83%. As we do with all of our acquisitions, the entire Simply Self Storage portfolio will be rebranded to Public Storage in order to maximize the benefits and value of our iconic brand and platform. We expect to stabilize the portfolio at a mid-6% nominal yield by year three. Third, we are well positioned for continued strong execution and growth across the company. From an operating perspective, our digital and operating model transformations are proving to be significant win-win-wins with result to exceeding expectations. Customers benefit from having robust digital options at their fingertips across the entire journey, finding a unit, renting a unit, moving in, managing their account, and navigating the property when on site. Our proprietary digital ecosystem will continue to be a primary reason that customers choose us with more than 2 million PS app downloads and over 60% of customers renting through our online leasing platform today.  Additionally, public storage team members benefit from being able to place even more focus on our customers, and for those that excel, the transformation has enabled us to create new pathways for career advancement. And our financial profile benefits as well. We are putting these digital tools in the hands of our customers and employees for convenience, combined with in-person on-site customer service when and where it's needed. The result is a better customer and employee experience and a higher operating margin. From an external growth perspective, our industry-leading NOI margins, multifactor in-house platform, access and cost of capital, and growth-oriented balance sheet put us in a unique position. So far this year, we have secured $2.5 billion worth of properties. We will have also delivered $375 million in development by year-end and have a pipeline of more than $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next two years. Our advantages enable us to acquire and develop when others can't. We have a strong appetite for more with a matching ability to execute.  Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. As Joe highlighted, we sit here more than halfway through the year with both our year-to-date performance and updated outlook better than we expected. Core FFO per share was $4.28 for the second quarter, representing 11.5% growth year-over-year, excluding the contribution from PS Business Parks. Looking at the key components for the quarter. Same-store revenues increased 6.3% as we drove record move-in growth. Our existing tenant base continues to perform well, and these trends continued into July with the year-over-year occupancy gap narrowing to 130 basis points at month-end. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.2%, leading to 6.6% stabilized same-store net operating income growth at a direct operating margin exceeding 80%.  In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities continues to be a standout, with net operating income increasing 20% year-over-year. These 544 properties and more than 50 million square feet comprise 25% of our total portfolio and are an engine of growth. And this pool will grow further with the addition of the Simply Self Storage acquisition. Shifting to guidance. We once again lifted our outlook for the year, primarily driven by a 50-basis point increase to the low end of our same-store revenue growth guidance, reflecting outperformance to date and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We also lifted our non-same-store NOI expectation by $40 million at the midpoint to primarily reflect outperformance and improved outlook and also to incorporate the impact of the Simply acquisition. Interest expense expectations increased accordingly. Our outlook for the non-same-store pool beyond 2023 improved as well. We lifted our expectations for incremental NOI stabilization from $80 million to $190 million to reflect outperformance to date, stronger future expectations, and the Simply acquisition. And last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock solid. We refinanced our untapped line of credit in June, tripling its size to $1.5 billion, and as Joe mentioned, fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply acquisition in the unsecured bond market immediately following the announcement. We're well positioned with a strong appetite for growth, coupled with the ability to execute upon the opportunity.  Now I'll turn the call back to Shelby to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The guidance for the full year implies a pretty material slowdown in the back half of the year with potential for same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth to turn negative in the fourth quarter. So, what would you have to see from the input of revenue growth, like occupancy, move-in volume, street rates and ECRIs in order to hit the middle and bottom range of the guidance, and if you see these as realistic or conservative scenarios? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Michael. It's a good question with lots of components. So maybe taking a step back, we've been consistent throughout the year providing investors and analysts with a range of\u2026 [Technical Difficulty] in terms of the different components of the outlook, I've been consistent that the upper end of that outlook encapsulates an environment where we experienced a soft landing. And as we move through the year, the probability of that soft landing has increased. As we think about the assumptions that are baked into the lower end, that is more of a tougher macroeconomic environment. And in particular, we're assuming [Technical Difficulty] I think about the midpoint. The same-store growth moderates but starts to stabilize. In that midpoint outcome, it does encapsulate a negative outcome in the fourth quarter for same-store revenue growth. But again, easier comps help and start to stabilize. And from an overall FFO standpoint, the midpoint is certainly aided by continued standout growth from the non-same-store pool of properties there as well. So again, a range of outcomes embedded within our out. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Please stand by. Your conference will begin momentarily. Thank you for your patience in holding. To our site on hold, we appreciate your patience and ask that you continue to standby. Your conference will begin in a few moments. Ryan Burke : Hi. Shelby, this is Ryan Burke from Public Storage. Trying to get through to you to resume the call. Are you hearing us? Operator : Absolutely. Yes, sir. You're coming in loud and clear, and your conference may continue. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Shelby, and apologies to everybody if you're hearing us. We've had some technical difficulties. We're hoping that we're through those at this point. Shelby, if we could go back to Q&A, we would appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open.  And I'm hearing no response, we will move to the next question. We'll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is open.  Hearing no response, moving on to the next question. We'll take our next question from Samir Khanal with Evercore. [Operator Instructions]. Samir Khanal : Hi, good morning, Jo and Tom. Can you talk about what you're seeing in July, maybe move-in rates and demand trends, and if anything, on the customer side, given some of the price increases? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Yes. Great question, Samir. So, in July, we've seen largely continuing trends from the second quarter. So, as we think about the different components of customer activity, we saw a good move-in volume growth, call it, 7% or 8% above prior year. Move-in rent's down a similar kind of down 14% as we sit here in July. Move-outs have begun to moderate, again, as we talked about. Easing comps as we move into the second part of the year. Move-outs are up about 4% in July, ultimately leading to that occupancy gap closing, again, as I mentioned earlier, down to -- down 130 basis points at the end of July. There's a couple of points I'd highlight about July. One is we've talked about how comps in the first half of the year are more challenging. And I think from a move-in rate standpoint, we do believe July is really the point in time where those comps are the most challenging and should ease up from here. And so, as you think about the different pathways for growth going forward, we're anticipating that move-in rate declines year-over-year start to moderate. In terms of existing tenant performance, continues to be quite strong. And the length of stays within the customer base, we're at records through the second quarter. Some of the activity we're seeing to date mathematically is likely to bring that average length of stay down a little bit, given the significant amounts of new customers that we're adding to the pool year-to-date. But the core longer-term customer base, be it greater than one year or greater than two years, continues to perform quite well throughout the summer here. Samir Khanal : And then just talking about maybe given the LA market is a big market for you, it was still solid. I mean, don't get me wrong but sort of like maybe decelerate a little bit from the first quarter. I know the restrictions have been lifted there. So maybe just talk around kind of the trends you're seeing in that market as we kind of think through maybe the next sort of six months to 12 months. Joseph Russell : Yes, Samir. The LA market continues to serve us well. We clearly have a very strong position here with north of 200 properties, excellent locations. We've completely rebranded the portfolio through a POT effort. And with that, we've continued even outside of lifting the restrictions that we were burdened by for over three years, we still got good opportunity to drive revenue and strong occupancy, still very good top of funnel demand. It's well documented. There's very little supply that has or will come into that market by virtue of lack of land sites, cost of new development, et cetera. So, we're well positioned and feel very confident that, that market is going to continue to perform well. Tom can give you a little bit more color on how we're looking at the horizon based on the fact that we've certainly gone through a wave of recovering, to some degree, the amount of pricing power that we did not have for that three-year period. But we still feel confident that the market itself is going to perform quite well. Tom Boyle : Yes. And specifically, if you remember, Samir, last year, we talked about 150 basis point to 200 basis points of same-store revenue benefit because of the expiration of those restrictions. This year, it's more like 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And the deceleration that you're seeing through 2023 is really attributable to the fact that this year, we're facing comps where we were playing catch-up on customers last year. And so that market is expected to continue to moderate its growth because of those comps. But overall, as Joe mentioned, fundamentals in the marketplace remain quite strong. And frankly, it's not just an LA phenomenon either, if you look at San Diego, that's one of our top markets as well. Southern California performing well through 2023 for Public Storage today. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Todd Thomas : Can you hear me okay? Joseph Russell : We can. Thank you for checking. Hopefully, you can hear us. Todd Thomas : Yes, loud and clear. I wanted to ask about the occupancy build in 2Q and -- which was a little bit more muted than it has been in prior spring and summer seasons, and it sounds like the year-over-year occupancy gaps narrowed a bit further in July, which is positive. And Tom, you mentioned July is a tough comp. But as we think about the seasonality of the business, do you think that the peak rental season, particularly this year has a little bit less weight than it has in prior years and prior cycles in your view? And does the lower seasonality in the spring and summer mean that you might expect to have less seasonality around Labor Day and sort of through fall and winter in the back half of the year? Tom Boyle : Yes, that's a great question, Todd. I think stepping back, we haven't had a typical demand year since 2019, and we could debate whether 2019 was one as well. Every year has had its unique attributes given what we've all lived through over the last several years. And certainly, 2023 is no different than that. This year, some of the factors at play, certainly the housing market is one that I would highlight. And we've been highlighting for some time the existing home sales volumes declining, having an impact on some of the seasonal demand that we would oftentimes see in a May, June, and July time period, we're not seeing as much of this year. And I do think that, that's one of the primary reasons for the difference in occupancy build as we move through the year. That said, we've continued to see very good move-in volumes, as we've highlighted already on the call. And that's being made up by renter activity by folks that continue to run out of space at home, which is also somewhat tied to people not selling their existing homes. And so, we feel good about the level of new customers that we're acquiring today but it is a different year. And then maybe to your second part of your question around how does that impact our thoughts on the second half, I think because of how the first year has played out and that demand dynamic, we would anticipate that we'd probably see a little bit less of a seasonal decline in occupancy as we move through the year, which is likely to lead to continued modest closing of the occupancy gap year-over-year as we move through the year. Joseph Russell : And just to highlight a couple of other things, Todd, the seasonality predictable components are shifting. And what you have to be in an environment like this is quite nimble and to interpret what effects or counter-affects you may have or be able to deploy as the traditional seasonality theories or events are shifting. And to Tom's point, since 2019, we've learned all kinds of different range of impacts, whether it's tied directly to housing, hybrid work-from-home environments. I can tell you maybe the one consistent predictable driver is just college, and that too got upended during the pandemic. That seems to be back so there's a little bit of movement that we think we can predict there. But the good news is with our platform and our ability to interpret changing demand factors, we're actually able to maneuver through what would be, as Tom pointed out, less predictability around seasonality, but at the same time, we're seeing very good customer demand driven by even new and additional factors, many of which seem to be deep-seated and are likely to be with us for some period of time. Todd Thomas : Okay. And so, Tom, I guess just in terms of the revised guidance, I mean, does that account for lower seasonality in the second half of the year, less move-out activity than you would ordinarily see in terms of occupancy loss through Labor Day in the back half of the year? And then the last piece here, I guess with less rental activity driven by moving activity related to the housing market, do you feel that you have sort of a healthier, longer staying customer in the portfolio today? Tom Boyle : So, first component of your question there, we're adding them up here, is yes. So, the outlook is -- does incorporate what I highlighted earlier. The second component of your question is also a good one to highlight, and that is that customers that have moved in year-to-date are exhibiting longer length of stay attributes because of what you're highlighting and what Joe highlighted around the use cases for storage. So consistently, kind of each month's cohort of move-ins are performing better than prior year, which is encouraging as you think about the tenant base and the durability of revenue heading through '23 and into '24. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jeff Spector : Thank you. I just wanted to, I guess, go through your -- the comments on record move-ins, better-than-expected first half, and tie this into some of the concerns, let's say, going back to at least last year and the follow-on weaker street rate. Like how do you explain the dynamic and how you're thinking about it? You're mentioning you're bringing in the right customers, it sounds like, through June, but private continue to compete on lower street rates. So how should we think about that dynamic? And again, there's this concern that it will eventually impact your ability to push on existing but that existing customer continues to exhibit great behavior. So, it is a bit confusing. Tom Boyle : All right. Jeff, there's a good number of parts to that question, too. Let's take them one by one. So, to your point around good move-in volume, as Joe highlighted earlier, we think the tools that we have are working quite well. We run a very granular and dynamic pricing and advertising process, and our ops team is built to drive move-in volumes, paired with our digital ecosystem that Joe spoke to. We think the customers are reacting quite well to. So, all of that, combined with our brand, I think it's certainly helping drive good move-in volumes. I think your point specifically on move-in rate, there's a couple of components there. One is, no question that the industry overall, as there's been more vacancy through last year and into this year, has lowered rental rates, and it's a very competitive environment for new customers today. We feel like, as I noted, we're getting good customers and a good volume of them, but the rents are lower than what they were in the prior year, down about 14% in the second quarter. To give you context, in the second quarter, our rents were about a couple percent above our competitors within the trade areas. So, we're largely charging what our competitors are charging in the marketplace but seeing very good volume and traction associated with that. It is certainly one of the components that drives the deceleration of revenue growth as we moved through last fall and through the beginning part of this year. And I noted earlier that as we sit here today, the comps do start to ease, and we think the July print could be the trough as we move through the year, and that's embedded in our outlook as we look through the second half of the year. But overall, that's certainly been a drag to revenue growth but should be a stabilizing factor as we move forward. The third component to your question related to its impact on existing tenant rate increases. And that's something we've been very consistent in speaking about. We like to talk about it in two components. One is how is the customer base performing. And as I've noted in prior calls, the existing customer base continues to perform quite well. So, the length of stays of the longer-term tenants, one-year, two-year-plus continue to be strong. Delinquencies are below pre-pandemic levels and they are accepting of our rental rate increases. The thing that has changed over the past two years is what it is to replace those tenants when they move out. And so that's the second component, the replacement cost of those tenants if they move. And that has certainly flipped from -- in certain markets, there was actually a benefit to replace those tenants in certain prior years. And this year, it's certainly a cost to replace, again going back to what you highlighted, which is move-in rental rates lower year-over-year. That's led to lower magnitude and lower frequency of increases through the start of 2023, but no real change there as we sit here in July versus what we would have told you in February on that point. Jeff Spector : Okay, very helpful. And if I could ask, given I'm getting a few incoming to repeat your first answer to the first question kind of on the back half guidance. I think we missed a lot of that answer. And maybe I would just try to clarify that the bottom end of guidance, does that still reflect -- it sounds like it still reflects that recessionary scenario? Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And bummer that you couldn't hear my first response, but I'll go at it for attempt number two. Hopefully, this works. So, the outlook as we move through the year, we've now raised it 2 times. And we highlighted earlier, that's because of better-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as improved outlook for the second half of the year. We've been consistent since February and speaking about the outlook as a relatively wide range of potential outcomes. And that's driven by a combination of an uncertain macro environment, which we're all still living in day-to-day as well as a consumer backdrop that is -- that continues to shift, obviously, impacted by that macro line. At the lower end of our guidance does encapsulate the potential that the Fed doesn't quite stick the landing here in the second half of the year. It doesn't have as much of an impact on 2023 as what it may have on 2024, which is certainly leading to improved outlook at the lower end. But there's certainly that possibility that the consumer weakens, longer-term length of stay customers start to vacate at a higher frequency. Again, something we're not seeing today but could play out as we move through the year and would be typical in a tougher macro environment. And a still competitive move-in environment, which the point earlier, is something that we've seen year-to-date, a very competitive move-in environment. The flip side, though, is also fair, which is we continue to think that there's a good potential for a soft landing and a continued strong performance from the existing tenant base, the easing of comps in the second half, which would lead to the higher end of that range as well. So again, a good performance year-to-date. The outlook's improving as we move through the second half, but we do still encapsulate that broad range of potential outcomes here. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is open. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Can you guys hear me? Joseph Russell : We can. Thanks, Spenser, for being patient. Spenser Allaway : No problem. So, apologies if this was covered, but marketing spend [indiscernible] up this quarter and that's understandable, given you weren't spending much in '22. But just curious if you can talk about the absolute customer acquisition costs and how does that trend -- or how is that trending, sorry, versus historic norms? Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Spenser. So, you noted clearly high year-over-year growth in marketing spend because we didn't really spend last year. I think one way to look at it that we track through time periods is the percentage of marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. And in the second quarter, I believe that was about 1.7% of revenue. And that's a good bit below pre-pandemic averages that were in the 2% to 3% range. If you think about overall customer acquisition costs are frankly attractive, which is one of the reasons why we continue to use that tool, along with the other tools in our toolkit to drive good move-in volume, and we're seeing very good response from that. So, we'll continue to use marketing spend as a component of the customer acquisition toolkit and have an ability to continue to spend there if we get good return. Spenser Allaway : Okay, great. And then you commented that you were receiving a high volume of inbound calls as it relates to potential deal activity. Can you just comment on the \u201822 assets that were acquired in 2Q and 3Q? Where do you inbounds? And then how much activity are you guys kind of seeing in 3Q outside of the Simply deal? Joseph Russell : Yes. Sure, Spenser. Year-to-date, from a sector standpoint, the amount of transaction volume is pretty similar to what we saw in 2022. So, I would tell you, to your point, there are a number of more inbound calls coming to us. Many of the owners coming into the market are looking for a different level of commitment and a surety that a close can take place. Clearly, with the lending environment not only from availability capital, the cost of capital, a number of traditional or otherwise active buyers in past years are not as active or capable as they would be today. So that gives us a leg up. As I mentioned, we are hearing, time and again, we're an acquirer of choice. We've got a very unique opportunity to continue to execute very effectively. Just as we did, obviously, on a very large scale with the Simply deal. We typically know an asset quite well in the market position. It's at -- again, have very efficient discussions with the existing owner, whether it's a one-off transaction or a portfolio. So, we're using that opportunity and we're being contacted more directly by virtue of the fact that there's much more surety of close, and we can be very effective and efficient and it's been a good window for us. So many of the deals, to your question, that came through were along those lines. We're still doing traditional marketed opportunities where the economics and the quality of the asset makes sense. One of the things that's fresh, 10 days now post announcement of the Simply deal, we are getting some additional inbounds knowing, again, the effectiveness that played through on a $2.2 billion acquisition. And that plays through, again, whether it's a one-off deal or a much smaller portfolio, that continues to be good bread-and-butter growth and acquisition opportunity for us, and the team continues to be busy. As typical this time of year, next quarter or so is typically the more active time of year for transaction opportunities, so we're going to continue to stay focused on that, and we feel we're in a very good spot. Spenser Allaway : Thanks, so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask, it sounds like from your remarks that you were able to come to a decision very quickly on the decision to acquire the Simply portfolio. And I was just wondering how you would compare maybe some of the opportunities you saw with that acquisition versus your original proposed acquisition of the Life Storage portfolio. Joseph Russell : Well, Smedes, very different processes and M&A opportunities got a whole different level of complexity and moving parts than maybe a traditional private opportunity. Speaking more directly to the Simply transaction, that was a process where it was a market or a deal that was brought to the market through their own advisory. And so, there was a process that Blackstone went through to bring the portfolio to the market. Because of its size and -- the portfolio has been in place for nearly 20 years, we knew it quite well. We had understood and studied the evolution of the portfolio, so we had very good and crisp knowledge of the portfolio going into that process that was set up by Blackstone. So again, very good opportunity for us to look at a portfolio of that size, integrate it very effectively. As I mentioned, we're about 10 days into the process right now, and we expect to close in the middle of September. By all accounts, the integration opportunity looks every bit, if not more, compelling than it was when we announced the deal. So very confident about our ability to integrate the 127 assets and the 25 properties that are in the third-party management platform. So, feel good about the ability to allocate capital of that size. In a private transaction market, this is the largest deal that's been done since roughly the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022 if you think about the timing of Manhattan Mini. But we're very confident that it's a very strong ability in our to allocate capital, get very strong returns, and integrate those assets very quickly. Smedes Rose : And then I just wanted to make sure, the $190 million of the non-same-store contribution you called out, that includes the Simply execution? Joseph Russell : Yes, it does. Tom Boyle : Yes, it does. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Smedes. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Juan Sanabria : Just curious on the investment side, and the balance sheet, kind of marrying those two areas together. You used a lot of the dry powder here on simply, and the accretion was modest kind of initially. So, just curious how we should think about what the remaining capacity is and what kind of cap rates or yield expectations going into deploying that kind of precious capital. Tom Boyle : Yes. Well, happy to take that. As we looked at underwriting the Simply portfolio, we viewed it as an attractive real estate transaction really across any way that you underwrite it or you think about the cost of capital. As we've spoken about in the past, we view things on an unlevered basis despite the fact, certainly in prior years, we've used leverage in order to acquire assets very quickly. We look at things on an unlevered basis and real estate level returns as well as basis. We view the Simply transaction as an attractive one. Your comment around accretion, we grew the asset base by about 4%, and we're anticipating growing FFO by 1%. That's a pretty good ratio. And our leverage at the time was 3.3 times. We increased it to 3.8 times, which is a good bit below our long-term target of 4 times to 5 times, which gives us still significant capacity to grow for the right sorts of transactions. As Joe highlighted, we're poised to do that. To give you context, I think post-transaction, we have over $5 billion of capacity to continue to grow towards the higher end of that long-term target of ours. So, still have a very good bit of capacity and are actively seeking good real estate opportunities to grow the platform. Juan Sanabria : Just as my follow-up, you made comments earlier that given the more modest peak leasing season experienced to date, that you would expect a softer kind of get-back or decel in the back half. But just curious if there's any thought to maybe the opposite actually holding true, that because you didn't see a steeper climb during the peak leasing season that, that portends something weaker, and whether it's the consumer or the housing that it's laying under the surface that may see an actually a bigger get-back than normal. Just curious on that -- those thoughts there. Tom Boyle : Sure, Juan. I mean, we've walked through now the range of potential outcomes, and so, we do think we have a wide range encapsulated in our outlook. My comments around our belief that we don't see as big of an occupancy decline is really driven by the fact that we didn't see the seasonal demand that typically can be a shorter length of stay. And I highlighted earlier that our customers that have moved into date have been longer lengths of stay, which supports less move-out activity through the second half of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to see how the year plays out. And we've given you some guideposts as to what that looks like throughout our outlook range and feel like we're very well-positioned to navigate through the environment in the second half. Juan Sanabria : Thank tom. Thank you very much. Tom Boyle : Thanks, man. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open.  And hearing no response, moving to the next question. We'll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hearing no response, moving to the next question. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Goldsmith : As my second question, kind of on the occupancy and kind of the churn of the portfolio through the quarter. Occupancy at the end of March was 92.8%, end of May was 93.1%, and end of June was 93.2%. But the average occupancy in the second quarter was 93.7%, which is higher than all of that. So, does that mean that there's elevated churn within the portfolio? And how do you think about the potential loss of some of these high-quality, high-rate customers that have been driving the growth of your portfolio in an environment where maybe there's a little bit more elevated churn? Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Michael. A couple of components there. One, churn is actually improving on a year-over-year basis as we move through the year. And you can see that in year-over-year move-out volume growth in the first quarter compared to the second quarter. And then I highlighted in July, the move-out volume's only up 4% year-over-year. So, continue to see good behavior from the tenant base. Highlighted earlier that length of stays from new customers that have moved in have been attractive. And so, we feel good about the customer base overall and easier comps as we move through the year on normalization of churn from that tenant base playing out. As you think about the occupancy lift and the difference between the average and the period end, that's going to be consistently the case because of how we operate the portfolio month in, and month out, our average occupancy or occupancy peaks in the middle of the month, and then we typically see more move-out activity towards the back half of the month, which lowers occupancy. That's the case month in, and month out. And so, nothing concerning there. You can interpret the lift in average and the lift in the period end as occupancy was higher through those periods, i.e., higher in June than it was in May. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. And just from the first quarter to the second quarter, same-store revenue growth stepped down by 350 basis points to 6.3%. As we move through the rest of the year, does the step-downs get smaller? And does that reflect just like the comparisons getting easier? I'm just trying to better understand the cadence of the step-down as you guys see it. Tom Boyle : Okay, good question Michael. The cadence of the step-downs will begin to ease and I think, we've highlighted that the comps really start to ease in September, October. And so, as we move through, I highlighted earlier, comps are actually quite challenging as we sit here in July and we would anticipate the comps do ease as we move through the back half of the year. And so, embedded in that range of outlooks is obviously a differing range of moderation of that deceleration rate but would anticipate that comps help, but particularly in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. Good luck in the back half. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Michael. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions] Hearing no response, moving on to the next question. We'll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Hi, can you hear me? Joseph Russell : Yes. Tom Boyle : Yes. Ki Bin Kim : Yes, thank you. So, your move-in rates increased about 5.5% sequentially going into 2Q. I'm just curious like when you look at say, whatever you want to call it, a normal year, how does that 5.5% increase compare? Tom Boyle : Yes, Ki Bin, that is a little bit lower of an increase than what you typically see. Typically, in a seasonal year, you'd see more occupancy lift, and associated with that more occupancy lift, you see more pricing power. And in a typical year, you'd see more like low teens difference between the end of the year and the midpoint of the year. And so, if you think about first to second quarter comparison, it's probably upper single digits full first quarter versus full second quarter increase. So, a little bit softer but along the same themes that we've been speaking about with a little bit less seasonal demand, in particular, in the second quarter. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And in terms of your $450 million CapEx guidance for the year, obviously, when you look back historically, it was under $300 million in 2021, and under $100 million pretty much every year before that. So, I'm just curious like how many more years of this newer and more elevated CapEx should we think about versus returning back to something that's more approaching from a historical level? Joseph Russell : Yes, Ki Bin. A couple of moving parts there. So, we're 3/4 of the way through our $600 million Property of Tomorrow initiative. We're targeting the end of 2024. It may taper in the part of 2025 to get the full portfolio completed so that spending will continue through that time period. The other additional but very effective component of that program that we're going to continue to invest on top of the easing down of just that spend tied to the Property of Tomorrow program is solar. So, we're putting more additional dollars into our solar initiatives in many, many markets. Our goal is to get north of 1,000 properties to some level of solar orientation, which would include just the property needs itself. And you may have seen yesterday, we made an announcement relative to what we're doing with community solar in certain markets. That's a program that's continued to grow as well. So, with that, Tom, you can give a little color on what we're seeing relative to outlook relative to spend on a year-over-year basis. But for those factors, we've still got a couple more years of elevated capital spend. Tom Boyle : Yes. And I think to Joe's point, the Property of Tomorrow spend, when we wrap up that program will go away. The spend on solar, we think, is a very good opportunity. To Joe's point, we're getting mid-teens IRRs on the capital we're investing in that program, and we've got a lot of opportunity there. And at the end of the year, we're targeting having solar on about 500 properties, with the expectation of getting over 1,000 properties over the next several years. So, a lot of opportunity there that will be capital spent but also with a good return associated with it. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Keegan Carl : Can you guys hear me? Joseph Russell : We can. Keegan Carl : Helpful. All right, cool. So, annual contract rent per square foot in the same-store pool is up 7.1% year-over-year. Just looking for some more color on the ECRI program. What rate increase are you sending out? And what are your plans on it for the back half of the year? Tom Boyle : Yes. Keegan, as I highlighted earlier on a question when we think about the existing tenant rate increase program as the two components of existing tenant performance and behavior as well as the replacement cost, the existing tenants continue to perform well. So, we're healthy increases to that tenant base, but the magnitude of those increases are less than the prior year, and the frequencies are less as well. But still sending increases and they're being accepted by that tenant base, which is helping to drive that rental rate performance that you saw through the first half. Keegan Carl : Is that a fair assumption then for the back half of the year that, that continues to moderate? Tom Boyle : I'd say that because of everything I highlighted earlier around rental rate comps as well as occupancy through the year, and the churn rates, that we'd anticipate it's pretty similar as what we saw through the first half. Keegan Carl : Okay. And then shifting gears to your third-party management platform. You guys added 16 net stores in the quarter. Just curious, one, what you're seeing out there in the market today. And two, on the back of extra space acquiring Life Storage, are you seeing any new customers from that portfolio come to you? Joseph Russell : Yes, Keegan. We added, actually, 23 properties in the quarter. And then one was taken out of the platform by virtue of being sold to another party. So, the program now is at 215 assets. We're still seeing a dominant factor play through relative to properties typically coming into the platform through development processes. We've got, I think, a whole host of encouraging conversations and relationships that we're developing on that side of the business. We'll certainly welcome and entertain any existing assets, and any other platform as we always do. If they're flagged in another third-party management platform, public or private, from time to time, there's some pretty unique opportunities, whether it is, as you're asking, relative to a portfolio changing hands that might have a third-party management component to it or not, but we've got very good traction in the program. We've got a very good offering, and we're seeing the opportunity to continue to grow it. Keegan Carl : Thanks for that. Joseph Russell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Can you hear me this time? Joseph Russell : We can, Mike. Thanks for trying again. Michael Mueller : Yes, I had no clue if you talked about this already. I basically dropped at 12 :40 and dialed back in because I had silence. But could you talk about the percentage of customers in place for over a year and two years and if you're seeing any notable changes to those pool sizes? Joseph Russell : No, that's not been asked. [indiscernible] question, give you some color. Tom Boyle : So, we continue to see very good performance from our longer length of stay customers, that customers have been with us for longer than two years, for instance, as a percentage of the tenant base is in the low 40s, which is up still 5%, 6% compared to what it was pre-pandemic. So, continue to see very strong composition as well as performance from that group. The newer tenants continue to cycle in. I highlighted earlier that we're actually likely to start talking about a potential that the overall average length of stay starts to moderate because we're getting so many new good customers that are coming into the platform, which are going to bring that average down. But overall, the longer-term tenants continue to be solid and a good bit above pre-pandemic norms. And the new customers that we're acquiring are also experiencing better length of stay trends on a year-over-year basis. Michael Mueller : Got it okay great thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Juan Sanabria : Hey. A quick follow-up. On the ECRI question, I just wanted to confirm, has the pace or cadence of increases declined at all year-to-date from your initial expectations to start the year or is that holding steady? Tom Boyle : Juan, it's holding steady. There's some seasonal factors which I won't quite get into, but generally speaking, on plan and consistent with expectations. Juan Sanabria : Okay, great. And then just one more, if you could humor me. So, what does the guidance range imply for the kind of fourth quarter or exit run rate? Just trying to think about the decel Layering into easier comps in the fall. Tom Boyle : Yes. So again, the outlook encapsulates the range. The low end of the range is a tougher macro environment. No question, that would likely lead to same-store revenue growth dipping into negative territory at the lower end there. At the higher end, we would anticipate that same-store revenue growth remains positive. Again, those easier comps lead to a stabilization through the second half of the year and exiting in that manner. Obviously, the midpoint is in between there. I think the midpoint does touch negative in the fourth quarter, and certainly positive in the third quarter. But again, we'll update you on performance through that range as we move through the year. We've been encouraged year-to-date on performance, and we'll continue to update you on where we end up through the year. Juan Sanabria : Thank you for being patient. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Juan. Thank you for being patient. Operator : And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Shelby, and thanks once again to all of you for your patience today on the technical difficulties. We appreciate it. We hope you have a good rest of the week and into the weekend. Operator : That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations for Public Storage. Thank you. Mr. Burke, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Ron. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 31, 2023 and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements to become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplemental report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially keep your questions to two. Of course, after that, feel free to jump back in the queue. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through a few highlights for Q3 and then open up the call for questions. Each team at Public Storage is successfully exercising our platform-wide advantages in a more competitive environment as demonstrated by third quarter performance and our raised outlook for the remainder of 2023. As we entered this year and expectedly, we saw new move-in customer demand for the sector shift lower, particularly with softening existing home sales due to the rapid rise in home mortgage rates. On the flipside, there has been solid and increased demand from new customers that are renters. They have proven to be very good customers as well, particularly from a length of stay perspective. We have the right team, technologies and analytics to determine the appropriate mix of marketing, promotions and rental rates. Drawn by these top-of-funnel tools, along with our leading brand, self-storage users are clearly choosing public storage. Our strong move-in volume, coupled with healthy in-place customer behavior has led to better-than-expected occupancy trends with our same-store occupancy gap narrowing from 250 basis points at the beginning of the year to 120 basis points at the end of September and to 60 basis points as of today. Our digital and operating model transformation continues to be a significant enhancement to customer experience and our financial profile. Customers benefit from having digital options at their fingertips across their entire journey. Our proprietary digital ecosystem is a compelling reason to choose us with over 60% of our customers running through our online leasing platform. And today, we have more than 1.4 million PS app users. And our financial profile benefits as well. We are putting these digital tools in the hands of our customers and employees for convenience combined with in-person on-site customer service when and where it is needed. The result is a better customer experience and enhanced margins, particularly in regard to labor efficiencies. We are also growing our portfolio amidst broader market dislocation. Our industry-leading NOI margins, multifactor in-house operating platform, access and cost of capital and growth-oriented balance sheet put us in a very unique position. So far this year, we have acquired more than $2.6 billion worth of properties, including the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio comprising 127 properties. As is our regular practice, every property was fully integrated into the public storage platform on day 1 and we welcomed over 250 new associates and approximately 90,000 customers. We are also ahead of schedule on reimaging the entire portfolio to public storage to ensure the maximum benefit from our industry-leading brand. We will have also delivered $375 million in development by year end and have a pipeline of nearly $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next 2 years. Since we updated you last quarter, the sharp move in interest rates has backed up the acquisition market with fewer deals likely to trade by year end, typically a busy time of year for asset closings. We are actively engaged with a full range of owners that give us confidence that some sellers\u2019 expectations will adjust as the cost of capital has clearly increased. Our advantages enable us to acquire and develop when others can\u2019t. We have a strong appetite to grow our portfolio as seller expectations continue to correct and we have a matching ability to execute. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $4.33 per share for the third quarter, representing 5.6% growth year-over-year, excluding the contribution from PS Business Parks. Looking at the key components for the quarter, same-store revenues increased 2.5%. As Joe mentioned, move-in rental rates continue to be lower for us and the industry, but we are seeing strong move-in volume along with the right mix of marketing spend and promotions. Our existing customer base continues to perform well with move-out volumes further moderating this quarter. These trends largely continued in October with the year-over-year occupancy gap narrowing to 60 basis points as of today, as Joe mentioned. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 2.8%, leading to 2.4% stabilized same-store NOI growth at an industry leading operating margin of 80%. Our largest market, Los Angeles, continues to lead our portfolio. The 214 properties in the same-store pool grew NOI by 6% on steady demand and limited new supply of facilities. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities continues to be a standout, with NOI increasing nearly 20% year-over-year in the quarter. This pool of 685 properties and more than 60 million square feet comprises nearly 30% of our total portfolio today and is the strong contributor to FFO growth today and into the future. Shifting toward the outlook, we sit here in October, raising our core FFO range once again, increasing both the low and high-ends to $16.60 at the low end to $16.85 at the high end. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remained rock solid. We are well positioned with a strong appetite for growth, coupled with the ability to execute in a dynamic capital markets environment. Rob, with that, let\u2019s please open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You continue to navigate the environment well, though the guidance implies continued deceleration into the fourth quarter for same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth with both turning negative at the midpoint. So what are you seeing in October to this point and how are you viewing how the last 2 months of the year will play out? Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Michael. Good question. So I will provide a little bit of context on the same-store revenue outlook for the remainder of the year and then specifically speak to October. So, as we have spoken to in the prepared remarks the environment for new move-ins continues to be competitive and that\u2019s persisted through the second half as we sit here in October. We and the industry are responding with lower rental rates, promotions as well as advertising. But on the flipside, we are seeing good move-in volume growth. Those tenants are staying longer than last year and our existing tenant base has been strong. When we look at the exit rates for move-in rates and occupancy to give you a sense what\u2019s assumed in our outlook on move-in rates we assume that at the midpoint move-in rents are down circa 18% at the midpoint. The high-end of our outlook assumes 13% decline year-over-year in the low-end, 22%. On the occupancy side, the midpoint assumes that we hold the year-over-year decline from September at about 120 basis points decline year-over-year. At the high-end of the range, we nearly closed the gap to last year by the end of December. And obviously, at the low-end, we go backwards on occupancy towards the end of the year. Speaking specifically to October, we\u2019ve seen, again, good volumes but at lower rates. As we look at the move-in rental rate decline on an apples-to-apples basis, move-in rents down, call it, 18% in October to date. Obviously, today, we\u2019ll wrap up the month. We and others ran some fall in Halloween sales on select units in the back half that will cause a little bit of a decline in that towards the back half of the month. But overall, seeing very good volumes. Volume is up nearly 9% in the month of October. So the tools that Joe highlighted continue to work very well. And I would point again to existing customers performing well. Move-outs were down or actually are down year-over-year this month-to-date. And the occupancy gap, as Joe highlighted, has improved to down about 60 basis points today. So we\u2019re seeing good traffic in existing tenant performance. Michael Goldsmith : Thanks for that. That\u2019s really helpful. And my follow-up question is on the existing customer. You\u2019ve talked about in the past with the existing customer, how they respond as a function of price sensitivity or you see rise or a function of price sensitivity and the replacement cost, given the pressure on move-in rates, how do you think about your ECRI philosophy heading into the back half of the year or heading into the through the fourth quarter, just given what you\u2019ve seen from the customer? And then separately, as a follow-up to the first part, is there any change in your guidance philosophy you\u2019ve been able to hold your guidance pretty flat through the year, at least the high-end of the guidance hasn\u2019t been raised as the low-end has moved up. And now you finally touched the high-end. So any change in philosophy on the guidance as well? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Okay. That\u2019s a lot, Michael. Let\u2019s step through that. So on the existing customer rate increases, I would reiterate what we\u2019ve been saying really all year, which is on the first component, which you highlighted, which is customer behavior and our expectations for customer behavior continue to be met or exceeded, frankly, as we move through the year. And so that side of the equation has been quite strong. It\u2019s been one of the drivers that\u2019s led to better performance through the year. And then the second component cost to replace continues to get more challenging. So as we\u2019ve highlighted throughout the year to date that\u2019s led to lower magnitude and lower frequencies have increased to customers. But no real change there in terms of talking points. The second component of your question related to guidance. And so we did lift the lower end as well as the higher end of our guidance range this quarter. And in February, we were pretty upfront and describe the different pathways that we could take through the year. We\u2019ve been encouraged by the pathways that we\u2019ve ultimately executed upon and are towards the high-end of that range and again, lifted the high-end this quarter. And I think I used some guideposts around the macro economy at that time as well to frame the outlook. And I think we\u2019re all somewhat pleasantly surprised by the macro economy and obviously, a strong third quarter GDP print that further reinforces the performance towards the higher end of that original guidance range. Joe Russell : And yes, Michael, one thing, just a little bit more context on existing customers. Again, we\u2019re all looking to the prints that Tom just mentioned. But month-by-month, through this year, we\u2019ve been quite and pleasantly surprised by the consistent behavior of existing customers. We\u2019re not seeing any new or emerging stress coming through the economy continues to support our customer base quite well. We\u2019re not seeing, again, any level of additive stress tie delinquencies, etcetera. So continuing to see very, very consistent behavior from existing customers, which is very good for the business. And again, assuming the economy at large continues to do what it\u2019s doing. We think we\u2019re in very good shape, again, going through the rest of this quarter and then setting up for 2024. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question Steve Sakwa : Great, thanks. Maybe first, just talking on that the transaction market. It sounds like you\u2019re maybe starting to see some sellers capitulate. I\u2019m just wondering, Joe, how have you guys changed your underwriting criteria on the revenue NOI growth side, IRR side, cap rate side? And how wide do you think the bid-ask spread is today? Joe Russell : Yes, Steve. So again, a lot of moving parts there. And as you spoke to, we clearly need to be very conscientious of change in cost of capital. One of the things that step-by-step, as I alluded to, with a very high degree of dialogue we\u2019re having with all different types of owners, the realization of a different trading market is starting to play through. Clearly, some entities may have more pressure points likely not tied to the actual performance of the asset or the portfolio, but maybe more particularly tied to any capital event that may be emerging, again, tied to the very different environment that an owner would go through to reset an existing capital structure and how to deal with that and/or different pressure points to bring a particular asset or portfolio to the market. So, we have seen the migration and the realization that the environment has clearly changed. As I mentioned, we\u2019re anticipating very low levels of trading volume between today and the end of the year, which is somewhat unusual, particularly for the fourth quarter. But what we\u2019ve been seeing with the iterative discussions with many entities is the realization that things have changed quite a bit. In our own underwriting, we have put different hurdles in place relative to those facts, which we should. So our own cost of capital has changed, and we are again seeing a difference in bid to ask, but I will tell you that gap depending on the situation of a particular owner is shifting, and we hope that too puts us in very good shape to actually transact in a different environment and very uniquely, as I mentioned, we can do this unlike most others. So the capital that we have available, the balance sheet, our ability to transact very quickly is serving us well, and we\u2019re going to continue to exercise that opportunity as we see fit relative to the types of hurdles we hope to achieve through this very different trading environment. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And maybe just to clarify a few numbers that \u2013 that Tom threw out just when you talked about move-in rents down 18%, just to be clear, you\u2019re talking about move-in rents in Q4 versus move-in rents in the year ago period. And if that\u2019s true, how \u2013 I guess, I\u2019m just trying to look at what is the spread between the move-in rents and the move-out rents because I think that widened out a bit in Q3. And I\u2019m just curious what your expectations are for Q4 and maybe moving into the first half of \u201824. Tom Boyle : Yes. Good question, Steve and clarification. So yes, I was speaking to a year-over-year metric there. And then, due to the second component of your question about the difference between move-in and move-out rates, I think in the third quarter, that differential was about 26%. And as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we don\u2019t manage that number specifically, right? So we talk about our existing tenant rate increase program being driven by predictive analytics on individual customers and units and understanding the expected sensitivity of that customer over time and how we can influence that. And on the flipside, right, we are dynamically managing rental rates. And so were trying to attract customers and maximize revenue through a combination of rental rate and move-in volumes. And so what spits out of that more dynamic at the local level, management is that differential in gap. And again, that gap suggests that we\u2019re earning good revenue on the existing tenant base that continues to perform quite well. To your question around how do we think about that gap today? Clearly, it\u2019s in a range that we\u2019ve operated in, in the past. I think the first quarter, that gap was about 24%, 25%, so not dissimilar to where we are now. You\u2019re suggesting, as we move through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter again, based on the assumptions around move-in rents, we\u2019re likely to see that gap increase a little bit more. And that\u2019s something we\u2019re comfortable operating in. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks for the answers. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Apologize if I missed this, but are you guys able to provide some color on the cap rates as it relates to the 3Q acquisitions and the acquisitions that you\u2019re under contract or have completed so far in 4Q? Joe Russell : So maybe a little perspective on how cap rates are trending Spencer. And then deal-by-deal, there\u2019s likely to be a range in the actual cap rate depending on the asset itself or the portfolio from a stabilization standpoint, etcetera. But if you kind of step back and look to where the environment was going back to 2021, we were in a range of plus 4% or so on a cap rate basis, shifted up to 2022 to 2025. This year, I would say we\u2019re at a 6 handle trending potentially to 7. So again, reflective of the change in cost of capital, Steve\u2019s question about this gap from a seller expectation standpoint, does take a little bit of time from a realization standpoint, but we do see that trend continuing. And we are using that as an opportunity to continue to find appropriately priced assets to bring into the portfolio. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a number of different situations playing through that we\u2019re confident at some point will likely trade, it just takes some period of time depending on the pressure points and the timing of a particular seller. Spenser Allaway : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then are you guys able to provide any update, if there is any, on the integration of your new tenant insurance platform? Tom Boyle : Sure. So I think you\u2019re speaking to our Savvy program. So we announced that we would be launching that program here in next month in November. And it\u2019s an initiative, we\u2019re launching the industry to offer our tenant insurance program to other operators. This really came out of our third-party management business in dialogue with some of the operators, they have continued to like to operate the portfolios themselves in our dialogue, but they have said, hey, but what about that tenant insurance piece? Can we talk about that on a standalone basis, and they were intrigued by that. As you know, we share a portion of the premiums that we collect on our third-party managed properties with the owners of those facilities. So we\u2019ve been working to streamline and simplify our tenant insurance process including making it easy to use digitally, something our customers have embraced over the past couple of years, and we think the industry can benefit from. So in that press release, we noted that we\u2019ve been working with [indiscernible], which is the largest software provider in the industry to be able to offer that same experience on their property management software, and we\u2019re going to be launching that starting here in November. In terms of the opportunity, it\u2019s obviously very early days. We\u2019re launching it next month. But the addressable market, frankly, could be larger than third-party management for those that are interested in a different tenant insurance component, but just getting started there. And I\u2019d say stepping back, it\u2019s just another way for us to create a win-win with other owners in the industry and build relationships that could bear fruit in a multitude of different ways over time. Spenser Allaway : Great. Thank you, guys. Joe Russell : Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. Just hoping to follow-up on a prior point on the ECR commentary. So has the quantum and/or pace of increases that you\u2019re looking to pass through to existing customers moderated throughout this year? And do you expect \u2013 and if not, do you expect that to happen in \u201824 at some point if the current environment continues into next year? Tom Boyle : Yes. Juan, it\u2019s moderated throughout the year as that cost to replace component has gotten more costly, right? I mean stepping back a couple of years ago, right, we\u2019re in an environment where in many markets, we had a benefit to replace, which is pretty unusual in the sector, and now we\u2019re back to a point in time where there is a cost to replace. And so as we move through this year, and frankly, as we move through last year, too, the cost to replace grew. And so on a year-over-year basis, the contributions from existing customer rate increases has declined modestly year-over-year. The flip side of that is the new move-in volume that we\u2019ve been getting really over the last year is supportive, right, because the more tenants that are coming in will receive those increases over time. And so that will benefit the 2023 back half as well as 2024, given the significant volumes of moving activity we\u2019ve seen. Juan Sanabria : And then I was just hoping you could spend a couple minutes on Los Angeles. I know you had some benefit starting last year as the rental restrictions rolled off. Where are we in that? Is that done? And any benefit that is going to wear off as we kind of roll the calendar forward a year? Joe Russell : Yes. Sure, Juan. Yes, just to step back, as you know, Los Angeles is our largest market. We\u2019ve got 229 properties here in the L.A. Basin, another 26 properties in San Diego, but as a full Southern California portfolio, L.A., in particular, we\u2019re beyond the correction or the opportunity that was at hand based on the price constraints that we had for that 3-year period. So the level of performance you\u2019re seeing now is truly indicative quality of the market and the strength of that size portfolio, the location and the overall dynamics that we see here in Southern California continue to provide, which is, again, very, very healthy levels of new customer activity, very healthy levels of existing customer behavior in a market that, again, we have a very outsized level of not only presence but a very strong portfolio. We\u2019ve talked about this to some degree, recently, but it\u2019s also a portfolio that we\u2019ve touched holistically from our Property of Tomorrow program. We\u2019ve invested $80 million plus in the assets to pull them into a very ideal position relative to curb appeal, other attributes that we\u2019ve added through Property of Tomorrow enhancements, etcetera. So all things considered the market is humming along quite well. And we think we will continue to see good activity and good performance going forward. Juan Sanabria : Just one last quick follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind. You mentioned occupancy was down 60 basis points year-over-year at the end of October. What\u2019s the absolute occupancy percentage, if you don\u2019t mind sharing that. Tom Boyle : The occupancy percentage as we sit here today, I\u2019m not sure, is directly relevant to what the period-end occupancies are going to be. Obviously, we\u2019re getting towards the end of the month. Today, we will be a move out day at many of our facilities. So I guess, I suggest that not too dissimilar to where we were in September. The occupancies are north of 93% today, but expect them to be in the 92s as we finish the business day up here. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you, Juan. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. I just \u2013 I guess I wanted to ask about the market in general, just listening to your comments and thinking about is there an equilibrium like some point where, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s national occupancy, something to alleviate the pressure on new rates? Or do you not really care because your volumes are so strong? Like how are you thinking about that as we\u2019re trying to forecast and think about the coming months into \u201824. Tom Boyle : Jeff, there is a lot there. I guess what I\u2019d suggest is \u2013 if you think about this year, right, we came into this year expecting that the move-in environment would be more competitive. And that was based on our outlook and what we were seeing, no question housing having a component of that with record last 20-year record high, mortgage rates, as Joe mentioned, that\u2019s led to a slowdown in demand. The flip side is we\u2019ve seen good activity from renters as we\u2019ve highlighted, but the move-in environment has gotten more competitive, right? Our facilities, in particular, if you rewind a couple of years, we\u2019re full. And frankly, we were turning customers away in 2021. Because we were so full and we were pushing rate. And so the combination of that dynamic and where we are now, has led to a correction. And I think in terms of moving rents, maybe an overcorrection in certain markets where the industry as a whole is reacting to an environment where the larger operators are taking their typical move-in volumes and the overall demand environment is a little softer than where it was maybe 2 years ago. But demand continues to be relatively healthy if you go back in time for self-storage, it\u2019s just nowhere near what it was in 2021. And no question that\u2019s led to declining move-in rents. And as we look at how our business has performed through this year, that has been the one notable component of the revenue algorithm that has underpunched expectations, i.e., moving rents have been lower than what we anticipated. The good thing is on the flip side, moving volumes, to your point, have been strong. The existing tenant behavior has been good, move-outs have moderated. So obviously, leading to us increasing our outlook as we move through the year. But I don\u2019t want to shy away from the fact that move-in rents have been a particular soft spot as we move through the year. Joe Russell : And yes, on top of that, Jeff, you again, need to be reflective of the three tools that we continue to speak to marketing, promotions and rental rates. Those are tools that are highly interrelated right down to a per property and per customer basis relative to the way that we can optimize the utility of each of those with the data that we have, the amount of demand, volume and knowledge that we have relative to any particular trade area. More often than not, we\u2019re typically competing with owners that have far few tools of any depth and/or ability to judge and react to any of the dynamics that Tom just spoke to. These, frankly, are tools that are deep seated. We\u2019ve used them in a whole variety of different economic arenas. Clearly, the last 3 years or so, most operators have had to rely on those tools very frequently. We\u2019re very good at using those tools. And frankly, we\u2019ve become better even over the near-term relative to our own utility of data, the knowledge that we have and we will continue to unlock relative to all the operational efficiencies as well. So we feel very encouraged that we\u2019re using those tools to not only drive top-of-funnel demand, but conversion to the move-in activity that we\u2019re reporting, and we\u2019re going to continue to keep them very sharp and active. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. Very helpful. And just one question, a clarification, please. On the 60 basis points year-over-year for occupancy, was that the end of period or the average, if it was end of period \u2013 can you state the average? Tom Boyle : For the month of October. Well, we started the month at down 120 basis points. We\u2019re finishing up down 60 basis points. So the average is right about in the midpoint there. Jeff Spector : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi, thanks. First question, I just wanted to follow-up on the last question about move-in rents. Tom, you talked about moving volumes being stronger than expected. And it sounds like you\u2019ve taken share from other operators. Joe, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that customers are choosing public storage more and more. In this environment, a more competitive environment, I guess really without sort of an increase in overall demand, even if occupancy stabilizes in Public Storage\u2019s portfolio, which I think the high end of your guidance now assumes at year-end, do you foresee the ability for move-in rents to stabilize or begin to stabilize or will they continue to drift lower until overall industry occupancy really stabilizes and maybe find a bottom? Tom Boyle : Yes. I think that there is a number of factors at play. And certainly, as I noted, we were in an environment where moving rents, you pick a market move in rents in Miami, for instance, we\u2019re up significantly in the 2020, 2021, 2022 time period, and we\u2019re giving some of that back. And I think as an industry, no question that\u2019s playing through. But as we think about the different components at play as we head into \u201824 and \u201825, housing has gotten a lot of airtime this year around its impact to demand. No question, that\u2019s a component of demand. And that\u2019s been softer. If you look at existing home sales over time, they have been in a range of, call it, 4 million to 7 million existing home sales per year. We\u2019re trading right around that 4 million today, which if you go back and look at the financial crisis or other periods where the housing market is has slowed down pretty consistent. So we worked through that decline as we move through 2023. And \u2013 so that\u2019s helpful as we think about the setup into \u201824 and \u201825 and the fact that existing home sales aren\u2019t likely to take another significant leg lower. But obviously, we will see how that plays out. The other side is renters and people that are running our space at home, there is less movement. And frankly, those are good storage customers, and they tend to have longer length of stays in some instances, in many instances. And so we\u2019ve seen that benefit as we move through this year, longer length of stays for move-ins this year and have been getting good customers, which again supports \u201824 and \u201825, supports occupancy, I think, for the industry overall. So those are all helpful as we move into \u201824 and \u201825. And I\u2019d add to that, the fact that the development environment continues to be quite challenging. Construction costs are up over the last several years, city processes continue to be challenging with understaffing and delays. And no question, cost of capital in the construction lending environment is going to lead to lower levels of deliveries as we go into \u201824 and \u201825. All of those things are helpful as we think about stabilizing rental rates in some of the markets that maybe I even characterize as maybe overcorrecting in some instances. I also think getting into the busy season next year will be quite helpful, right? We go into a time period in the spring where seasonally, you\u2019re going to see more demand. This year, we didn\u2019t have much of a season, partially attributable to the housing environment. So the comps from a seasonal standpoint next year are a little easier. And we will have to the benefit of what plays through in \u201824 to the dynamics with moving rental rates heading into March, April and May of next year. Todd Thomas : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my other question is around the development and expansion pipeline, which decreased a little bit in the quarter versus last quarter. I realize it\u2019s just one quarter, not necessarily a trend, but the environment is more challenging today. And I\u2019m just curious if that is intentional at all as you look for either rents to stabilize or greater certainty around lease-up or if it\u2019s just timing related. But really, just wondering if your return requirements maybe to start new projects have really changed at all in the current environment. Joe Russell : So yes, to again, give full perspective on the focus and the priority we continue to put into our development and redevelopment capabilities. It continues to be our most vibrant opportunity from a return on invested capital standpoint. So we think that ironically or counterintuitively, this is actually even a better environment for us to source and compete for a land sites and b, work certain properties through entitlement and development processes where others are retrenching. The lending environment particularly tied to construction loans continues to be much more constrained. In fact, with the pressure into regional banks where most of the construction lending goes on, particularly tied to one-off construction loans for self-storage, again, very, very tough hurdles for any developer to meet very differently than we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. This continues to be a good opportunity for us to compete very differently and ideally look for expansion opportunities for the portfolio as a whole. The slight reduction, Todd, to your point, was just a \u2013 that was just a one-off quarter impact from some deliveries that took place. But the team is working very hard to continue to not only operate in an environment where, yes, some of the hurdles are being adjusted, but development is a long game as well. We\u2019re dealing with multiyear processes not only to get a particular asset approved and launch from a construction standpoint, but then a number of years beyond that to get them stabilized. So in this environment, particularly, you\u2019ve got to have very strong fortitude to get through those time frames, particularly with cost of capital being very different. But we look at this as an ideal opportunity for us to continue to leverage the skills, the strong balance sheet and our knowledge market to market. The team is well seated nationally. We continue to find new and different opportunities region by region across the country, and we\u2019re going to continue to work hard to not only unlock ground-up development, but redevelopment activity as well. So it continues to be a very vibrant part of the business that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on very strongly. Todd Thomas : Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up, you mentioned expectations of lower deliveries, I think, industry-wide in \u201824 and \u201825. Is there \u2013 can you just quantify that a little more in terms of either dollars invested you\u2019re seeing in the space or a percent increase in existing supply? And are there any markets where you see outsized growth coming up for one reason or another or anywhere it looks particularly favorable, meaning like very little growth. Joe Russell : Yes. Smedes a lot of moving parts there, but step by step, and we\u2019ve been speaking to this for some time. We\u2019ve been seeing the usually difficult hurdles you go through to get projects a, approved and then b, funded and now again, with the constraints I just spoke to in the lending environment, getting them into production themselves. So statistically, we think most of the information out there is not accurate because it\u2019s not reflective of the continued deceleration in annual deliveries. From a step-by-step basis going from this year to \u201824 and likely into \u201825, we think that the pool of assets that had been predicted to deliver are probably shrinking by plus or minus at least 10% or more on a per annum basis. We had kind of ratcheted down to a delivery level nationally, plus or minus $3 billion or so of assets in the 2022 to 2023 time frame, and that\u2019s going to continue to notch down in our view based on all the constraints that I just spoke to. It\u2019s a very good thing for the industry as a whole, can\u2019t really point to any number of markets that at the moment are overburdened from a delivery standpoint outside of potentially Las Vegas, Phoenix to a degree, Portland starting to work, but a little bit of an outstretched level of new deliveries in that market as well. But frankly, the good news is the amount of deliveries that have come to the market over the last couple of years has been slower, and it\u2019s likely to continue to get slower from a volume standpoint going into the next couple of years. Smedes Rose : Great, thank you. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned that I think in the past that renters tend to have a longer length of stay. So are you seeing that in the portfolio now? Could you just talk a little bit more about where length of stay is and the changes you might be seeing? Tom Boyle : Yes. In terms of length of stay overall, continues to be quite strong. So we\u2019ve spoken a lot over the last couple of years in terms of how that\u2019s extended from, call it, 32, 33 months on average. If you take a snapshot of all of our tenants in place pre-pandemic to more like 35, 36 and that persists today. And that\u2019s persisting in an environment we\u2019re obviously adding more new tenants, which brings that average down. So continue to see strong trends there. Customers that have been with us for longer than 2 years continues to punch well above where we were pre-pandemic in the 40s as a percentage of the total tenant base and that continues to be the most stable and important component of the tenant base. Smedes Rose : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Eric Luebchow : I appreciate the question, guys. I wanted to go back to the ECRI discussion from earlier. I think you talked about higher cost of replaces somewhat moderated your ability to push through ECRIs to some degree. But does that dynamic shift at all, given you\u2019re loading more new customers now at lower rates? Can you push ECRIs harder and faster with this cohort given the cost to replace presumably for them is slightly lower than your in-place customer? Tom Boyle : That\u2019s spot on, Eric.  That\u2019s spot on, Eric. So, as we talk about the tenant base overall, right, the cost to replace has gone higher. But those new tenants that have moved in this year, right, don\u2019t have that same dynamic and are more like customers in prior years with a lower cost to replace and are likely to receive higher magnitude and frequency of increases, which is supportive as we move more customers in through 2023 into \u201824 and \u201825. Eric Luebchow : Okay. Great. And then just one last one, maybe you could touch on the cost side. You have seen marketing expenses, payroll, utilities continue to increase, especially with an uncertain demand backdrop into next year, how \u2013 maybe you can talk about how effectively you will be able to manage your costs and any cost line items that we should be aware of that will be pressure points in your NOI growth outlook for next year. Tom Boyle : Yes. So, I guess starting with marketing, right, marketing is the one that this quarter was up most notably. We continue to get very good returns on the marketing spend that we are utilizing. And that is a process that we manage dynamically at the local level in conjunction with promotions and rental rates, as Joe highlighted earlier. If you look at marketing spend over time, we have historically been in a range of, say, 1% to 3% of revenue spent on marketing. We got all the way down to 1% or so in 2021. And I think this quarter, we sat right around 2%, 2.1%. So, there continues to be a room at least from a historical lens for us to continue to increase that and see good return associated with that and we will do that. I would think about marketing spend on the expense line item certainly will create higher levels of expense growth, but that\u2019s going to be an NOI positive investment given the returns we are seeing. The other line items, utilities as well as property payroll continue to be areas that are strategic initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day continue to bear fruit. So, as we close 2023, we will meet our 25% payroll hour reduction that we highlighted at Investor Day. That\u2019s helped to offset as we have gone through initiatives around technology as well as specialization and centralization of property roles that are leading to career advancement opportunities and as well as good efficiencies and good customer experience. So, that\u2019s one side that will continue through 2024 to benefit us. And the other is our solar power programs, we would like to put solar on over 1,000 rooms. And today, we are sitting with solar. We will finish the year with around 500 of those complete and we think there is more to go there, which will help offset utility pressure. And in addition to that, be good for the environment and our carbon emissions. Eric Luebchow : Alright. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Joe Russell : Thanks Eric. Operator : Our next question is from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Keegan Carl : Yes. So I hate to leave [ph] the point on ECRI, but maybe just on 4Q in particular, when do you guys typically stop sending rates for the year? And does the current operating environment change that plan at all various historical levels? Tom Boyle : No. As I have noted, the existing customer base continues to perform as expected, and frankly, very stable versus the prior several years. which is encouraging. So, our program continues. It\u2019s part of how we manage revenues. And that\u2019s not going to change. It won\u2019t change in the fourth quarter and don\u2019t anticipate it to change into \u201824 barring any significant shock or change. So, that continues to be a strong point as it relates to the overall customer base and I wouldn\u2019t point to anything significant there. Keegan Carl : I guess just to clarify though, you are comfortable sending increases throughout the entire year. Like the quarter, you are not going to stop around the holidays. I thought that was a trend that\u2019s typically present in storage. Tom Boyle : No, we send increases throughout the year. Keegan Carl : Okay. And then just shifting gears here, so you guys obviously over on your interest income in the quarter just given the hold on to cash prior to closing on simply, just curious what a good run rate for this would be going forward. Tom Boyle : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. So, as everyone is aware, we announced the Simply transaction on Monday in July. We did the financing associated with that transaction on the same day, which was meant to match fund both the acquisition as well as the financing associated with it. In hindsight, that looks pretty good because interest rates are up over 100 basis points since that time period. But the other benefit was we obviously sat on that cash for a period of time. And believe it or not, we actually \u2013 we eked out a positive spread on that cash versus our financing costs given where you can earn on cash, about 3 basis points, so nothing to write home about. But it certainly led to both higher interest income for the quarter as well as higher interest expense because we were sitting on that cash, and we had raised it for a period of time. So, no real impact to FFO, but certainly drove incremental. And then if you think about that interest and other income line, right, you are just doing some simple math, $2.2 billion in cash and sitting on it earning a little over 5%. I think we get the numbers for 50 days of about a $15 million benefit during the quarter. So, you could think about that as not recurring. We won\u2019t be sitting on that $2.2 billion of cash in the fourth quarter. Keegan Carl : Got it. Thanks for the time guys and Happy Halloween. Tom Boyle : Thanks Keegan. Joe Russell : Thank you. Tom Boyle : Happy Halloween. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ron Kamdem : Hey. Just two quick ones. I think you guys were one of the first this year to talk about the potential of same-store revenue to go negative. And obviously, the guidance in 4Q implies that it does that and I think we could sort of use your wisdom as we are thinking about sort of next year. If I go back to that move-in, move-out spread down 26% in 3Q, which got a little bit worse, it sort of suggests that, that things are still sort of decelerating. So, the question really is, like as we are thinking about next year, is it occupancy response, is it length of stay, like what sort of factors should we be watching to get a sense of the direction of the same-store trend into next year? Tom Boyle : Well, Ron, I think there is a few things there that I will pick out and comment on. One is, certainly, we started 2023 at a point of particular strength and rents were significantly higher. I have commented on some of the positives and negatives that have played through this year. But no question, growth rates have moderated through the year. Commented on move-in rates, in particular, have been softer than expected. And I think that\u2019s certainly the case as we move through the third quarter and the fourth quarter here. Going into 2024, I am not going to speak to specifics, but one of the things that we spent a good bit of time on earlier in the year talking about this year was that comps eased in the second half because the environment started to change last year. And I would suggest that, that\u2019s not just a second half of 2023 thing. It\u2019s also into 2024 as we work through a demand environment that softened through 2023 as well as move-in rents that declined through 2023. And so for the same reasons that we discussed moderation and deceleration are easy comps in the second half of 2023, maybe we haven\u2019t seen that as much as we initially envisioned, but we have also seen the levels of performance of the existing tenants make up some of that rental rate comp dynamic. But we are still, to your point, looking at negative same-store revenue growth at the midpoint in the fourth quarter, to your point, we were highlighting that in February. Our outlook for the fourth quarter has gotten better as we move through the year. I think the midpoint now is down 50 basis points in same-store revenue. So, almost there at flat, which is frankly an improvement from where we were sitting starting the year. And to your point on 2024, I think I probably said as much as I should. And we will be providing a good bit more detail in February on the assumptions and fresh guidance for the year. Ron Kamdem : Great. And then my second question was just going back to the supply question, but instead of just like the macro forecast, do you guys have a sense of how much of the portfolio is actually competing directly with new supply high level? Is it a quarter? Is it half? Just trying to get a sense of the range of the actual assets that are competing with new supply. Thanks. Joe Russell : Yes. That\u2019s going to vary, Ron, market-to-market. There is a whole spectrum. As I mentioned, our largest market, being here in Southern California, almost no new supply to speak to other parts of the country that are well known to be the tougher markets to develop into have same and similar dynamics. I mentioned on the other end of the spectrum, we are keeping a close eye on the amount of deliveries that are playing through in Phoenix and Las Vegas. But frankly, it goes right down to a very submarket impact. And I would say it\u2019s less than and continuing to shrink below the lower number you pointed to, i.e., whether it\u2019s 20% or lower, it\u2019s definitely a factor below that. And I think we will continue to shrink, which as I mentioned earlier, is a very good thing for the industry as a whole. Ron Kamdem : Thanks so much. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think I was wondering, I know the Simply Storage deal is still pretty fresh. But wondering if you could go through whether you have started to realize any synergies and/or just go through the near-term strategies you are implementing? Joe Russell : Yes, Caitlin. I mentioned in my opening comments that our goal with that portfolio, which is to-date, our largest private transaction with 127 assets coming to us. The benefit that we saw in that portfolio is it crosses 18 different states. It didn\u2019t put any undue burden on our ops team, market-to-market. And frankly, over the last 3 years or 4 years, we have become very good at integration on a whole level of different scale market-to-market, where we have seen certain portfolios with dozens of assets, whether it was easy storage in the Washington DC market or the portfolio that we bought in Dallas-Fort Worth that again, was \u2013 again, very efficiently brought into the portfolio on a much more concentrated basis. But this portfolio from an advantage and integration standpoint was different. It was definitely sizable and we were able to deploy many of the techniques that we have used over the last few years to integrate those assets. Now, from a data integration standpoint, again, our toolkit has become incredibly strong relative to the efficiency. As I mentioned, we pulled 90,000 customers on to our portfolio overnight. That synergy continues to play quite well now that we are in the seventh week or so of owning those assets. We were able to integrate and train 250-plus new employees that came to us from that portfolio, great additions to the platform as well. So, that opportunity from a training synergy and adaptability standpoint has gone very effectively. And we are also leveraging many of the things we do day-in and day-out to drive margins. Again, with the scale that we have got market-to-market, the ability for us to see optimization, so we really haven\u2019t seen any shortfalls at all. And if anything, we have been pleasantly surprised with the continued strength of that portfolio. Occupancy is holding quite well. The transition from both customers to our platform, the transition from the branding is going very effectively. We will have that finished no later at the end of the year. We see definite inherent value to transitioning what were once blue properties to orange properties. And we are very excited about what we have got ahead of us because we think that, that portfolio as a whole is very additive to the scale that we have got across the 18 states that I spoke to. So, very pleased by, again, the tools that we have got and the ability to exercise the synergies. Tom spoke to some length this morning about many of the tools we are using right now from a revenue management standpoint, whether it\u2019s tied to new customer, top of funnel demand and/or existing customer opportunities. So, those two are different toggles that we are deploying into that portfolio as we speak and not seeing anything that\u2019s going sideways. In fact, more encouraged that things are actually even better than what we predicted when we underwrote the portfolio. Caitlin Burrows : Great. And then maybe another quick one. I know you have talked a number of different ways about the lower expected deliveries in \u201824 and \u201825, which is encouraging. So, that would suggest, you have started to see development, started slow, I was just wondering if you could talk about the magnitude of that slowdown and/or when it started, like how new is that? Joe Russell : Well, it\u2019s been year-by-year transitionary. We hit a peak of deliveries back in the 2019 or so timeframe with plus or minus, say, $5 billion of assets that were again, added the market, which actually equates to about 5% of additional inventory. And as I have mentioned, this year, it\u2019s down to about $3 billion or about 3%. We think that, that\u2019s going to notch down by at least another 10% factor each successive year between 2024 and 2025. By the time we get to 2025, we may be in the low-2% range of deliveries from an inventory standpoint. And to your point, that\u2019s a good thing and gives us a very different opportunity to leverage our opportunity as not only the largest developer in the sector, but the only public developer of assets. And we are able to do many things even more efficiently because of the scale we have got with our own development team and the amount of capital that we can sensibly deploy into development and redevelopment opportunities. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thanks. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. So, you guys mentioned that you were testing out some additional promotion activity in October, call it, a follow-up Halloween special. I was just curious, do you plan on keeping that type of promotional activity past October into November, or would those come off? Joe Russell : Yes. Ki Bin, sales are something that the company has been doing for years and years. You go back and look at pre-pandemic activities, the company started doing Memorial Day sales going back probably more than a decade ago and see good traction from that. And so around holidays, we oftentimes will run sales and get some traction and we offer discounts on select units in our markets that we operate in. And we have seen good traction on that this year. We did a more of a [ph] sale. We did a Labor Day sale. And this one, I don\u2019t know if you want to call it a Halloween sale or I think we call it a fall sale on the website, but it will wrap up today. And we see good customer demand traffic. And others in the industry do, too, the big public REITs generally run these types of sales as well. And so they are good traffic drivers, and they get the team in the field excited as well, and we see good conversion there. So, it\u2019s a part of the business that\u2019s been around for some time, and we will continue to use it as we have in the past. We didn\u2019t use them in \u201821, \u201822 because we, frankly, were too full for it to make a lot of sense, but we are back to an occupancy environment where it makes good sense, and so we are utilizing it again. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And on the debt maturities, you have a U.S. note and a euro note coming due next year. Just any high-level thoughts you can share on refinancing plan? Tom Boyle : Yes. We will plan to refinance those as we get into 2024. The $700 million U.S. note is a floating rate note and we will plan to refinance that as we get into the first part of the year. Ki Bin Kim : And assuming the spreads will be pretty similar, or should I expect that to change? Tom Boyle : It depends on ultimately what tenor we issue and the nature of the interest rates at the time. But it\u2019s our floating rate note, as I have said. So, it\u2019s at market from a benchmark rate standpoint. So, there won\u2019t be a significant headwind associated with refinancing that particular note. It will be more spreads. And we will update you on financing costs as we get into the first quarter. And frankly, that\u2019s. I mean if you look at our balance sheet overall, we obviously have a very long-dated set of financing tools, most notably the over $4 billion of preferred stock that we don\u2019t need to refinance ever, but we can refinance at our election to the extent interest rates change. And we have a very well laddered maturity profile. So, you are highlighting some refinancing we have in \u201824, we have modest in \u201825, a little bit more in \u201826. But overall, a very small percentage of the capital structure is coming due in any given year. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks Ki Bin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. Just a real quick one here. Joe, when you are talking about cap rates trending 6% to 7%, is that \u2013 was that meant to be a day one cap rate if you are buying a stabilized asset, or is that more the yield that you are looking at if you are buying vacancy and assuming the lease-up risk? Joe Russell : Yes. I mean again, that would be, in our view, a stabilized expectation would be. If you are dealing with a highly stabilized existing asset, that too, I think would be in that similar zone. There is always going to be a gap or some kind of a risk that you are going to inherit the time and again, we have been more comfortable doing that, knowing if we can buy an underperforming asset at a going in lower yield, we will be able to extract the kind of ultimate value and yield hurdle that we are speaking to. So, those are the stabilized yields that we are aiming at, Mike, as we are looking at investments in this arena right now. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments. Ryan Burke : Thanks Rob and thanks to all of you out there for joining us today. Have a great Halloween, and we will talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Partnership, for Public Storage. Thank you. Mr. Burke, you may begin. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Rob. Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 21, 2024, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, if you have more, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance, industry views and 2024 outlook. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. 2023 was a year of significant achievement for public storage amidst a competitive industry environment. The team elevated our customer experience and financial profile through digital and operating model transformation. Enhanced existing properties with over 500 solar installations and the Property of Tomorrow program. Advanced complementary business lines, including tenant reinsurance and third-party management and grew the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment. We did so while maintaining one of the real estate industry's best balance sheets, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow. Just a few of our collective accomplishments include : exceeding 3,000 owned properties and serving nearly 2 million in-place customers. Achieving an approximately 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. Acquiring and quickly integrating the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio with approximately 90,000 customers across nearly 130 properties. This was the largest private acquisition in company history. Increasing the size of our high-growth non-same-store pool to 705 properties and 63 million square feet now comprising nearly 30% of our overall portfolio. Generating record revenues, net operating income and core funds from operations. Accelerating growth in third-party property management, adding 132 properties and reaching 324 properties in total. And receiving several accolades tied to sustainability including NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, a second consecutive great Place to Work award and achieving top scoring benchmarks among U.S. self-storage REITs. The strength of our team, platform and brand was evident with move-in volumes up an impressive 9% in 2023, despite a backdrop of weaker customer demand during the year. The new customer environment remains challenging, but we have seen a degree of improvement in move-in rent trends recently. And our in-place customer base continues to perform well with average length of stay that are longer than the historic norm. We expect demand from new customers to stabilize during 2024 and the behavior of existing customers including our recent move-ins to remain strong due to clear macro conditions, including the potential for a soft landing, the potential for easing interest rates, resilient consumers, leveling home sales and strong home renter behavior. We also anticipate fewer completions of new self-storage facilities nationally reducing the competitive impact of new supply in our local markets. All in, the industry is in better position entering 2024 than it was entering 2023. The full Public Storage team is focused on exercising our competitive advantages, which include advancing our digital and operating model transformation, expanding complementary businesses and creating partnerships across the broader industry, growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management, and funding innovation and growth today and into the future with the industry's best balance sheet. All of this adds to the growth of our business over the near, medium and long term. And it comes at a time with the potential for further stabilization in the move-in environment, existing customers exhibiting strong behavior and an outlook for new competitive supply that is clearly in our favor. With good trends in customer demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. On to financial performance, we finished the year reporting core FFO of $4.20 for the quarter and $16.89 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range representing 1% growth over the fourth quarter of '22, and 8.3% growth for 2023 overall, excluding the impact of PSB. Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '22, at the higher end of our expectation. That was driven by better move-in volume and move-in rate performance. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 5.1% for the fourth quarter, largely driven by increases in marketing spend to support that move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 50 basis points in the quarter. Meanwhile, the non-same-store NOI grew 31% and 25% for the fourth quarter and '23, respectively, demonstrating the continued strength of our lease-up and non-stabilized assets. Now turning to the outlook for '24. We introduced 2024 core FFO guidance with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. As Joe mentioned, we entered the year more encouraged than we were last year at this time. We've seen the industry work through the declines in new customer demand from the peaks of 2021. We're anticipating that new customer demand stabilizes in 2024 as the macroeconomic picture becomes clearer. That paired with a consistently strong consumer and lower new competitive new supply. If we look at the same-store outlook for '24 specifically, the midpoint calls for revenue on par with '23. Similar to last year, move-in rates continue to be the biggest variable in the forecast heading through 2024 as well. We're anticipating at the midpoint case that move-in rents lap easier comps through the year, and crossed zero on a year-over-year basis towards the end of the summer. And occupancy results down 80 basis points, which is roughly on top of 2019 occupancies as we sit here today. Our expectations are for 2.75% same-store expense growth driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of a decline of 90 basis points. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2024, growing from $370 million of NOI contribution in '23 to $505 million at the midpoint and will grow from there in future years. In addition, embedded in the outlook is incremental acquisition and development activity, $500 million of acquisitions, and we plan to deliver a record $450 million of development in '24. Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains solid. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $400 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position heading into 2024. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : I was wondering, Tom, if you could talk a little bit about the ECRIs that are maybe embedded in the high and low end of growth and how those may be compared to the ECRIs that you achieved in '23. Tom Boyle : Sure. Happy to add that color, Steve. I think as you know, I'd like to speak about existing customer rent increases as a combination of customer price sensitivity as well as the cost to replace that customer if they vacate upon receiving a rental rate increase. And as we look at in 2024, there's a couple of things at play here. One is, as we enter the year, right, demand is a little weaker, we'll give you a January, February update here shortly, where move-in rents are down year-over-year as we start the year, similar to how we finished in 2023, that's going to lead to higher replacement costs through the first part of this year. That's going to be a little bit of a drag to ECRI performance. The flip side is, Joe spoke to the strength in move-in volumes that we experienced through '23. Those new customers are going to be eligible for rental rate increases, which will lead to more contribution from the volume of increases that are sent this year. Such that at the midpoint case, we're looking at contribution overall, pretty consistent with 2023 with those two pieces offsetting each other. In the high-end case and low-end case, a little bit better price sensitivity in the high end and a little bit worse than the low end. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then on the expense growth, can you maybe just talk about what's embedded for marketing and sort of how you're thinking about that? I guess, we were a little surprised that expense growth overall was coming in kind of at $275 at the midpoint. But just what do you have baked in for marketing just given the still somewhat challenging demand environment. Tom Boyle : Yes. So as I noted in my prepared remarks that the key drivers of expense growth are property taxes and marketing. So I will note, property tax is our largest expense line item. We do anticipate to be up 4% plus or minus, which is a contributor. And then on marketing expense, taking a step back, we increased marketing spend through the year in 2023 and saw very good returns associated with that. The fourth quarter, our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.5%. And as you've heard from me in the past, being in that 1% to 3%, 1% back in 2021 when demand was really, really strong and back towards 3% when you go to a more typical operating environment, pre-pandemic, is a comfortable place for us to be. And so the first part of 2024, we're going to be lapping comps that will lead to year-over-year growth levels that are higher, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter and then we'll evaluate as we go from there. But we're comfortable in the ZIP Code and continue to see a very strong return on that advertising dollar. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : You finished the year with 80 basis points of same-store revenue growth in your guidance for the upcoming year ranges from down 1% to up 1%. So presumably same-store revenue growth is going to dip before it kind of rebounds and that goes in line with the -- I think, some of what you've been saying with the -- with your expectations of street rates. So -- how much of -- in the midpoint of your guidance, how much of a dip are you expecting? And when are you expecting trends to kind of inflect better through the year? Tom Boyle : Good question, Michael. So there's a couple of components to this question that I'll respond to. The first is, as we look at our operating metrics, our operating metrics are starting to improve, right? We talked about occupancy closing the gap as we move through last year, and we finished the year with occupancy down 70 basis points compared to down 240 basis points when we started '23. If you look at move-in rent trends, move-in rents on a year-over-year basis decelerated through the year. In the fourth quarter, they were down 18%. Throughout the quarter, but as we noted in our January update, they improved to down 11% in December. Looking at January and February, they're down in that same 10%, 11% sort of ZIP code. So, that improvement has been lasting. And as you heard through our outlook, we anticipate that to continue to close as we move through this year. I highlight that because operating metrics tend to lead financial metrics, meaning that as we're talking about some of these operating metrics improve, it will take several quarters to see that in financial metrics. And so, if you think about the shape of the curve and the description of the midpoint case that I gave earlier, it would imply that to your point, we're going to see some deceleration through the first couple of quarters of this year. But then the second derivative, the rate of change of growth is going to flip positive in that midpoint case in the second half and you're going to see some reacceleration in the financial metrics, again, lagging those operating metrics in the second half. The second component of the question that I just highlighted is, we're already seeing that in certain markets. And so if you look at the Mid-Atlantic, for instance or Seattle, markets that maybe didn't have the high highs in 2021, but have been solid performers. We're actually seeing those accelerate as we sit here today in the first quarter and would expect those high, high markets, the Floridas, the Atlantas, for instance, to take a little bit longer to find that turn given how high their high was. But we're already seeing some of that turnaround in some of our operating metrics today. Michael Goldsmith : And my second question, it's a multi-parter, but it shouldn't be too intimidating. You comment in the that softer that -- you say, you expect industry-wide demand from new customers. To stabilize this year due to improving macroeconomic conditions. So one, are you seeing that today? Two, can you kind of provide an update on where the move in rent were in January and to the extent that you're able to provide insight into February? And then three, the -- you've talked about moving rents crossing the zero. How positive, if that momentum has continued -- how positive could move in rents be as we kind of exit the year? Joe Russell : Okay. Apologies accepted, but you took some liberty there, Michael, but we'll address your question. All right. So let me start with consumer strength and what we continue to see in the portfolio that's been trending to a clear advantage, even with the performance we saw quarter-by-quarter in 2023. The consumer activity, first of all, in existing customers, as I've mentioned, has been quite strong, and we're really not seeing any on the margin evidence that that's likely to change even going into what we've seen through almost two months of this year. Balance sheets are quite healthy. Payment patterns are still better than they were pre-pandemic. We're not seeing any undue or new stress evolving into customer activity. The acceptance of our ongoing revenue management tied to existing customer rate increases. We have a very active engagement process with existing customers that guides us to the tolerance and the level of activity that we're pushing through on ECRIs, that too has not hit different levels of either areas that we've become more concerned about. In fact, it's validating many of the things that we've already talked about relative to the performance of existing customers and our confidence that that's likely to stay with us, even coupled with what Tom just mentioned, indicating in certain markets, where you've actually seeing the -- some good percolation taking place. That ties clearly to the kind of activity from a new customer demand activity. We're having to work harder as we did all through 2023 with a variety of tools that we have. They're quite good. In fact, they continue to get much better. We are very confident market to market with our scale and the knowledge we have market to market. We have the right tools. We have the right brand. We have the right technologies to continue to pull customers to our platform, and we're going to continue to leverage those going into the next several months. With the anticipation, as Tom mentioned, that by summer or late summer, we're going to start seeing the residual effects to the positive from all those efforts. And then Tom, you can tackle if you choose to, Michael's additional questions. Tom Boyle : So Michael, I'll just maybe take a step back and talk a little bit about how we thought about the macro environment in our guidance. So last year, on this call, we spent a good bit of time talking about the macro environment. And we did couch the guidance range last year in macro terms and that we viewed it as appropriate given the landscape at the time. At the time, 65% of Bloomberg economists were expecting a recession during the calendar year, for instance, and we thought it would make sense to provide the investment community our assumptions of what that could potentially look like within our guidance range. Clearly, as we move through '23 that recession outcome became less probable. And as such, our financial performance proved out to be towards the higher end of those expectations as we move through the year. This year, we are not capturing the range in terms of macro. And as you think about the midpoint of the range, we're not assuming that the macro environment needs to improve at the midpoint range, but more around the lines of what Joe was speaking to and what we're seeing today. So I hope that's helpful in terms of how we thought about the range. And then I will hit on one of your comments just again because you asked about what move-in rents were doing in January and February. I'll just reiterate that for the group. Move-in rents were down 10%, 11%. So pretty consistent with December performance, which is, what you'd anticipate, right, because we're at kind of the trough of rental rates in the winter season here, and we'll be looking to March, April and May to see some acceleration in moving rents. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Maybe just piggybacking off of part of Michael's question. I guess what is assumed within the range of when street rates break that year-over-year breakeven point? And if you have any color around changes in -- or difference in occupancy assumptions at the high or low end of the range? Tom Boyle : Sure, Juan. I'll give you some context around both the high and the low. And specifically, you're speaking to same-store revenues. So that's where I'll focus my attention. So as I noted, at the midpoint case, that assumes that we cross that zero on a year-over-year basis for moving rents at the end of the summer and occupancy being down about 80 basis points. Pretty similar to where we finished the year in '23. And I would note that, that's -- as we sit here today, year-to-date, we're down 70, 80 basis points in occupancy, so consistent with where we sit today. In terms of the high end and the low end, the low end assumes that it takes a little bit longer for operating metrics to stabilize here. And as such, the assumption on when we cross zero on year-over-year move-in rents is at the end of the year. And in that case, we're assuming, right, it takes a little longer to stabilize. The move-in environment is going to be a little bit tougher, Occupancy is down about 120 basis points year-over-year. At the high end, we're assuming a more vibrant spring leasing season, one, which we see a little bit of a rebound in the housing market, something we spent a good bit of time talking about through the fall of last year. There are some indications that we could experience that this year. The high end of the range assumes that. And as such, that zero crossing point is at the beginning of the summer in that spring leasing season and occupancy, as you'd expect, results in better performance down about 20% -- or 20 basis points -- sorry, 20 basis points throughout the year with an acceleration in the summer and a higher peak seasonally. Juan Sanabria : And then for my follow-up, you're assuming acquisitions in the guidance. So just curious, if you could speak to the investment environment, any color on where you're seeing stabilized cap rates and just the quality and the quantum of opportunities out in the marketplace? Joe Russell : Yes, sure, Juan. I'll take that. I would say, at this point, we're continuing to see the same environment that we saw through most of 2023. So a lot of owners are reluctant to put properties into the market. Knowing that they're going to potentially not achieve the cap rate or the valuation that they expected based on prior year inflated valuations, et cetera, when interest rates were at a much different price point. So the reluctance continues. The amount of activity going into the first part of this year, which is typically very light, is just that. We are getting a number of inbound discussions that are tied to properties that are quote-unquote not on the market to either test the water or judge whether or not we are ready to transact at a valuation that either meets or would be acceptable for that particular seller. We do not have anything as noted in our release, currently under contract. The team is busy. We're engaged in a number of different conversations with a variety of different size opportunities, whether single assets or larger portfolios. But as we saw in 2023, the beginning of 2024 is likely to be very similar. And we'll see going into the next few months, if there's either some pent-up demand or additional realization that cap rates have adjusted, and we'll just see if, in fact, there's going to be more trading. Clearly, one thing that could moderate that to some degree in push activity to a higher level is some activity by the Fed reducing interest rates, potentially with some impact on cap rate adjustments, et cetera. But frankly, there's just not a lot of trading going on right now to give you any really clear sense of how directly cap rates have changed at the moment. But the gap continues, meaning the level of seller expectations to what we feel are prudent ways for us to allocate capital. Many of the conversations just start with that, and we'll see how that plays out here in the near term. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Spector : Great. Just trying to think about all the comments, upper end, the lower end assumptions, skepticism, we continue to hear. Just some of the concerns, I mean, I guess to be clear, are you saying from the data you're seeing year-to-date that you finally feel there is more or greater visibility on how to forecast this year versus, let's say, last year? Tom Boyle : Yes, Jeff, I think as we sit here today, we do have more visibility, we think, heading into this year. I mean, I just spoke earlier around how we couched the ranges last year in the macroeconomic environment. Our view is the macroeconomic environment is clearer this year. We're not couching the ranges that way. And as we sit here today, right, is very different than last year. Last year, we knew that demand was weaker, and we were going to see revenue growth decelerate through the year in a pretty meaningful way. This year, that pace of deceleration has really slowed. And as I highlighted earlier, there's actually some markets in our portfolio that are reaccelerating already in the first quarter, which we view as leading as we move through the year. And so from a range of variability less than last year, that's not to diminish the fact that we're still in an uncertain environment. We're still talking about moving rents being down 10%, 11% to start the year. That's not like a typical pre-pandemic year, where we'd be debating our move-in rent is going to be up 3% or are they going to be up 5% in a very tight band. That's not the environment we've been operating through in the last several years. And as such, we think we've couched the ranges appropriately to encapsulate that variability. But we do feel more confident in the range of outcomes this year than we did last year. Joe Russell : And like many times, Jeff, it's never one single issue, but Tom just went through a number of the things that have given us more clarity and perspective going into this year that we think are, a, additive one by one. Another factor that's continuing to trend very favorably to the entire industry that we're seeing, particularly in nearly every market we operate in our reduced levels of deliveries. The development business has continued to be very, very difficult. Funding for new construction is either at a very high cost or from an availability standpoint, very limited. The time to get through entitlements even for our own processes are continuing to be very difficult. So this too creates another additive element that we have even more perspective on now that we've been through a multiyear deceleration of new development deliveries, putting us in a very different position even year-by-year that we've had more confidence to say this is a different environment, very different than where we were even a year ago. So with that, we think that we've got the right perspective, continue to read the variety of tea leaves out there, but we are very confident that we've got the right tools to guide us and put the kind of perspective that we've got into our outlook for 2024. Jeff Spector : Great. And then my follow-up is, can you discuss trends you're seeing in January and February, including move-in, move-outs, and maybe which markets are doing better or worse? Let's say, year-to-date? Tom Boyle : Sure, Jeff. I mean I think I've already covered the move-in rate component and as well as the occupancy side. So maybe I'll just focus on the market part of the question, which is not too dissimilar to fourth quarter performance. We continue to see strength in Southern California, for instance as our strongest area of growth. And as we spoke about through '23, the markets that had the highest highs in '21 and '22 are giving back some of that appropriately so. And so the weaker markets on a growth rate basis to start the year are some of those southeastern markets, Florida, Atlanta, et cetera. Operator : Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Keegan Carl : Maybe first, just where is your development line -- your development pipelines start for the year? And where are you expecting to end based on your anticipated deliveries in '24? Tom Boyle : Yes, Keegan, maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the development environment and then some of the sequencing of our deliveries. So, as we've sat here today, we've been trying to grow our development business from where we were delivering more like $100 million to $200 million in deliveries in '21 and '22. Last year, we delivered $360 million, as I noted in my remarks, we're looking to deliver $450 million in this year. So an acceleration when the industry overall is seeing delivery slowdown. So we're taking some share there in growing that business. We're doing so because we think it's the highest risk-adjusted return on capital. And you can see the returns that we've achieved on our development vintages in the sub. And we have an in-house team that's dedicated to this program, development, construction, design that are all out working on growing that pipeline. This will be a record year. The team is out of figuring out how we're going to backfill that development pipeline from here in a challenging development environment. But as we sit here today, that's a business we want to grow. And we'll be looking to backfill that pipeline and have deliveries next year, hopefully around the same levels that we have this year and go from there. Joe Russell : And yes, just from a timing standpoint, Keegan, a little lighter in Q1 but then pretty balanced deliveries in the subsequent three quarters a little bit differently than what we saw in 2023, where we had a lot of deliveries hit more towards the second half of the year. So, we've got a good combination of both ground up new development, and we're a little over-weighted on expansion and redevelopment opportunities, particularly tied to unusually large projects that we'll complete in 2024. So -- as Tom mentioned, the team is working hard not only to continue to grow the overall pipeline, but to continue to put these generation five Class A properties into a whole variety of markets. And we're continuing to see very good lease-up and again, returns tied to the development activity, both new development and redevelopment. Keegan Carl : Got it. That's really helpful. And then shifting gears here, I know Tom mentioned a little bit about demand. I'm just curious, have you seen a material change for storage demand in L.A. on the back of the flooding? And then can you just remind us of what the typical tailwind of a natural disaster is for demand in a given market? Tom Boyle : Sure. So I wouldn't call the rains that we've had in the winter here in Southern California a natural disaster. It has been raining this week, frankly. So we don't see a surge in demand. In fact, what we tend to see is Southern California residents and drivers tend to stay off the roads and you don't see as much move-in activity or move-out activity, for instance, in periods of time when it's raining here in SoCal. But overall, I'd say demand remains healthy. here. Occupancies are very healthy in L.A., San Diego, Orange County. So we feel very good about how the portfolio is set up, and we'll work through the reins here in SoCal. Operator : Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Spenser Allaway : Maybe just a more pointed question on the transaction market. And I know it's a small sample set here, but the 11 assets you closed in the fourth quarter. Can you share the going in yield and then where you expect that to stabilize? Tom Boyle : Sure. Getting into specifics, I'd say -- the -- there's a range of going in yields depending on how stabilized the assets are. So of those 11 assets, some of them were [CofO] properties where the going-in yield is zero or a little bit negative. And then you had some that were more stabilized that going in yields are probably mid 5% to 6%, and we're going to seek to improve the operations on those portfolios and get them to those assets rather, and get them to 6% plus as we think about the return profile of those assets. And that's pretty consistent with what we saw through most of 2023. As Joe mentioned, we'll see how the interest rate and capital environment plays through into '24, but that hopefully gives you a guidepost on yields. Joe Russell : And Spenser, from a strategy and appetite standpoint, we continue to look for properties that are potentially either lease-up opportunities or stabilization opportunities by putting those assets on our own platform. So not shy at all about taking on lease-up risk. In fact, many times we see an actual pretty sharp improvement once we put those assets onto our own platform. And we're confident that again, those strategies will play well even going into this year. And continue to look for a whole range of different type of assets even based on age and maturity of the tenant base, et cetera. But clearly, no differentiation relative to the strategy we've deployed over the last few years looking for opportunities when properties are far from stabilized, and again, buying the properties at the right price point, location, et cetera, continues to be very advantageous for us. Spenser Allaway : Okay. Great. And to that point, in regards to the Simply portfolio. Can you provide an update on where the rent and occupancy stands today for those properties relative to the same-store pool? Tom Boyle : Sure. So the rents of that portfolio have been improving as they've been added into our portfolio. So we've already seen some of the benefits of adding that portfolio in. The occupancy, as it sits there, I think it's in the mid-80s, today, seasonally, I think when we took it over in the peak of the summer, it was towards the upper 80s. We'll obviously look to lease that back up into the spring leasing season and take the occupancy of there, ultimately into the '90s on stabilization. So seeing good trends as we've added that portfolio and those 90,000 customers into our portfolio and on track for a good spring leasing season with that portfolio with properties orange painted and public storage signage, which the customers are reacting well to. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is A.J. on for Todd. I appreciate you guys taking the time. Just First one, as you've noted, you made good progress on narrowing the occupancy gap year-over-year over the past few quarters. I guess, why would you not expect to call back more occupancy throughout the year, given the easier comps and the broader stabilization that you're anticipating in your base case around move-in rent and demand? Tom Boyle : Yes. I think part of what you're seeing in that midpoint case is if you take a step back, right, we had really strong demands in occupancies in '21, '22. And as those tenants cycled through and we experienced weaker demand through '23, we're seeking to maximize revenue ultimately in a trade-off between rents and occupancies. And that's managed at a very granular level, at the unit level across our properties based on the demand we're seeing, the customer price sensitivity, et cetera. And so that balance is real at the granular level. And what you see at the output is it made sense to give up in effect some of that 2021 heightened level of occupancy to maximize revenues. And as we sit here today, our occupancies are down about 70, 80 basis points compared to where we started in 2023. Again, that midpoint case doesn't assume that there's a big uplift in seasonal demand. And so you're kind of -- you're not getting a big lift there similar to how we experienced last year. And so as we move through the year, you may see some closing towards the end of the year, but you're going to probably be finished on average through the year about the same as where we're sitting today. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the seasonality, you had softer seasonality last year. What's embedded in the guidance for 2024? And I guess, really looking at historical data. When do you expect to start seeing the pickup in rental demand for the peak rental season? Tom Boyle : Sure. So, I'll couch seasonality in terms of the peak-to-trough change in occupancy. So last year, we experienced -- taking a step back even further in 2015 to 2019, there was typically about a 280 basis point peak-to-trough change in occupancy, call that from June 30, December 31. In 2022, we experienced about a 240 basis points. So, it was a little bit less seasonal than a typical year. In 2023, that fell all the way down to about 160 basis points peak-to-trough. And in 2024, our midpoint case is a touch over 200. So, a little bit more seasonality, but not as much as we experienced in '22 and a far cry from what we experienced in the pre-pandemic time period. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Eric Wolfe : You talked about the moving rents crossing over into positive territory in late summer. Just curious where moving rents will be at that time. So what's the annual contract rate that you expect to see in late summer? And how much of that improvement from current levels is just driven by seasonality versus a strengthening of your business? Tom Boyle : Thanks, Eric. So, I think we'll have to dig up and we can get to you exactly. I don't have in front of me what our third quarter move-in rents were, for instance. But at end of summer, we're expecting it to cross zero. So I'd look at plus or minus our third quarter of '23 move-in rents. And I think the team is going to dig up third quarter contract rents, so you can have them. In terms of what we need to see to get there, there's seasonality every year. So as the question earlier, so even in a year last year where I'd call it an atypical year where we didn't see a lot of seasonal strength through your April, May and June. The housing market has been very well publicized as resetting lower in terms of transaction volumes as being a driver there. As we think about move-in rents they're going to rise and they rose last year, they're going to rise on an absolute basis into the summer. And then, what you're going to see is a little bit more growth in rental rates this year to close that gap over the time between now and the end of the year last year -- or the end of the summer, this upcoming year. Does that make sense? Eric Wolfe : Yes. No, that makes sense. And I guess the question then really is, just -- you talked about that extra gap that it needs to sort of close to get them above and beyond seasonality. Can you just put that in context? Like is that an extra gap that it needs to close pretty large relative to history? Is it somewhat normal relative to other recovery period? Just trying to understand sort of whether it's unusual relative to what you've seen in the past? Tom Boyle : Yes. I guess the way I'd characterize it is we saw less than what we would typically see last year in terms of a seasonal uplift in rents. And what we're saying is we're expecting stabilization in demand through this year, which means that we shouldn't continue to set new lows seasonally adjusted on moving rents in the midpoint case. And so that's going to result in closing of that gap. We're not suggesting that the environment needs to get significantly better, but rather stabilize as we move through this year and not set fresh lows. And to follow up on your question, the team dug it up. We had move-in rents on a contract basis in the third quarter about $16. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : A quick question on ECRIs. As you look ahead, are you projecting to be a bit more aggressive in terms of magnitude or frequency with your ECRI program compared to 2023? Tom Boyle : So, Ki Bin, we spoke about this a little earlier. There's a little bit of a give and take this year. We're expecting that on the one side, the consumer remains strong, as Joe highlighted in his remarks, and that we don't see a significant shift in customer price sensitivity, which we've been very encouraged in experiencing through '22 and '23. So that's one side. On the other side, on replacement costs, move-in rents are still down 10%, 11%. So replacement cost is higher at the start of this year than it was at the start of last year on average. And so that's going to have a detriment to overall contribution. But the flip side of that, that I highlighted earlier was the fact that we moved in a lot more new customers. Last year, move-in rents were strong, up about 9%, and that will have a positive impact on the -- not the magnitude, but the number of increases that we send throughout the year. And those things largely will offset such that the contribution of ECRIs as we sit here today in the midpoint case is pretty consistent year-over-year. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And I'm not sure how you internally gauged us, but can you provide any color on changes that you noticed on your customer conversion rate or your market share win of customers? Tom Boyle : Yes. So Joe spoke to a lot of the tools that we were using through last year. advertising, promotions, rental rates and the power of advertising platform online. So we saw better than industry top-of-funnel demand into our system, which ultimately led to good move-ins. But we also saw stronger conversion associated with both pricing and promotion, which are more conversion-related items such that conversion rates both through -- well, through all the channels that we operate in, both website, call center and folks walking in or higher in '23 compared to '22, and we're seeing good trends into '24 as well. Joe Russell : And on top of that, Ki Bin, as we've talked about, our digital platform continues to give customers the ability to again transact with us through not only digital platform, but now even through our care center, et cetera. So, we're making that conversion activity even that much more effective relative to -- again, consumer intent with all the tools that we have to get them to top-of-funnel activity, but then actually to the conversion itself from a speed, efficiency time of day. Frankly, many of our customers transact with us and off business hours now. So all very good tools that continue to lead to a very strong conversion that to Tom's point, we feel like we've got good industry-leading capabilities that we're going to continue to invest and optimize going forward. Operator : Next question comes from Zhan Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Hong Heng : I guess, first off, I'm glad you fare homes better and Shurgard definitely fell a little bit more of Northern California. But I guess my first question is just is it safe to think about the low end of the range, that's basically there being no return, no seasonal demand? Or are you expecting higher seasonal demand community than last year even at the low end? Tom Boyle : We're assuming less seasonal demand in the low end I agree with that. I think that's something I mentioned earlier. So I agree with that and more seasonal demand in the high end. Hong Heng : Okay. And then I guess my second question. You've grown your management platform pretty well. Have you had any success in sourcing acquisitions from there yet? And how big of a potential source of acquisitions do you think that could represent in the future? Joe Russell : Yes. That's key component of the growth of the platform itself. It's a very relationship-oriented business. Thus far, we've acquired close to 40 assets out of the program. Over the last few quarters, it's been on the light side. Again, it's, I think, indicative of the environment that we've been seeing in acquisitions in general with many owners not of a mindset that this is the right time necessarily to do a transaction or a trade. But with the growing platform itself, again, we saw very good traction in 2023. We've got good momentum going into this year as well. Those additive relationships, knowledge of the assets their comfort level with our own ability to transact very efficiently. We'll continue to be a good source of not only relationships but acquisition activity over time. So, I noted that now the programs at about 325 assets. And we still see good momentum to continue to grow to our ultimate goal and optimization of the platform. So, we'll likely see that in the next year to two and with that more acquisition opportunities. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Eric Luebchow : You could talk a little bit about the spread between move-in and move-out rents. I assume that gap should start to narrow by midyear just based on the move-in rent improvement you talked about. But should we expect any change in the average rents of customers moving out based on average length of stay or any other variables that we should consider there? Tom Boyle : Eric, it sounds like you have a pretty good handle on that. We're sitting here in the winter, Q4 and Q1 you're going to have that differential between the move-ins and move-outs to be higher. That's going to then narrow as we move into Q2 and Q3 and then rewiden again in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the comments that I made around moving rents getting to a point where they're not declining on a year-over-year basis through the fourth quarter will be helpful on that, but you're still probably going to end in a similar territory on gap there between move-in and move-outs in the midpoint case. And we're very comfortable with that. and managing to achieve those higher revenues from our in-place customers who are placing a lot of value on our space. Eric Luebchow : And just my follow-up, you touched on this several times, but the newer customers you've loaded at much lower move-in rates the past year. You talked about increasing the frequency and the magnitude of rate increases for that cohort. So have you seen those large rate increases kind of perform within expectations as you've started to push those through kind of toward the end of '23 and early 2024 in terms of either retention or customer receptivity? Tom Boyle : Yes, I'd say to reiterate something that Joe mentioned earlier, which is that the customers continue to behave as expected and with some strength, and we continue to see good momentum within that program, and that includes both newer customer as well as longer-term customers in the program. Operator : Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : The first is just on the same-store revenue guidance of flat. I guess I'm trying to tie your comments about a first half and second half dynamic where the first half maybe is a little bit slower and you have a pickup in the second half. So should we be bracing for sort of negative same-store as you start the year before you end the year somewhere sort of well above zero to get to the midpoint of the guidance. Tom Boyle : Yes. That's a good question, Ron. I hope that everyone is not embracing. But I would anticipate that we see deceleration through the first part of the year. And yes, that likely involves a negative performance on a year-over-year basis through the first half. And then yes, reacceleration as those -- the lag between operating metric improvement and financial metric performance starts to show in the second half of the year. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then, look, my second question is just, I guess, we're trying to figure out how aggressive or conservative the guidance is because on the one hand, you talked about last year, there were a lot more macro concerns. So maybe that was a reason to be a little bit more conservative versus this year. But you also sort of mentioned that the move in volumes at 9% was basically 2x what you did in sort of 2022, which should presumably set up well for pricing power. So maybe could you -- when you're putting all that together, maybe, can you talk about how much conservatism or not is built into the guidance this year and how we think about that? Tom Boyle : Sure. So I guess the way I'd couch it is we did cover a macro series of scenarios for our guidance ranges last year. The range on same-store revenue was about 250 basis points. This year, as we sit here, there's still uncertainty as I highlighted, maybe a little bit less than what we experienced last year -- what we were expecting last year. And so, the range is 200 basis points this year, so not too far different. Our core FFO range was about $0.70 last year. I think the range this year is $0.60. So, we're still talking about similar levels of range. And as a reminder, we operate a month-to-month lease business. And so there is some variability that could play out through the year. I've tried to be very transparent on what the range of potential outcomes are in a number of the key metrics, both at the high and the low end. And we'll look on to executing through our plan this year, and I'll leave judging, conservatism or aggressiveness to the investment community, but we want to try to be transparent around what our assumptions are and how we plan on navigating through the year. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Just one quick follow-up, Tom. It sounds like your contractual rent for move-ins will still be negative in the first half of the year. I think you said it was running down about 11% in the first quarter. I think you said you expect it to get to about a breakeven in the third quarter. I guess, what is the overall expectation for the year? I mean I presume fourth quarter might be up fourth quarter over fourth quarter, but that still leaves you kind of negative for the year? Is that kind of the right way to think about it? Tom Boyle : Yes. That's the right way to think about it, Steve. The midpoint case, I think move-in rents are down 3% on average through the year. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Just one quick follow-up for me. I think from our conversations with investors, I think they were expecting same-store revenue growth at kind of like the low end of your same-store revenue guidance. So -- what do you need to see or believe about the consumer or the length of stay to get ECRIs to drive kind of that same-store revenue growth at that low end of the guidance, all else being equal? And I know it's kind of like there's a lot of moving parts there. But just what would need to get the ECRI to the low end of the store revenue guidance? Joe Russell : Well, I would... Tom Boyle : Subject to ECRIs, right? I mean we gave you a lot of different metrics at the low end that gets you there. I gave you the perspective that demand -- new customer demand in that lower end case doesn't stabilize until later in the year and you don't cross year-over-year moving rents until the fourth quarter, really towards the end of the year. ECRIs, we're assuming in that case that there's a little bit more price sensitivity than what we're experiencing right now. To directly answer your question, move out churn, we're anticipating really in is centered around in the midpoint case, the same levels of churn we saw last year, which is very consistent with what we saw in 2019. Churn levels are up a little bit in that low-end case, but not materially. So that's what gets you at the low end. Joe Russell : And then again, Michael, as we've been speaking to, we're seeing, again, continued validation of, I would say, healthy economy, very consumer-oriented economy where the pressure points of a year ago or beyond relative to whether it was inflation, interest rates, employment, et cetera, are at a better place today with more clarity today than they were certainly at the beginning of 2023. That continues to play through relative to our own month-by-month operating metrics that we're seeing going even into 2024. So something would have to shift pretty materially away from that to give us a different low-end view as well. Tom Boyle : Yes. And we'll obviously update you on that as we go through the year. I'd maybe reiterate something I said in my prepared remarks that I would focus more on move-in rents. That has been the big area of variability over the last year or two on same-store revenue performance. Try to give the investment community some guideposts in terms of how we think about that going through the year. But we operate a month-to-month lease business where we're going to be adding about 6% to 8% of our tenant base every month. And the rate with which we add those customers is going to be very impactful on where we end up through this range. And we'll update you on what we're seeing on operating trends as we move through the year. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We'll talk to you soon. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Partnerships. Thank you. You may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Rob. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 1, 2024, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.  A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplemental report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to 2 questions. Of course, if you have additional questions after those 2, feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joseph Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated industry views. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. As we anticipated, the new move-in customer environment remains challenging. However, we are encouraged by positive trends across our business, which include industry-wide customer demand improved sequentially through the quarter, the ability to raise our move-in rates as we enter the peak leasing season; strong in-place customer behavior, including longer-than-normal length of stay and lower delinquency rates; moderating move-out volume; improving occupancy and waning development of new competitive supply, a trend we expect will continue.  As mentioned on last quarter's call, we were encouraged by month-over-month revenue growth reacceleration in certain markets, including Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Seattle. That momentum has continued. And additionally, we see accelerating trends in markets, including San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit and Minneapolis. We anticipate more markets will be added to this list across our portfolio over the next few quarters. These bottoming-to-improving trends are particularly important for 2 reasons : First, they are in stark contrast to 2023 when all markets were decelerating as we normalize from record performance in 2021 and 2022. And second, they put us on track for improving company-wide financial performance in the back half of this year as embedded in our guidance. Additionally, our high-growth non-same-store pool assets comprises 538 properties and 22% of our overall portfolio square footage. With NOI growth approaching nearly 50% during the first quarter, these properties remain a strong engine of growth. Overall, we are encouraged by what we are seeing on the ground. The team is very focused on capturing new customer activity as we approach the busy season, which will help drive our performance for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail. H. Boyle: Thanks, Joe. Shifting to financial performance. We reported first quarter core FFO of $4.03 representing a 1.2% decline compared to the first quarter of 2023. Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 0.1% compared to the first quarter of '23. That was driven by rent growth, offset by modest occupancy declines. Move-in rates, adjusting out our winter promotional sale activity were down 11% in the quarter.  Positive net move-in volumes led to a modest closing of the occupancy gap at quarter end to down 60 basis points. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 4.8% for the first quarter, largely driven by increases in property tax and marketing spend to drive move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 1.5% in the quarter. Our performance in the stabilized same-store pool was supplemented by very strong growth in our nonsame-store pool, as Joe highlighted. With the nonsame-store assets at 81% occupancy in the quarter, we have confidence in outsized growth from that pool to come this year and into the future, which is a segue to our outlook for '24. We reaffirmed our core FFO guidance for the year with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. The first quarter was in line with our internal expectations. And as we discussed on our last quarterly call, we anticipate deceleration of financial performance into the second quarter and with improvement in the second half. Outlook for capital allocation remains intact with $450 million of development deliveries anticipated, which will be a record year for Public Storage and $500 million of acquisitions in the second half. The transaction market for acquisitions remains subdued with limited volumes given a volatile cost of capital environment year-to-date. We're optimistic that there's a pent-up level of transaction activity likely to come, and we're eager to participate when that does occur. Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We refinanced our 2024 maturities in April with a combination of a 3-year floating rate note, a 15-year euro note and a 30-year reopening. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA puts us in a very strong position heading through the year. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for a Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Samir Khanal : I guess, Joe, you talked about 1Q being in line with expectations. Maybe talk around April, kind of what you're seeing on move-in trends sort of general trends you're seeing in April? And I guess, how has April sort of played out versus your expectations? Joseph Russell : Sure, Samir. Yes, I would put April in the same context of sequential improvement that we saw through the first quarter, where again, we've seen overall expected top-of-funnel demand, expected move-in activity. We've been pleased by that. It's matching our expectations as Tom and I have outlined, the way the year is likely to play out. So no surprises. And I would say, a validation of the reacceleration in a number of markets that I pointed to in my opening comments. H. Boyle: Yes. And Samir, maybe, it's Tom here. Maybe I'll just provide a couple of data points on April as well. Similar trends, as Joe mentioned, on move-in rents into April, we are starting to increase those rents, as Joe highlighted, as we move into May in the peak leasing season. Existing customers performing quite well, something that Joe highlighted in his remarks. Move-outs were again down year-over-year in the month of April, occupancy finished the month down 50 to 60 basis points. So a pretty consistent April. And obviously, we're eager to get into May, June and July here, the peak leasing season of the year. Samir Khanal : Got it. And I guess just shifting over to the transaction market, I know you mentioned it was subdued kind of possibly with rates spiking here in March and April. I guess what gives you the confidence that you'll start to see sort of or transaction or opportunities in the second half? Joseph Russell : Yes, Samir, there's likely to be a range of motivations that's going to bring a seller to market. The fluctuation in those motivations has been up and down, obviously, as we've seen over the last few quarters with the volatility with interest rates, et cetera. But having said that, we've been in active dialogue with a number of owners that will likely transact sometime in 2024. I think they're trying to gauge more precise timing based on what may or may not be coming through the discussion. The Fed may be indicating relative to change in interest rates between now and end of the year, et cetera. But on one end of the spectrum, there are a number of situations that will require an owner to bring an asset to market, whether individually or in some level of a portfolio. So we do still anticipate some activity beginning to percolate. As Tom mentioned, it's been a pretty quiet couple of quarters, but the conversations that we've been having with a number of owners are giving us confidence that there's likely some pending trading activity that we may be able to capture, thus not changing our outlook for 2024 relative to the amount of acquisition activity we're likely to capture. Operator : Our next question is from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Keegan Carl : Maybe first, just curious for your expectations in the housing market that you currently have embedded in your guidance, and if this has changed at all since your initial guidance commentary a few months ago. H. Boyle: Yes. Sure. Keegan, this is Tom. So I wouldn't edit any of the commentary that we had in February around any of the assumptions really heading into the peak leasing season here. We obviously just provided that outlook a little over 60 days ago. And as Joe mentioned and probably not surprisingly, providing that outlook 2/3 of the way through the first quarter. The first quarter played out very similar to our expectations. And I think that the range of outcomes very much intact there as well. And specifically to the housing market, we are not anticipating in any of the ranges a robust housing market. And based on where interest rates have moved, I think that's the right place to be as we sit here today as well. Joseph Russell : And again, just as a reminder, certainly, that demand factor is one, but it's one of a number that, particularly at this time of year can provide momentum and higher level of top-of-funnel demand, our view of a different customer cohort i.e. renters continues to be quite strong. So we're very pleased by the activity that's also coming from that type of customer. And with that, and then as your question alludes to a more subdued housing market at the moment, we still feel that we've got good demand factors that are going to drive the business going into a busy leasing season. Keegan Carl : Got it. And then shifting gears, maybe just a big picture question. I guess I'm just trying to figure out what it would take in the broader environment? If we think about our upcoming NAREIT meetings in a handful of weeks here, like what will it take for you guys to be more positive or optimistic tone. In other words, I'm trying to figure out what can go right in storage, given it feels like everyone is just focused on where weakness is going to persist? H. Boyle: Sure. Keegan, I'll preface some NAREIT meetings then. So I would highlight, maybe, 2 elements that we would be pleased to be discussing at NAREIT and I think would give us a positive tone. One of them, going back to Joe's commentary, is adding more markets to that list of markets that are reaccelerating, right? As we think about the bottoms that are occurring in many of these markets and reacceleration, we're a collection of 90 markets around the country, not a one-stop moving portfolio. And so adding more markets to that list gives us more and more confidence in terms of the outlook and the performance of the portfolio as a whole, clearly. The second thing, I'd maybe highlight, would be more dialogue, I think to the questions we were just discussing around capital allocation, more dialogue with sellers, not necessarily more transactions over the next 30 days, but more dialogue, more underwriting activity as we set up for what is traditionally a busier time period for self-storage transactions in the second half of the year, we'll start to have some of that dialogue here over the next 30 to 60 days. And Joe, I don't know if there's anything you'd add. No? Good. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citibank. Eric Wolfe : Maybe just a follow-up on your last answer. You mentioned that you're seeing a reacceleration in revenue growth in increasing number of markets you talked about those markets, but just wanted a clarification on that. I mean does that mean that your year-over-year revenue growth is accelerating in those markets? Or does that mean that your -- as your occupancy kind of goes up due to normal seasonal patterns, you're seeing sequential month-over-month growth in revenue, which I think you would probably expect just given normal seasonal patterns. H. Boyle: Yes. Very good question, Eric, to clarify what we're meaning by that. So specifically, what we're speaking to is month-over-month improvement in year-over-year revenue growth. So if you think about -- pick a market, it's growing 1% in the month of February, in the month of March, it's growing 1.5%. That would be an reaccelerating market. So not a seasonal thing or revenue on an absolute basis going higher because of higher occupancy or things like that, but actual year-over-year growth improvement. And contextually, it's part of the opportunity that continues to play through in many, many markets. We mentioned waning supply. So we're also going into an environment where the competition factor in the vast majority of our markets continues to decrease. Again, as we're starting to see this reacceleration that's also, for the most part, in many markets with very little new supply coming in. That's too an additive factor relative to the amount of demand that we continue to see an opportunity to drive more customers into the portfolio. Eric Wolfe : Got it. That's helpful. And then I just had a question on the sales activity. You talked about the impact on your move-in rents for the quarter. But was just curious what criteria you look at in order to determine why you should increase that sales activity. So if we look at last October or this March, is why did you decide to increase sales versus the other month, especially given some of the recent positive demand indicators that you're just talking about. H. Boyle: Yes. That's a good question, Eric. So we've run these sales consistently over time. And last year, we ran a number of different time periods. And in the month of -- tail end of February and beginning of March, we ran one as well. The primary reason is we had some inventory that we felt like we can move. And so the different points of the year, we'll try different promotional tactics, sales tactics to drive customer activity, pairing that with advertising and the like. We tend to see good traction there. We saw good traction during the winter season here, as we talked about, and we'll likely use -- continue to use promotional activity, sale activity and the like through the year this year, not dissimilar to what we did last year. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeffrey Spector : Great. In the markets that you talked about where you're seeing these accelerating trends, I guess, can you talk about that a little bit more, like what's driving that from your view and tie that into the comments that you did say, Joe, that the new move-ins do remain challenging. So I'm just trying to tie those 2 together? Joseph Russell : Yes, Jeff, maybe to start with the second part of the question. Yes, challenging on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we're seeing a good trend up. So we hope to continue to see that build as we go into further months into the year, and our confidence grows month-by-month even through the month of April, as we've talked about. So that's 1 powerful component. Thematically, many of the markets where we're starting to see this reacceleration on the early side, were typically markets that were not the high flyers and the peaks of the pandemic era, so they haven't had to reset relative to the more dramatic rate increases and overall demand increases that we saw through the pandemic. So on the flip side of that, you're not hearing us talk about Florida, for instance. So Florida has got a ways to go before I think we'd add them into that reaccelerating bucket. But on a more active level and more dominant level across the portfolio as we've listed out market by market, we're starting to see that improvement, particularly where we've got markets that weren't those high flyers but seeing more consistent performance, and we're seeing to see -- we're starting to see that reacceleration as we speak. So there's more to come. As we've also talked to, so we're confident as the year plays out, we're likely to add to this list of reaccelerating markets. And again, as I just mentioned, with many of these markets not dealing with an abundance of new supply as well. Jeffrey Spector : My follow-up then [Technical Difficulty] so you've revised their numbers a couple of times now. Joseph Russell : Sorry, you cut out. Can you repeat? I'm sorry, you cut out for a second. Jeffrey Spector : My follow-up, Joe, is on supply. I was saying that we subscribed to Yardi, and I think they've updated that now a couple of times where this year is higher than last year, but expecting a decrease into next year. I guess, can you provide a little bit more on your supply forecast? Like are you seeing something different or the same for this year, let's say, and then for 2025 at this point? Joseph Russell : Yes, Jeff, if you step back, I mean I appreciate the way that Yardi attempts to track nationally, both development activity. And then more precisely, what I think can be more difficult is the reality of how many of those projects, actually, get -- put into production and then are likely to complete on a year-by-year basis. So we've been very consistent now for the last 2 to 3 years where we in our own development activity have seen the competitive factor of the supply taper down. It's tapering down in 2024. So I think I would say we have a bit of a different opinion if they're pointing some type of an uptick this year. What we see and has been very commanding on a day-to-day basis. And if you're actually doing development as we're doing on a national basis, the amount of headwinds, the amount of timing delays, the amount of complication market to market has not eased at all. Again, we've been very consistent about that. And then you layer on a, the cost of capital that Tom and I've been talking to as well as the unpredictability in certain markets relative to demand, et cetera, there's more headwinds than any developer on an individual basis is facing. And by virtue of that, you're seeing a downdraft in the amount of deliveries, which we think are going to continue going into next year and the year after. We're frankly looking at development if you're starting fresh in any given market that could take anywhere from 2 to 3 years just to get through an entitlement process right now. So just think about that from a calendar standpoint, that puts you out into 2026 and 2027 and there's really not an easy way to combat that. So the risk factors tied to development continue to increase for all the factors I just mentioned. And we're pretty confident that our lens into that activity is far more accurate than others. Operator : Our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Thomas : Tom, I just wanted to go back to the guidance, which you affirmed, and it sounds like the quarter was relatively in line overall. I'm wondering, are you still anticipating move-in rents to cross the 0 threshold later in the summer and occupancy to remain down about 80 basis points in the year or has the mix shifted around a little bit following this quarter's and the April performance that you discussed? H. Boyle: Yes, Todd. No, I'd point you to all of that commentary that we had on the February call as intact as it relates to the assumptions that underlie the range there. And as you'd anticipate, the next 3 months are going to be important as to which directions we're heading on certain of those metrics. We've been encouraged by performance to date. And we'll have more to talk about ranges and things like that as we move through the year. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then following up on that, is there a scenario in which move-in rents remain a little bit weaker than you anticipated down double digits or high-single digits, but occupancy continues to improve and you end up closing that gap entirely. And if so, what would that look like? What would the sensitivity around the model look like for guidance purposes, if there was an outcome in that sort of direction? H. Boyle: Sure. There's -- I mean, there's definitely a range of outcomes and assumptions that you can make on the revenue modeling. I think what you're highlighting is, if you have better occupancy performance but worse rate performance. But if you end up in the same spot, could you end up in the same places you otherwise would have anticipated. Absolutely. Todd Thomas : Okay. And just last question then. One of your peers saw a slight uptick in vacate activity. And it sounded like that there was an expectation that there'd be some sort of continued normalization around vacates and in the length of tenant's days. Your vacate activity was lower in the quarter versus last year. And I'm just wondering, if you expect that to continue? Or do you see potential for vacate activity and the length of stay trends to normalize a bit more going forward? H. Boyle: So I think there's a couple of parts to that question, Todd. I think the first one is around length of stays and what we've seen trend-wise. And we've been really pleasantly surprised over the last several years at how sticky the length of stay has been when we were sitting here on calls in 2021, we were concerned that maybe there'd be a pretty quick return to normal or \"pre-pandemic\" length of stays, and we're now sitting here in 2024 still talking about longer length of stays compared to pre-pandemic levels. But we're certainly off of those 2021 and 2022 peaks. And so there has been a \"normalization\". But I think some of the factors that have led to longer length of stay are durable. We've talked about customers that are using storage because they ran out of space in their home, less housing turnover likely leads to longer length of stays. All these things can be a positive as it relates to length of stay. And so while we're off the piece, we still remain encouraged by customer behavior and the length of stays that we're seeing in the portfolio today. So it may be the first part. The second part is, how are we thinking about move-out activity and move-out activity, I think, in the midpoint case is for basically flat year-over-year move-out activity. So we're not anticipating a spike in that midpoint case. Joseph Russell : And then maybe just a third component from a macro health of customer standpoint with plus or minus 85% of our customers being consumers, employment trends continue to validate the economy is in very strong shape. We're not seeing any elevated level of stress play through that even takes us back to the pre-pandemic levels, i.e., they're better. Payment patterns, delinquency patterns, et cetera, are still in a very good zone. We're not seeing any new and undue stress that's coming through on the customer environment as a whole. So we continue to be very pleased and confident about our ability to see that level of stability with our existing customer base. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Appreciate the time today. Just wanted to touch on same-store expenses a little bit. I saw slightly elevated growth in property taxes. I think you had guided to that being up about 5%. So maybe kind of is there any kind of seasonality to think about throughout the year in property taxes and then also marketing expenses up significantly. How should we think about how those trend throughout the year given the unique dynamics of this year with spring leasing coming up? H. Boyle: Yes, that's a great question. So as you highlighted, operating expense for the quarter was above our full year outlook. And so we are anticipating that overall operating expense trends will improve. And so you've hit on a couple of the drivers of that, and I'll elaborate on a couple of others. The first one, property tax, we still are anticipating property tax to be plus or minus 5% year-over-year growth for the year. The first quarter did have some reassessments that were earlier in the year this year that was kind of onetime related. On the marketing topic, similarly, if you look at marketing spend in the first quarter, it was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter, which is a little bit higher seasonally, we'd anticipate marketing spend both on an absolute basis, but also on a year-over-year basis to moderate a little bit as we move through the year, obviously, depending on customer demand activity and the like, but that's another driver. But I would also add 2 others. One is our capital investments that we're making in solar power on our rooftops, which has a myriad benefits for us, obviously, the environment and our customer base. And one of the factors there will be lowering utility expense. We had that in the first quarter, but that's going to continue as we move through the next couple of quarters. And then also the technology investments that we've made around our customer interaction now over 2/3 of our customers are coming to us and renting digitally before they ever show up in a property. That number continues to grow, and we've been very clear around some of the opportunities to utilize that for specialization and centralization of roles and lower payroll expense as we move through the year, and we'll see more of that heading through 2024 as well. Eric Luebchow : Great. Appreciate it. And just on a -- for a follow-up, you mentioned some of the risks of development right now, you're seeing longer lead times for things like entitlement, higher construction costs, higher interest expense. So it seems like PSA is really leaning in now. A lot of your competitors may be pulling back. But do you have any change in your outlook to get to kind of an 8% NOI yield bogey within 3 to 4 years, which I think was your historic underwriting. Anything you can call out specific where the markets you're developing today, the supply conditions, the competitive intensity, why you're -- what gives you the confidence you can get to those type of returns? Joseph Russell : Yes. I mean we take clearly a multiyear view of that hurdle rate. It hasn't changed even out of some of the pressure points that we've spoken to. So we continue to see the opportunity to find very good land sites, assets that will, from a competitive standpoint, not be burdened relative to any undue risk. That's another thing that we factor in with the amount of data and the knowledge we have submarket to submarket that gives us the level of confidence we can get to that hurdle, if not higher. So really haven't changed any of our hurdle expectations and/or the risk that, that might convey relative to what could play out on a market-by-market basis. To your point, yes, there's definitely more things that we're evaluating relative to the cost, timing, rent level achievements, et cetera, that go into underwriting, but we're still confident that we're adding to and finding very good sites to continue to grow our scale in many, many markets nationally. So development team is working very hard to uncover those opportunities. Frankly, maybe another point to your question, we have a different and more advantageous competitive advantage. We're seeing more land sites that might be further into entitlement processes that we are interested relative to potentially accelerating some of those delivery hurdles that I talked about. So many factors in this environment actually played our platform quite well, and we continue to one by one take advantage of those. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Given what you've started to see in some of the markets turning, bouncing off the bottom and starting to reaccelerate, does that mean that ECRIs in this market could also start to pick up? H. Boyle: Yes, certainly. I mean as you see momentum in a market, we've talked consistently about how we think about existing customer rent increases. One of the factors is certainly the cost to replace a tenant and as we see moving rate and demand activity percolating in those markets that will feed into our thinking about, well, should a customer maybe receive a higher magnitude or higher frequency of increase, so. Absolutely. And I think second piece of our existing customer rate increase models around customer performance, and we've been speaking in a couple of previous questions around how we continue to be encouraged by that behavior. Michael Goldsmith : And my second question is around the type of customer that's acquired through the sale process that you did, does that generate -- does the sale generate incremental demand? Or does it help you take market share? Does that customer have a different demographic profile of length-of-stay customer? I'm guessing -- I'm trying to get at is it would seem that there should be a higher customer acquisition cost for this customer, trying to determine if there is a -- how does that customer lifetime value look for that customer. H. Boyle: Yes, Michael. I'd say across the Board, different pricing, promotion and advertising tactics will lead to drawing more, a little bit different mixes of customers and the like to our stores. And so we pull those different levers throughout the year, looking to try to maximize NOI ultimately. So revenue less the advertising expense associated with it. And so we're toggling those levers, trying to maximize that outcome. And so as you look at a sale, for instance, it will draw more customers and we'll use some different tactics around pricing and promotion and advertising to try to optimize that overall lifetime value of the customer. Operator : Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Spenser Allaway : Consumer Health continues to be topical just given the economic backdrop. But I was just wondering specifically about the commercial tenant. Can you comment on the health or appetite of the business consumer? And how has that changed, if at all, in the last year? Joseph Russell : Yes, Spenser. I would say in light fashion, no stress points or any other headwinds that we're seeing from that type of customer. There's obviously a very broad range of user types, different industries, some are product-oriented, some are service-oriented, some are very specific to certain locations. But I wouldn't, in any way, characterize we're seeing any elevated level of stress, actually, still very good, consistent use of storage, particularly, as I mentioned, there may be certain factors that pull a commercial customer configuration into one property at a higher or lower level than another. But again, nothing that we've seen that indicates there's an elevated level of stress or concern. As the economy continues to be quite good, we're seeing actually still good demand factors coming from business users overall. Spenser Allaway : Okay. And then on the marketing front, just curious if the dollars being spent on advertisement are fairly comparable across markets or other regions or particular -- sorry, other regions like a particular focus where you guys are either trying to push occupancy or where you're seeing greater top-of-the funnel demand that might entice you to spend more? H. Boyle: Yes, Spenser, it's a good question. And maybe a follow-up to Michael's question on how we're managing pricing, promotion, advertising. All 3 are being utilized really at a local level to drive a combination of either traffic in the form of advertising or conversion rates related to pricing and promotion activity. And advertising is something that we can use either nationally or what we typically do is much more locally to support top-of-funnel demand in local markets where we're getting both a combination of good return on that ad spend but also supporting properties that would benefit from incremental top-of-funnel demand. So it varies pretty widely. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Daniel Tricarico : It's Daniel Tricarico on for Nick. Following up on some of the earlier questions in your commentary, Tom, and sorry to harp on this. I know you've talked about ECRIs being a combination of price sensitivity and cost to replace, the latter now increasingly elevated today in relation to the discounted pricing strategy you're using. So my question is, how do you think about the magnitude and velocity for which move-in rate needs to improve so that the cost to replace or in theory, the roll-down effect is offset and revenue growth can reaccelerate again? Or is there another way I should be thinking about it? H. Boyle: There's a lot embedded in there. I think the first thing, I would say, is as you look at cost to replace, you all can see some of the elements that go into cost to replace pretty clearly based on our move-in and move-out rates. Some of them are different and related to how long we think a unit will be vacant, what the advertising spend may be associated with the unit, what the promotional activity may be around it and that's all managed at the individual unit level. And so big picture, one of the things we've highlighted this year is that we think overall contribution from existing customer rate increases will be pretty consistent with last year. And you said, well, how can that be if you think cost to replace maybe a little bit higher. And I'd say, well, there's another element that I add to what I just highlighted, which is the mix of the tenant base. So we had success in moving in a meaningful number of new customers last year above and beyond the prior year. Those customers tend to get a higher frequency of increase earlier on in their tenancy and that's contributing to performance this year of our ECRI program. And so I think there's a multitude of different components there. Cost to replace is certainly an important one. But as we look at the year, this year, we think overall contribution will be relatively consistent. Daniel Tricarico : Maybe a less convoluted follow-up. Could you share how you bucket the demand segments for the business, maybe to give us a better understanding of the current picture? Is the general like job and homemover 30% or 40% of demand and then the longer-term business customer 20% and then another cohort the balance? Any color you could share from any of your internal data would be great. H. Boyle: Yes, sure. So I anticipate that overall demand contribution this year is pretty similar to last year. And the way we've bucketed the contribution to move-ins last year was about 15%, 1-5 percent of customers that are coming to us because of an existing home sale related move and that was down from about 20% in a more typical year. So a relatively modest contribution. Customers that are moving and they're renters, either single-family or multifamily renters, tend to make up a larger percentage, call it, between 40%, 45% of the tenant base. And then you've got another group that we've consistently spoke of that's been elevated post-2020, and that's customers that have run out of space at home. That's been a consistently outpunching pre-pandemic levels and is likely to be more like 15%, 20%. And then as you go beyond that, I'd call it other. There's a whole host of interesting use cases as well as commercial tenants that will make up the rest. And so we continue to see good, obviously, move-in activity at our stores. And as Joe mentioned, we've been encouraged by that activity year-to-date. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just on the acquisition front, can you remind us how much is assumed or baked into guidance for presumably accretion from the acquisition volume highlighted in guidance? And then kind of as a subset of that question, how are you guys thinking about Canada? I know the family -- the Hughes family has some assets there, does that prohibit you from potentially getting involved there? Or is there any time that the family may be looking for one reason or another to monetize their stake? Joseph Russell : Sure. Yes. So to again, point to 2024 guidance on acquisitions, we've pegged $500 million. Obviously, at this point in the year, it's going to be more back ended. But some of the commentary, Juan, earlier in the call relative to what we're likely to see with a range of different motivations from sellers, we've got, I think, good perception into the ways that we can get to that kind of acquisition volume as we sit here today. The Canada question, to your point around the Hughes family and their ownership and platform in that market, it does not impede our ability to go into that market itself. So there are no conflicts on either side for either party to continue to look at a range of investments in that market. So with that, no commentary relative to what the future may play out, but there are no constraints on our part. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then just a question on labor and FTEs, you guys, in your Investor Day, which is now a couple of years back, hit your targets in cutting down, I think, workforce utilization or cost associated about a quarter from prior levels. I guess where are you in further abilities to reduce FTEs or payroll costs? And could you just give us maybe a sense of kind of how the industry has changed in terms of FTEs per store maybe 5 years ago to where you are now to where you ultimately think you can end up going? Joseph Russell : Yes, I can speak to that in certainly our own platform. So the goals that we pointed to in our Investor Day presentation or achieved plus or minus a couple of years ago, so we were very pleased with the opportunity that we saw to optimize labor hours with many of the tools that supported that, particularly tied to our digital platform. What has played out from, again, the last 2 years through today and then even going forward, there's actually more to achieve. That comes from the continued improvement in our operating model, the digital tools that we're using not only for one type of day-to-day demand that comes in and out of a property, which is tied to move-in activity, but its overall customer support. We've rolled out a PS app that now we have about 1.5 million customers tied to. So that's direct account management that takes the burden off of property labor hours, very efficient for the customer as well. So it's a win-win in terms of not only time savings on our end of the spectrum but efficiency and consistency from a customer standpoint. We continue to look at very different and robust digital tools and optimization tools that give us the amount of clarity and trajectory that we're going to likely see with continued reduction in FTA hours. I think we're doing that in a very different way than the industry has done. You can look at some metrics that you can benchmark our performance to others. So Tom already mentioned that about 2/3 of our customers now transact with us digitally. That's far and excess of not only what the industry is achieving. But what level of accelerated performance we're getting from that channel and that level of interaction with customers directly. So a lot of good things that we're continuing to tackle on that front. With the amount of data that we have, we continue to look at different ways of continuing to optimize and bolt-on more, again, opportunities to not only drive down labor hours, but as importantly, maintain or increase customer satisfaction levels. So a lot of good things that we're continuing to invest in there and very confident about the trajectory we're on. Operator : Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just 2 quick ones. One is just on Southern California. If you could just provide just updated thoughts, it's still one of your best-performing markets. What's sort of the prospect of that starting to reaccelerate as you're sort of going forward and how is fundamentals trending on the ground? H. Boyle: Yes, that's a great question. So Southern California continues to be a strong market for us, both Los Angeles as well as San Diego. During the quarter, we were impacted by some storm activity and state of emergency restrictions that impacted the quarter's financial performance for a couple of months. But those markets continue to see strong customer activity, and we have confidence in those markets heading through the rest of the year. Joseph Russell : And just again to bolt on a comment, Ron, that we made in other questions. Again, very, very little competitive new supply. It's one of the most difficult markets to either a find land sites and work through entitlement processes, et cetera. Uniquely, though, it's the market at the moment, we have the most development activity nationally in. So we uniquely are finding some interesting opportunities to expand our portfolio right here in Southern California.  And to Tom's point, we're still seeing very consistent and good levels of activity. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second one was just a follow-up on the marketing spend question. Is it fair to say it's at the highest level in 5 years as a percentage of revenue as number one. And then can you talk about the breakout of that marketing spend inflation between just cost per click going up versus just more marketing being done if that makes sense? H. Boyle: Yes. So a couple of questions, components there. So the first quarter and fourth quarter, we tend to see higher percents of revenue as we think about supporting demand in quarters where we have seasonally more inventory to rent, and we get good returns in those quarters to do that. And then we typically see the second and third quarter marketing spend come down a little bit as a percentage of revenue. As you look at the quarter, yes, it was probably pretty consistent with some quarters we had back in 2018, 2019, maybe a touch under what some of them were, but a comfortable range as we think about the level of marketing support that we're providing the stores. As I mentioned on a previous question, that's dynamically managed around local demand trends and supporting the business. But I would anticipate from an absolute percentage of revenue that's likely to decline in the next couple of quarters like it did last year before coming up again in the fourth quarter to support higher inventory levels at the lower levels of occupancy we experienced in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe just on acquisitions. It looks like subsequent to the quarter end, you had $34.6 million in acquisitions. So just wondering if you could talk about how these properties came about? Were they 4 separate deals? What type of seller? Joseph Russell : Yes. Individual sellers, Caitlin, small or deal-by-deal opportunities. As typically, we see there's a range of different seller types that were in dialogue very actively. So these were, again, individual owners. I would tell you, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to have a whole range of different conversations with different owner types, whether family owners, individual owners, institutional owners, but again, the deals that we've got either closed or under contract or just that very one-offs, smaller assets that fit well into certain markets that we're certainly interested in growing scale, et cetera. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just one on the move-in, move-out spread, it looks like it's flattened a bit. So do you have a view on whether we've hit the trough of that spread given where the move-out rates and move-in rates are at this point, and I guess, expectation going forward? H. Boyle: Yes. We would anticipate, Caitlin, that, that spread does narrow in the second and third quarters seasonally before widening out again in the fourth quarter. So not dissimilar from a seasonal trend standpoint to what I was speaking to related to advertising. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Ki Bin Kim : So I'm not sure if I missed it or not, but did you give an update on April move-in rate trends? H. Boyle: I did, Ki Bin. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. I'll just go back in the transcript. When you look at the year-to-date changes in sequential rents, how does that compare to what you would consider a normal seasonal pattern, has been better or worse? H. Boyle: I'd say on a year-over-year basis, it's been pretty consistent, touch better than last year, which is what we'd anticipate. And obviously, we're anticipating that likely to continue here through the peak leasing season. We'll update you on that as we move through the next 3 months or so. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And on your CapEx, you have $150 million for the Property of Tomorrow program that's supposed to wind down next year. But just trying to get a better sense of it. I mean does it go to 0? Or is there a certain level that you might have to keep for a longer time? H. Boyle: No, it's going to go to 0. Probably some of the cash payments on the cash flow statement will continue into the first quarter or so of next year just as we wrap up the program and make our final payments. But ultimately, that will go to 0. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Just given some of your comments around improving trends in more markets. Could you talk a little bit kind of January, February, March, specifically around street rates kind of on a year-over-year basis. How that was improving throughout the quarter. Like do we kind of sort of like we're negative 15 and now we're like a negative 10 and heading towards 0 that's kind of embedded in some of your guidance going forward? H. Boyle: Okay. So there's kind of 2 parts to that question. One is the accelerating markets, and those accelerated markets are driven by a whole host of things and not just individually moving rents, right? But as we think about that, we highlighted on the previous call 2 or 3 markets that were accelerating at the time we were sitting there in February, and we added a handful of markets to that. So we're definitely seeing improving trends across that group of markets. I think your next question was just sequentially as we think about year-over-year declines in move-in rents and on the February call, I had highlighted that January, February move-in rates were down in the 10% or 11% ZIP code. And we finished the quarter and had April right around that same sort of level. Obviously, there's periods of time where it's a little bit better than that, periods of time where we're lowering rates to drive move-in volume. So it's been relatively consistent, which is what you'd anticipate really through the first part of the year because you're at the trough point of rents. And as I noted, we're at the point of the year now where we are raising rents now. And that's when we're likely to see some changing activity as it relates to those trends, as we've discussed in our outlook. Omotayo Okusanya : That's helpful. And then for ECRI increases, are they also kind of consistent versus what we've been seeing in recent quarters? H. Boyle: Yes, pretty consistent in terms of trends. With the exception of what I highlighted earlier around more newer tenants added to the program, given that strong move-in volumes last year. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Sorry to drag out the call longer here. But what are some of the attributes of the markets where you're seeing the improvement that you flagged? Is it just less supply? Because it seems like that list that you rattled off was dominated by kind of bigger cities. And as a follow-up to that, is the momentum you're talking about? Is it better momentum in move-in rates? Or is it just more traffic-oriented? H. Boyle: Sure, Mike. I think there's a number of factors. You rattle off some of them that are contributing to it. We listed a series of markets. Each market is a little bit different. Certainly, supply plays a component in some of those markets, meaning a lack of supply, higher barriers to entry as Joe spoke to on certain of those markets. But I'd also highlight stronger demand trends, better move-in rent trends, better move-out activity. It's really a handful of different drivers that are unique to each market. But as you characterize them all, I would categorize them into markets that didn't have the same, really strong levels of growth in '21 and '22 and so don't have the same level of really difficult comps to come off of. And as Joe mentioned earlier, you can put Florida, for instance, as a big winner over the last couple of years is likely to take a little bit longer to normalize, but still has been a really strong performer over the last several years for us. Operator : Our next question is from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Brendan Lynch : Maybe I could get your thoughts on what's behind the lower delinquency rates that you highlighted in the script. Some macro data suggests that consumers are facing some incremental challenges, but that doesn't seem to be what you're seeing. Joseph Russell : Yes. I would say, Brendan, on a macro basis, we still see a very healthy consumer base. We've got plus or minus about 2 million customers. So full spectrum of the economy at large and not really seeing any undue pressure market by market or again, that would indicate that there's some elevated amount of risk that's coming from relative to stress points, et cetera. I think you're hearing a fair amount of commentary even now that we're well into 2024 around consumer balance sheets, employment levels are quite strong. I think this is part of the angst that the Fed is having relative to their timing relative to tapering, et cetera. So the employment and behavior from consumers at large continues to be quite good, and we're very pleased by that, obviously. On a day-to-day basis, we're not seeing the type of range of when you see a customer go into some level of delinquency, et cetera, the pace and the nature of that pattern isn't as elevated as it was pre-pandemic. So keeping a very close eye on, but no material shift and continues to give us an outlook that the consumer environment is going to be quite healthy. Brendan Lynch : Great. That's helpful. And maybe just 1 more. You rent some TV ads in the quarter. Can you just talk about your thought process around when and where to use TV advertisement versus other types of advertising? H. Boyle: Yes. We did use a little bit of TV advertising. It's one of the things that we can utilize pretty uniquely in the industry, given our national scale and platform. And so that's something we will use periodically. In this case, we used it to advertise some of our promotional activity, which we saw a good reaction to in the quarter. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments. Ryan Burke : Thanks, Rob, and thanks to all of you out there for your continuing interest and time, and we'll talk to you soon. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ryan Burke. Thank you. You may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Rob. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, July 31st, 2024, and we assume no obligation to update, revise, or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports, and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, after that, feel free to jump in queue with more. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated views. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. Our second quarter performance exceeded our expectations regarding existing customer behavior and occupancy levels, but fell short on rents charged to new move-in customers. Move-in rents were down 14% with competitive pricing dynamics in many markets. That compares to down 6% in our original forecast. Accordingly, we have adjusted our guidance ranges to reflect more competitive market move-in rent conditions for the remainder of the year, which Tom will cover in a moment. Overall, we are encouraged by positive momentum in our business, including new customer activity, supported by a healthy consumer with a sustained need for more space at home and the effectiveness of our broad-based customer acquisition strategies. Occupancy trends outpacing expectations with positive net move-ins year-to-date. Our in-place customers are behaving well with good payment patterns, reduced vacate activity on a year-over-year basis, and strong length of stays. Our high-growth non-same-store pool, which comprises 542 properties and 22% of total portfolio square footage is leasing up quickly with NOI growing nearly 50% during the second quarter. Several markets within our portfolio are seeing month-over-month revenue growth improvement. Waning development of new competitive supply, which will be supportive to accelerating operating fundamentals. And the acquisition market, while still quiet, is showing some signs of broader activity. Based on these favorable trends and our strong capital position, we also repurchased $200 million in Public Storage common shares during the quarter. We continue to view 2024 as a year of stabilization across our portfolio. We are excited about our trajectory over the near, medium and long term. Now, Tom will provide additional detail. Tom Boyle : Thanks Joe. We reported second quarter core FFO of $4.23 per share, representing a 1.2% decline compared to the same period in 2023, and in line with the same 1.2% experienced during the first quarter. Looking at the same-store portfolio of stabilized properties, revenues declined 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. A relatively even mix of lower occupancy and rents drove that decline. The rent decline was primarily driven by lower market move-in rents, which were partially offset by better-than-expected behavior of our in-place customers. Our occupancy gap compared to 2023 narrowed to down 30 basis points at quarter end, outperforming our expectation on positive net move-ins. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 90 basis points in the second quarter. As our operating model transformation and solar power generation strategic initiatives reduced payroll, utilities and indirect costs, helping offset other line items. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool declined 1.6% in the quarter. Our operating margin remained healthy at an industry-leading 79%. The strong performance of our non-same-store pool continues, as Joe mentioned. With this pool at 83% occupancy and comprising 22% of our total square footage, it will be an engine of growth for the remainder of this year and into the future, which is a good segue into our updated outlook for 2024. We revised our same-store revenue assumptions and core FFO per share guidance to reflect lower move-in rents during our busy season, namely in May, June, and into July. We removed the more optimistic scenarios within our revenue growth range, which reflected the possibility of move-in rents reaching parity with last year during 2024. The assumptions underpinning the negative 1% growth scenario at our new midpoint are as follows; move-in rents, on average, down 12% for the full year, finishing in December with move-in rents down mid-single-digits. Our other assumptions are unchanged. Occupancy averaging down 80 basis points for the year and a consistent contribution from existing customer rent increases compared to last year. We also adjusted our 2024 non-same-store NOI outlook by $17 million at the midpoint to reflect later timing of acquisition closings and lower move-in rents similar to the same-store pool. Our outlook for the non-same-store pool is for a strong 32% growth this year at the midpoint. That strong growth is expected to continue with an additional $110 million of incremental NOI in 2025 and beyond from this pool. Based on those assumption changes, we have revised our core FFO guidance to range of $16.50 to $16.85 per share, an approximate 1% reduction compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Our outlook for capital allocation in 2024 is unchanged. We will deliver $450 million in new development activity this year, a record year for Public Storage. We're seeing signs of activity in the acquisition transaction market, and we're both eager and well-positioned in pent-up activity services there. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We refinanced our 2024 maturities in April and leverage of 3.9 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA puts us in a very strong position. As Joe highlighted earlier, we are encouraged by positive momentum in many aspects of the business. We're confident in our trajectory as we move through this year of stabilization in 2024. So, with that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess, good morning out there. Maybe, Tom, just sort of following up on the sort of the guidance changes in the down 12% that you and Joe sort of spoke about. Maybe just talk about either the market mix or how you thought about that? And I guess under what economic conditions or housing scenarios, could that possibly get better in the back half of the year? And I guess, what are the risks that, that down 12% could maybe be worse than you're currently forecasting? Tom Boyle : Yes. Sure, Steve. So, there's a couple of components there. I'll start with the first piece that you highlighted, which is, what are we seeing in markets? And we are seeing continued positive momentum in many of the markets that we've highlighted to date, the markets like the Mid-Atlantic, Seattle, San Francisco and we can reiterate those if helpful. But we're seeing improvements in move-in rents in those markets as well. So, a market like Seattle, for instance, was nearly flat on move-in rents for the second quarter already with improving trends there. The flip side, and we've spoken about this a good bit is that markets that were maybe more high flyers during the last several years have tougher comps and continue to have move-in rent growth that is more like down in the 20%, even higher than down 20% in many instances. Those markets are still in very good shape versus pre-pandemic in terms of their demand fundamentals, population inflows and the like, but are going to take a little bit longer to stabilize. And I'd say big picture, for move-in rents. We've seen a modest improvement year-to-date, right. If you look at the first quarter, move-in rents for us were down 16%, the second quarter down 14%. As we sit here in July, they're down 12%. So, the improvement is there. It's just more modest in terms of pace than what we had originally outlined in our February call. And as we sit here today, we're still calling for modest improvements here, but we've recalibrated that pace into the second half as well. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And maybe just touching on the capital allocation. It was interesting to see that the share buybacks -- and I assume that, that's partly a function of capital activity on the acquisition side, just not really being there. I guess, what are you seeing on the acquisition front? And I think you mentioned maybe things were picking up a bit, but what are the opportunity sets and how do you sort of measure away the buybacks against either development spend and/or acquisitions? Joe Russell : Okay. Sure. I'll start, Steve. From an acquisition opportunity standpoint, for the last two or three quarters, we pointed to the fact that there was a relatively active amount of inbound calls that we were in dialogue with a whole host of different types of owners, whether individual, small and in some cases, somewhat larger portfolios. That type of activities still at hand. What typically happens on an annual basis, you'll see more activity start to percolate in the second half of the year. We think that there is likely that type of activity ahead of us. There is a number of -- or there are a number of different owners that, for a variety of reasons, are in a position to transact, whether it's capital constraint related or need for recapitalizing either existing assets or pivoting out of any asset for any particular reason. So, we have a fair amount of activity that gives us a level of confidence that we're likely to meet the number that we guided to at the beginning of the year. Clearly, we'll see how that continues to play out. But we're encouraged by the amount of activity that's playing through as we speak. Now, from an alternative standpoint, your question around how do we think about the timing, the size, and the efficacy of actually buying back our own stock, that's typically something that we look at from a capital alternative investment standpoint. We felt for a variety of reasons, we had a good opportunity in the quarter. to buy back shares. Obviously, we've got plenty of capital to deploy. We felt it was a good opportunity for us to extract the value that we see in our shares. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at that alternative as we always do. And with that, we'll see what plays through as we go forward. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. Just -- with the revised same-store revenue range, just hoping you could speak a little bit about the cadence or said differently, the exit run rate that you guys are thinking will come out of 2024 at, just to think about early days, I know, but how 2025 at least may start? Tom Boyle : Yes, sure, Juan. So, obviously, implied in the revised outlook is a number for the second half, right? And I think as you look at the first half, our same-store revenue growth was down about 50 basis points implied in the second half is down about 1.5%. So, I wouldn't get any more specific in terms of where exactly we're going to be the month of December or otherwise. And obviously, we'll give you 2025 outlook as we get into February. The one set of points that I would share is that we continue to be positive around the trajectory of both industry fundamentals as well as our own fundamentals as we sit here today. We've spoken about how this year is a year of stability and stabilization for the sector. There's reasons to be optimistic around future demand growth as we get through 2025 to 2027. And at the same time, that's going to be counterbalanced with declining deliveries of new competitive supply given the challenges in new construction today. So, we continue to be optimistic around the outlook for the business in future years without getting into any 2025 specifics. Juan Sanabria : Fair enough. And then just a follow-up to Steve's question. Hoping you could talk a little bit about cap rates, maybe where you're looking to buy assets whether stabilized or still leasing up? And kind of maybe where assets are transacting, recognizing there's not a huge amount of volume changing hands, but just commentary on asset pricing, please? Joe Russell : Yes, I think, first of all, there's no question we need more transaction activity to either stabilize or reinforce where cap rates have trended to. If you look at the progression on cap rate change over the last two years or so -- say, two-plus years ago, we were probably looking at plus or minus 4% handles and it trenched to 5%. Today, we're probably looking at 6% handles for, again, transaction activity. But to your point one, we need to see and realize a fair amount of trading volume for those to stabilize. We clearly see the value from our standpoint, based on our cost of capital to transact plus or minus in that 6% range, but we're keeping a very close eye on what's coming into the market and what value creation you can extract, whether it's a stabilized asset or something that's unstabilized that clearly is going to have some lease activity tied to it as well. But again, we're well-positioned relative to our own cost of capital, the size and the magnitude of capital that we can deploy, and we'll confidently go forward with any opportunity that we see that makes sense, again, based on the value creation that we're seeing. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nick Yulico : Thank you. Sorry if I missed this. Did you give any commentary yet, or are you able to, on the July occupancy and move-in rates? Tom Boyle : Yes. Sure, Nick. I can provide some commentary there. I did highlight that July move-in rents are down about 12% as we sit here today. So, again, sequential improvement from the first and second quarters there. On occupancy, we're closing the month down circa 40 basis points in occupancy. So, a touch below where we finished June, but in a narrower gap than where we started the year. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks for that Tom. And then in terms of a question on ECRI, what are you seeing in trends with tenants? I mean, is there any signs of fatigue or pushback that you're getting on ECRI? I just wanted to be clear as well on the same-store guidance change. Was there any assumptions that were change on ECRIs? Or is it all just moving rents? Tom Boyle : Yes. Thanks. So, we continue to be encouraged by behavior from our existing tenants. And if you think about the existing tenant base and storage, right, a lot of the existing tenants we're speaking to today were move-in customers last year and the year before. And we continue to be encouraged by the performance of those tenants as they age with us and find value in our product in their marketplaces. And what we've seen from a trend standpoint is very consistent price sensitivity from that customer base. And at the same time, we've got an environment where we moved a lot more customers in the last year than we had in the prior year. And frankly, we've largely matched that sort of volume in the first half year-to-date, such that the contribution from more recent move-ins has been quite strong. And so we've been pointing to a relatively consistent overall contribution from that program to revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023. And that, to your point, is unchanged from our original outlook we continue to be encouraged by that customer base. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks Tom. Tom Boyle : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. My first question, can you provide more color on the move-ins, given -- you've said a few times that the net move-ins has been better than expected. Can you discuss that a little bit more? I know we all focus on housing as a key driver. But just curious to see if anything has changed on why people are moving in. I don't know if you do surveys? Joe Russell : Sure, Jeff. Yes, we definitely keep a very close eye on the variety of demand factors that bring customers to us. Housing in general, obviously, is an important part of that overall acquisition opportunity. What has continue to be quite strong. I mentioned in my opening comments, the need for more space, whether you're an owner or a renter continues to be, again, a very active rationale or active reason to come to self-storage. Clearly, it was surfacing through the pandemic. We're far past that now. The different dynamic tied to needing more space needing more space at home is the affordability factor, whether you're a renter or an owner. There's clearly less activity going on in existing sale activity the counter to that and actually the driver that's 2-plus or times larger than home sale activity is renter activity. And those customer types continue to be quite good relative to length of stay, commitment to the space, affordability factors, et cetera. And we're really not seeing any erosion relative to that kind of activity, which has been quite beneficial to the acquisition opportunity that we've been able to keep moving activity quite vibrant. So, no real change there. And actually, as Tom and I have spoken to, we look at that as -- again a very key driver relative to the vibrancy of the business overall. We're just in a more competitive environment relative to what those initial move-in rates are. But the stabilization and the behavior of existing customers is quite good. Jeff Spector : And then my second question, I think you said in your opening remarks, you talked about waning development and new supply, lower supply. Can you quantify that? Or I guess, elaborate on that comment, please? Joe Russell : Yes, sure. Again, I wouldn't say there's any sea change in the consistent view that we've had on national development deliveries, meaning on an increase on an existing stock basis. We're kind of in that mid-2% range or so. So, the development activity that seeing any particular market has been quite positive, meaning, it's not the same volume that we've seen certainly in prior cycles, and we don't really see any momentum coming back to the amount of volume that's likely to happen nationally. Like always, we're keeping a close eye on a handful of markets that might be a little too active relative to development activity. One example might be, for instance, the West Coast of Florida. There's quite a bit of activity going on there. Phoenix and Las Vegas on a percentage of existing stock have a little bit more activity than we'd like to see. But frankly, beyond that, we're very happy with the lack of new development activity coming into the markets. The headwinds around development activity are very consistent to what we've spoken about over the last several quarters. Cost of capital, timing for entitlements, risk around component costs, and then, again, the amount of time and projections that are going into rent levels and stabilization need to be factored in as well. So, with all that, we basically have a backdrop of very low development activity. On the flip side, for our own development team, it's given us a good opportunity to jump into a number of markets that's fueling the amount of development activity we particularly continue to drive. As Tom mentioned, we're looking at a record level of development activity in 2024, and the team is working hard to look for additional opportunities into 2025, 2026 and 2027. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Joe Russell : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just two quick ones. One is, just starting on with the expenses. Maybe just a little bit more commentary on both the property taxes as well as sort of the payroll reductions? And how much has being able to get a lot of tenants moving in digitally sort of help with that? And how much more is there to go? Tom Boyle : Yes. So the first question around property taxes for the quarter, up 3.9% year-to-date, up 5.6%. I think our outlook is plus or minus 5% for the year in property taxes. So, right around what we're anticipating there. And really that's working through assessments that are still catching up to both NOI as well as property value increases over the last several years based on assessment cycles. What more interesting is your question around property payroll. I highlighted earlier around some of the operating model transformation that we've continued to embark upon over the last several years, and we've talked to in some more specifics around our Investor Day going back several years. Our initial expectations at that time were to utilize one of the elements that you highlighted, which is our digital leasing platform, which we call eRental, which today, about 70% of our new lease transactions are coming to us being signed digitally before a customer arrives at the property, and that's powerful. But that's allowed us to put a digital ecosystem around that. that has enabled us to think differently around both operational roles and staffing levels. And you can see that in the P&L. Initially, we had shared reducing property hours by about 25%. We achieved that at the end of last year. And so you can see here through this year, we've got continued optimization that's taking place. And we're not done talking about this. We think there's opportunity from here. So, we continue to be encouraged by that activity, providing a digital and consistent customer experience. While I've got the mic on. On expenses, I might as well highlight our solar power initiatives as well. And I highlighted in my prepared remarks, you can see utilities down 8% in the quarter also. We're on a path of putting solar on over 1,000 of our properties over the next several years. And you're starting to see that benefit in utilities as well. That obviously benefits both, our utility expenses, also our carbon footprint and the like. So, we continue to be encouraged by that initiative as well. Ronald Kamdem : Got it. Thanks for that. And then my second question was just going to be going back to sort of the guidance changes on the new tenants pricing. I think when you think about the environment, whether it's website visits or bad debt, I think the commentary has been that's actually been pretty good. So I guess what we're trying to figure out is -- but what do you think is causing more competition? Is it just a more cost-conscious consumer? Is it housing? Like what's -- if the demand sort of indicators still look pretty good, supply presumably is coming down, what's at the heart of the more competitive environment that's driving us? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Yes. That's a good question, Ron. I think there's a couple of components to talk through there. One is what Joe mentioned earlier around our own move-in traffic has been pretty consistent with last year, which was a very strong year. So, we continue to see good traffic on our side. But we're using tools in order to attract those customers, including increased advertising, et cetera. Looking at the industry overall, as we think about the impact to the competitive landscape in our local markets, demand is down year-over-year. One of the metrics that we can share with you is around Google keyword search volumes for storage-related terms. And we've highlighted that in the past as being down year-over-year. We started the year down year-over-year. We continue to be -- now the encouraging thing there is that the year-over-year decline is half today what it was at the start of the year. So, we're continuing to see signs of stabilization there, but I think that's contributed to the competitive move-in dynamic for new customers in many of our markets. Ronald Kamdem : That\u2019s it from me. Thanks so much. Joe Russell : Thanks Ron. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On the market rent growth, you said it was down 14% in the second quarter and down 12% in July. So, can you just provide context on what happened in June just to see like the most recent sequential improvement? And then, are your expectations for the improvement in the back half of the year, is it the same magnitude of improvement just like with a different starting point? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Yes. So, a couple of components there. One, June was pretty similar, down about 12%. So, we saw a pretty good improvement from April and May into June and July, but nowhere near the pace or the magnitude of improvement that we were anticipating. And as you get into June and July, you're at the peak of the rents. And so that isn't a very important guidepost as you think about the rents through the remainder of the year. And it's also why those several months are so important as it relates to setting market rents for the year. In terms of the pace of improvement, we are anticipating moderation in that decline as we move through the second half of the year, but we have recalibrated that based on the June and July performance. And so we're starting from a different place than what we had originally assumed, but for modest improvement here. Michael Goldsmith : Thanks for that. My follow-up question is just like when thing -- this may be a little bit speculative, but when things start to get better, how quickly can things unwind, right? Like it seems that a lot of the independents and the privates kind of took their time re-cutting street rate as street rates move down? Like is there an expectation that when demand starts to come back, the other players and the rest of the industry will kind of more rapidly bring rate up. So, like when does it get better? It should improve a lot quicker than maybe this kind of slow grind down that we've kind of experienced? Thanks. Tom Boyle : I think that still remains to be seen in terms of the ultimate pace, right? We've given you guidepost in terms of what our assumptions are through the remainder of the year. We've highlighted about the fact that this is a variable and competitive dynamic for new customer rates. I'm not going to speculate specifically around private operators and how they'll react. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Tom Boyle : Thanks Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Nick Joseph : Thanks. I just wanted to touch on occupancy. You mentioned July being down 40 basis points year-over-year. it seems like implied in guidance is, could that gap divided in the back half, you're at about 100 basis points. So, can you talk about kind of what's underpinning that assumption? Tom Boyle : Yes, that's a good question. So -- we did see improvements in occupancy and more of an upward slope to occupancy through the spring here. based on the move-in activity that Joe was highlighting and frankly, really strong performance from the existing tenant base through the first part of the year as well. Heading into the back half we're anticipating if we did last year from an assumption standpoint that as you go up in the spring, you're likely to come down in the fall. And so that's what's underpinning some of that activity. And recall, we're talking about seasonal moves in occupancy that are much less than what we had experienced in the pre-pandemic time period. So, while we're talking about a little bit more decline in occupancy this year versus last year because of the rise in occupancy we saw in the first half, still nowhere near the seasonal decline that we saw in a typical year. Nick Joseph : Thank you. And then just for the $110 million of incremental non-same-store NOI, is there any additional capital that needs to be spent for that? Or is that all basically just dropping to the NOI as it flows through? Tom Boyle : Yes, that's a good clarification. So, that is on the in-place assets. And so as we think about the in-place NOI for 2024, you can add that $110 million to that to get to, in effect, our expectation for stabilization of that in-place pool. No additional capital required there. As we invest capital into the second half of this year, we'll adjust that number. And frankly, that will only be incremental upside from here. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then some of that will become within the same-store pool in 2025? Tom Boyle : Well, the upside isn't likely to come into the same-store pool, right? As you think about it, we add properties into our same-store pool that are stabilized for both occupancy, rents and operating expenses. And so as we think about upside to stabilization, that will remain in our non-same-store pool but the stabilized properties over time will cycle into the same-store pool. . Nick Joseph : Perfect. Thank you very much. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Keegan Carl : Yes, thanks for the time guys. I guess just first, maybe broad commentary on what you're seeing with the consumer? And are you seeing any material softness that sort of impacted your outlook for the rest of the year? Joe Russell : Yes, Keegan, I wouldn't highlight any particular new or evolving level of stress and/or change in the pattern of both behavior from a payment standpoint, length of stay, the amount of activity that we're just seeing relative to even movement that we can assess based on any particular stress that's playing through on our own customer base. We've been pleasantly surprised that all the tools that we're using to keep, again, delinquency in good shape or continue to serve us well. And we're not seeing any new and changing risk factor tied to the consumer payment patterns that have been relatively consistent now for a number of quarters. Keegan Carl : Got it. And then just shifting gears. I'm just curious for how your third-party management platform is trending and if there are any changes in the pipeline versus last quarter? Joe Russell : Yes, sure. So frankly, we've had a pretty good run for the last few quarters with the improved size and complexion of our third-party management platform. So, today, we have approximately 375 assets in that program. 260 of them are open, and we have another 115 that are in a variety of different stages relative to development that we'll be opening over the next year or so. This quarter, we added 17. That puts us at year-to-date over 60 additional additions to the program. . So, again, seeing a good amount of activity, both small and frankly, some larger portfolios where we've got a number of existing clients that are actually expanding the number of assets they're putting into our program. So, it's continuing to serve us well relative to additional scale in many markets. Different things that can be very advantageous, not only to our clients but ourselves. So, we're continuing to see good growth in the program and putting a fair amount of resource into it as well with the public storage team that's wholly dedicated to that platform as well. So, again, good traction, and we see some good activity going into the second half of this year. Keegan Carl : Super helpful. Thanks for your time guys. Joe Russell : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Hi thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the ECRIs and pricing a bit. Tom, I understand the contribution to revenue growth has not changed with the revised guidance. But just given the softer demand environment and the lack of pricing power that you experienced during the quarter and into July versus your prior expectations. Is there an effort to preserve occupancy a little bit more ahead of and into the back half of the off-peak rental season just to provide a little bit of a better potential setup in the 2025 when demand might recover? Tom Boyle : Okay, there's a lot there, Todd. Let me take a step back and talk through how we think about the program because I think that, that will reinforce the drivers as we think about where we're going from here. So, I've consistently spoken about really two components to the existing customer rent increase side. I've already spoken on this call around the customer price sensitivity side of the equation, which has been very consistent. The other side that I think too, is around the cost to replace the tenants. And that component, right, the cost to replace tenant is influenced by the market moving rents, how long the space will remain vacant, marketing expenses, all those sorts of things play into that side. And over the last several years, that has been the component that has been more variable, both on the upside and then on the downside over the past two years. And so there isn't an over focus internally around preserving occupancy or otherwise. But as the cost to replace increases, the frequency and magnitude of increases will moderate. And then I'd add a third component because I've been speaking to it over the past year or so, I might as well add as a third component, which is the volume of tenants that are eligible for the program. And that's the piece that's been additive as we moved into 2024 around more recent tenants that have moved in that have been a positive offset. But there's no overt decisions around protecting or not protecting occupancy. It's more of an optimization around the rents that we can charge from our existing customers who are placing a lot of value on their units. Todd Thomas : Okay. Got it. So, the percent of tenants eligible for rent increases is higher today than it was last year and the prior year, it sounds. Tom Boyle : Yes. yes, and there's more near-term tenants that are in the program. Todd Thomas : Right. Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question was just around the latest Board appointment, Maria Hawthorne. I was just curious if you could speak to that announcement and the process the Board went through to make that decision, the PSP transaction closed in 2022. So, I'm just curious about the timing and the decision to expand the Board today? Joe Russell : Yes, sure. The Board itself has a very committed and vibrant process relative to board composition skill and the collective amount of knowledge and wisdom that any phase of our Board configuration continues to serve the company as a whole. So, Maria is a great addition to that in many ways, not only based on her experience as a standing CEO of another public REIT, but also her knowledge relative to real estate. She sits on two other public boards as well. She's got very strong financial acumen, coupled with very strong history of delivering great shareholder value, et cetera. So, overall, we feel she's a great addition to the Board and look forward to her contributions with the rest of the board as it stands today. Todd Thomas : Okay. all right. thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. So, when I look at your combined marketing spend and promotions as a percent of the new contract rates you brought into the company. It was a little bit more percentage-wise than last year. When you look at that, how do you digest that? Do you think maybe you could have spent more to optimize revenue? Or are you more of the mindset that -- just the lack of -- just given that maybe slightly weaker demand that wouldn't have had great efficacy to increase it? Tom Boyle : Yes, Ki Bin, you're highlighting both promotions as well as marketing spend. Let me maybe take the two independent. Those are two of the levers. In addition, obviously, the move-in rents that we are toggling back and forth in the competitive move-in environment. And we've been very active utilizing, frankly, both over the last several years. On marketing specifically, we've increased our marketing spend consistently over the last couple of years because we're seeing very good returns. And we speak regularly around the advantages of our scale and marketplace, providing customers a rich inventory set, the power of our brand, the customers are increasingly aware of in our markets and that efficacy continues today. And so as you look at the spend increase in the second quarter, and year-to-date, those have been very good returns associated with those investments and new customer acquisition, and we'll continue to use that lever as we move forward. given the good returns associated with it, and we anticipate that to continue into the second half. On promotional activity, there's a couple of things going on with that particular metric that you're looking at. One is, I'd highlight that about the same number of customers year-over-year have received promotions, maybe a touch more. But the reason you're seeing a decline in that metric is, it's a promotional activity versus our move-in rents. And as we've discussed, our move-in rents themselves were down 14%. And so just nominally the discount dollars and promotional dollars associated with giving, for instance, the first month for $1 is less on a nominal basis year-over-year, but that continues to be a vibrant tool we're using. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And second question, where do you think your rents are today versus, let's say, 2019. Move-in rents? Tom Boyle : Yes. Our rents today are in a similar territory to where they are, we're in 2019, depending on the market, right? We've got some markets that are a good bit above 2019. And we have some markets that are below 2019 as well. We've highlighted in the past around some markets that we feel like have overcorrected in terms of move-in rents and I'd reiterate that as it relates to 2019. Ki Bin Kim : Yes. So, that's the part I'm trying to understand better, right? Since 2019, we've probably had about 20% cumulative inflation, but rental are relatively flat versus that time period. So we've definitely given back more than just the COVID surge in rents. So, I was just curious on your take, I guess, what accounts for the additional weakness? Is it absorbed through additional supply? Or, is there something else by the consumer that's changed over that timeframe? Just trying to understand where that demand has abated? Tom Boyle : Yes, I would characterize it, and Joe, you can chime in here, too. I would characterize it as we've had a sharp number of years in movement in demand, right? We had a sharp move higher and sharp move lower. And as I said, that metric is pretty variable depending on the marketplace that you're looking at. Some of the markets that Joe highlighted are impacted by new supply and so you have some of that competitive dynamic. But overall, I'd say the shift in demand lower and the tough comps of 2021 and 2022 have led to pretty competitive pricing activity amongst operators in the sector. And in many cases, that may have led to an overcorrection in marketplaces. But I think the positive component that you're highlighting is, if you think about the move-in rents today that we're charging versus discretionary income or consumers' monthly budget, it's frankly even more attractive today than what it was in the past. And so as you think about potential opportunity for that number through a cycle to move higher. I think it's more encouraging, frankly, given its more affordable today than it was in the past. And we're working through that stabilization of demand. And as an industry, we will get to the other side. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Eric Luebchow : Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about any changes you've seen year-to-date and more recently on length of stay of the in-place space in terms of the type of customers that are moving out? Are they coming from more of the lower replacement cost customers that are at lower rates versus the longer tenured customers that are materially above current movement rates? Tom Boyle : Yes, sure, Eric. Stepping back and looking at the last several years, we've spoken a lot around how length of stay really extended from 2020 to 2022. And that was a combination of longer length of stay tenants staying for longer as well as the need to replace those tenants with fewer new customers. So, from a mix standpoint, length of stay grew pretty sharply over that time period and was a big contributor to some of the pricing power and financial performance we had over that time period. Really, since then, we've been seeing moderation. And we've been really encouraged at the pace of that moderation, right? I think if I were to go back and listen to myself on these calls probably a couple of years ago, I maybe was anticipating a more rapid return to \"pre-pandemic sort of length of stays.\" And we've been encouraged by the fact that it has been several years of moderation in those numbers. And as we sit here today, length of stays on average continue to be longer than what they were in 2019. So some encouraging trends there. The second component of your question was just around vacate levels. And I'd highlight that our longer-term tenants tend to be stickier. They've gotten comfortable using their space. They have goods in there that have a use case of sitting in the unit for a long time versus maybe an apartment renter that's moving between one apartment and another and is using the space period of time, for instance, as an example, use case. And so the vacate frequency from those tenants is less. And so as you look at our vacate activity, really, in any given quarter, it's more concentrated within those customers that have been more recently joined the public storage customer base. Eric Luebchow : Great. Appreciate that commentary. And just a follow-up, sorry to harp about moving rents. But as we think about what you've assumed in second half of this year, you said the guide assumes we exit the year down about mid-single digits. Does that assume a relatively normal amount of seasonality from kind of the peak summer months into the fall and winter because I know that from a comp perspective, things do get a lot easier in September and October, given there were some more aggressive pricing actions made last year. So just thinking about how seasonality compares to what would be a normal year, and I realize we haven't had a normal year in quite some time. Tom Boyle : Yes, I think that last point is probably the operable one, which is we haven't had a \"normal year\" for a number of years. But clearly, we recognize and have taken into consideration what you highlighted around last year being a very competitive move-in environment where moving rents for the industry did decline on a more accelerated path last fall. And our assumptions, clearly, based on a narrowing in the year-over-year gap is that we don't face that same sort of decline. But we're continuing to expect that it's a competitive moving environment in the second half and that move-in rents are below where they were last year. Eric Luebchow : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Tom Boyle : Thanks Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Hughes : Hi, good morning out there. The predictive revenue growth metric when I combined contract rent and occupancy for the next quarter has been pretty accurate lately. And when I do that for a third quarter and combine it with a full year guide, it implies revenue growth actually accelerates or gets less negative in the fourth quarter. And the only time in the last decade that revenue growth improved from 3Q to 4Q was 4Q 2020 when we were coming out of COVID lockdowns. So, does that sequential improvement in the fourth quarter sounds like what's embedded in guidance? And if so, what gives you the confidence we'll see that improvement since it is so unique? Tom Boyle : Well, one of the things that I've highlighted over the last couple of years around that forward metric based on period-end numbers, is that when things are moving around quite a bit, it loses some of its efficacy. And there's certainly we've started to provide a more robust transparency related to our outlook for the year on a financial terms with our guidance. And so I'd point you more towards the implied outlook from guidance than using any particular period end metrics 1 quarter versus the other, given how things have been moving around. But specifically, I'm not going to comment quarter-by-quarter guidance, right? We're giving you annual outlook. And as I noted earlier, the second half is implied to be down 1.5% on same-store revenue specifically. And we do have confidence in improving trends in many of our markets that it's going to lead to stabilization and then ultimately reacceleration across those markets over time. Jonathan Hughes : Okay. My second question. Just looking at L.A., I noticed that the revenue growth premium there, it did slow to, call it, 60 basis points from an average of 500 basis points the prior five quarters. I know comps are tough, but yesterday, Equity Residential kind of talked about some affordability and supply headwinds in L.A. So, maybe there's a broader economic slowdown in that specific market but can expect a more modest revenue growth premium in L.A. going forward? Could that even turn negative as rents and occupancy there are the highest in the portfolio? Thanks. Joe Russell : Yes. First of all, just the overall health of that market continues to be very good, Jonathan. It's a market that we're not going to see any meaningful addition to supply just the trend that you're pointing to relative to the outstripped revenue growth that we saw in that market for a sustained period of time, and it's leveling off. We hope that we'll continue to see very good trajectory going into future periods. But we don't see some of the issues, certainly in Los Angeles that you might in other markets that have been more impacted value either supply or a material shift in overall demand, I would just say it's relatively stable at this point, and we'll continue to see how it performs. We're in very good shape relative to the quality of those assets. We see very strong occupancies. As I mentioned, no new and concerning dynamics from new supply. So, -- the other thing that supports L.A. over time is it is a high cost of living market, which again supports the inherent demand for public -- for storage relative to our particular portfolio there because, again, with great locations, great scale overall in the market, and we see good in-customer demand playing through. Jonathan Hughes : Okay. Thanks for the time. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yes, hi. Just a quick follow-up on move-in rates. Is the guidance an assumption of move-in rates improving to down mid-single digits by year-end. Is that being driven, I guess, by improvement in spot rates or just the comp issue or some sort of combination of both? Tom Boyle : Well, I guess -- In -- I'm trying to think about the right way to think about this. There's no question that seasonally, we're at the peaks of rental rates. So, as we talk about what's going to play out through the second half and what's assumed in the outlook. The level of rents in the fourth quarter are going to be lower than where they are now, right. But as you think about the year-over-year differential, we did have a pretty significant move-in rent decline as we moved through last year. And just a reminder, last year's fourth quarter move-ins for us were down about 18% year-over-year. And so the comps do ease on a year-over-year basis. And so while we're expecting, as we do every year, that rents decline between here and where they are in December, the level of decline between now and December, we're anticipating to be more modest than what we experienced last year, which was really, frankly, a sharp decline. Mike Mueller : Got it. So, it seems like you're making some improvement in there. just ignoring the comp dynamic? Tom Boyle : I would say it's primarily the comp dynamic, and we're expecting -- to decline as we typically would between a summer and winter [indiscernible]. Mike Mueller : Okay. Yes, I was thinking a little bit more outside of seasonality as the overall environment getting better from that front, but, Okay. that's it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Maybe just one more on the non-same-store pool. You guys have had great success on the lease-up front, but -- are you able to provide additional color on markets where you're seeing either above average lease-up trends? Or maybe conversely, where you're seeing some slower activity here on the leasing front? Tom Boyle : I'd say overall, leasing activity has been very strong, really, across the board within the non-same-store pool. One of the things I highlighted right, obviously, the lower move-in rents impacts the whole portfolio, not just the same store. But as we think about actual lease-up pace, you can see a strong lease-up pace in our development, redevelopment vintages, which are probably the easiest place to see that lease-up pace. We continue to be encouraged by that. And as Joe mentioned, I think that's being supplemented by the fact that there isn't an overwhelming amount of new supply in these markets that we're delivering into. And because of that, the new activity that we are delivering is being well received in the marketplace, absorbed efficiently. And we think that, that helps both our non-same-store pool, but also the dynamics for the industry and the local marketplace of our same-store assets in those marketplaces as well. Joe Russell : Maybe Spenser, just on a headline portfolio standpoint, if you look at the larger portfolios that we've taken down over the last couple of years. I'd say they are all kind of in a similar range relative to either meeting or exceeding not only our underwriting, but we've seen good traction particularly in markets where we've been able to increase scale. And then most recently, the Simply portfolio, which touched 18 different states. Again, I wouldn't point out or call out any unusual negative trends. In fact, we're seeing continued outperformance relative to our own underwriting even in that portfolio that was multi-market based. So, just to reinforce what Tom was speaking to, we're continuing to see good traction and stabilization throughout that entire portfolio and definitely look at it as being a continued driver of growth going into future periods. Spenser Allaway : Okay, great. Thank you both for the color. And Tom, you kind of alluded to this, but how does this time the stabilization for readouts and new developments today compared to historic averages in your portfolio? Tom Boyle : Yes, we typically underwrite three to four years to get to a level of stabilization of the earnings profile of the asset. And then frankly, there's another couple of years of continued strong growth from there depending on the size of the asset, et cetera. There are certainly been time periods where we've seen much faster than that over the last several years, in particular. But kind of year in and year out that we're looking for. And obviously, three or four years is a long period of time, you're going to have demand and supply drivers within individual markets that a shift that for one in particular asset or otherwise, but I'd still point you to that kind of three or four-year time period. Spenser Allaway : Okay, great. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments. Ryan Burke : Thanks Rob and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a great day.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ryan Burke. Thank you. You may begin. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Rob. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today October 31, 2024 and we assume no obligation to update, revise, or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our earnings release, supplement report, SEC reports, and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourselves to two questions. Of course after that if you have more feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe Russell : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated views. Then we'll open the call up for Q&A. As we anticipated, operating fundamentals are stabilizing across our portfolio in the broader industry. We started the year with sequential revenue growth acceleration in a handful of markets. We are now achieving acceleration across most markets and expect the trend to continue. The improvement will be gradual and take some time to be fully reflected in our reported financial results. But as we'll discuss today many things are moving in the right direction for Public Storage. In particular pricing for new customers is stabilizing with move-in rents down 9% year-over-year in the third quarter and down 5% in October. This is a meaningful improvement from the first quarter of this year when move-in rents were down 16%. Our in-place customers are also behaving very well. Payment patterns are strong, average length of stay is long and move-outs are down year-to-date. All of this speaks to the convenience and affordability we provide to our customers. With move-in rents down nearly 30% since 2022, we have become even more affordable relative to other space alternatives. including moving into a larger home or apartment just to get the incremental space. Self-storage is the affordable and convenient choice. The supply environment is also on a favorable path with deliveries of new competitive properties slowing further over the next couple of years. Less new competition will support operating fundamentals on top of the improving demand trends. We continue to focus on growth enhancing initiatives that are unique to us as well. Public Storage customers are fully embracing the new and modern experience we've created by putting a full slate of digital engagement options in their hands. These options complement the service provided by our fantastic property managers, local teams and customer care center representatives. The ability to choose between interacting digitally and in-person is a major draw to customer seeking self-storage today. I am proud of the entire team's efforts in creating the industry's most comprehensive, hybrid, digital operating model that cohesively connects our customers, team and systems across field and corporate operations. And we're tracking ahead of schedule on our transformation with now 75% move-ins using eRental, our digital online lease. We have nearly two million PS app users and on a daily basis, tenants across our entire portfolio using our digital property access and remote customer service. The transformation is amounting to a win-win-win across our customers, team members and financial performance. Through it, we have created more specialized and career-advancing roles across the company. New opportunities for our property managers have been particularly well received, as they now have career paths that aren't available elsewhere in the industry. Due in part to these efforts, we are proud to have received the Great place to Work designation, for a third year in a row. Another area of focus is utilities. We have reduced usage by 30% through conversion to LED lighting across the portfolio, and installing solar power at more than 800 properties so far. We recently increased our solar goal to 1,300 properties by the end of 2025. The team has innovated and implemented at a rapid pace over the past few years. We are fully in gear and are excited about more to come. Now, Tom will provide additional detail. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. With fundamentals improving and the team keenly focused on transformation and optimization initiatives, we are very well positioned with signs that the acquisition market is picking up. We see more one-off deals, more portfolios and evidence of convergence around buyer and seller expectations, following a quiet couple of years. Our growth-oriented capital and liquidity profile, is strong. Industry-leading leverage, balance sheet capacity and cost of capital have us poised to execute on pent-up seller dialogue in combination with our operational and acquisition integration advantages. Shifting to our third quarter financial performance. We achieved core FFO of $4.20 per share representing a 3% decline compared to last year. Revenues in our same-store portfolio of stabilized properties declined 1.3% compared to last year, with a relatively even balance between rent and occupancy. A couple of important things to note, regarding the stabilization that Joe spoke to. First, the second derivative of growth continues to improve. Revenue growth in the quarter, decelerated 30 basis points sequentially relative to the growth in the second quarter of this year. This is significant improvement from the 380 basis points of deceleration reported from the second to third quarter of last year. Secondly, as implied by our guidance midpoint, we expect our nominal same-store revenue growth to begin improving due to the positive trends that Joe described. At the midpoint, the fourth quarter would be the first sequential growth improvement in more than two years. Moving now to the outlook. We reiterated our core FFO guidance of $16.50 to $16.85 per share, rolling through higher third quarter G&A and lower third quarter ancillary income while lifting our same-store revenue outlook for the year. The strong performance of our non-same-store pool continues. We increased the outlook for our incremental NOI from this pool of assets in 2025 and beyond through stabilization to $120 million in total to come from this pool. Currently at 23% of our total square footage, the pool will be an engine of growth for the remainder of this year and into the future. With that, I'll turn it back to you Joe. Joe Russell : Thanks, Tom. At Public Storage, our team continues to enhance the industry's strongest brand, highest quality portfolio, best revenue NOI and NOI margin, leading acquisition development and integration platforms, the lowest leverage and best cost of capital, the highest free cash flow conversion and strongest FFO and dividend growth over the past few years. With many things moving in the right direction, including improving operating fundamentals, transformation efforts that are further enhancing our advantages and a reinvigorated transaction market, we are excited about Public Storage's trajectory over the near, medium and long term. And finally, I'd like to make a call out to the full operations and asset management teams at Public Storage, during the two significant hurricanes. Fortunately, our employees and properties were well prepared, with safety as the top priority and we are grateful to have had relatively minor impact. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. Maybe I'll start just big picture. I consider you guys to be conservative, especially with your outlook. So just given the time of the year, November, you've made a few comments here, not just about stabilization but actually improvement, which means it seems like you're saying you're going to end the year strong and again, it bodes well for 2025. I guess, can you talk about that a little bit more, the decision not just to talk about, okay, as you said, it's clear you see signs of stabilization. But it does seem like you're messaging pretty strongly here that you expect improvement into '25. And I guess, is that regardless of improving housing, et cetera? Joe Russell : So yeah, Jeff, there's a few things, obviously, that give us confidence that 2024 has become a year as we predicted of stabilization, where we've seen, as Tom and I noted in our opening comments, the progression of better and higher degrees of market improvement that we're seeing across more of the portfolio than we've certainly seen at the beginning of the year. That continues to trend. Now we're into the fourth quarter of 2024. Stabilization should fundamentally lead to improvement. So we're pleased by the continued trajectory we're seeing as we've spoken to stabilization. And with that, we're going to be in a better position going into 2025 than we were going into 2024. Many things are trending well. Additively, and then we'll see what impacts other effects could have too, whether it's an improved housing market, change in interest rates, continued growth in the economy, et cetera. But again, we're very pleased by what we continue to see through 2024. Jeff Spector : Thanks. And just to clarify, I mean, again, improvement, you don't really need to -- if demand just continues as is, where you talked about improving demand for that demand has improved, if it stays as is versus the backdrop you described, including lower supply pressure in '25. That ties into your thoughts on improvement? Tom Boyle : Yeah. I mean, I think there's a couple of things there, Jeff. I mean, we've been talking about stabilization of demand throughout this year. And in Joe's prepared remarks, he commented on that, including industry-wide demand. But we've been speaking all year to the fact that we've actually seen some improvement in a number of different markets. So some of the early markets we called out like Seattle, for instance, is still actually negative on revenue growth for the third quarter, but it's consistently improved quarter-by-quarter throughout this year. And so that's been a leading market that we've been observing and there are other markets like that and frankly, more. That doesn't mean that overall, we're seeing significant growth. Obviously, our outlook is still calling for same-store revenue growth to be down for the year, just a touch better than 1%. So as Joe spoke to in his remarks, the stabilization will take a little bit of time to roll through our financial metrics, but stabilization is the first step, and we've seen that across a number of markets, and we'll obviously update you on a path to recover as we move from here. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Seems like there's been an improvement in the move-in rents down 9% in the third quarter, down 5% in October. Is there any -- what do you think is driving that? And then also, can you provide the October occupancy update just to provide a little bit more context around the influence on street rates? Tom Boyle : Yeah, sure. Happy to. So the -- as you noted we've continued to see improvements on move-in rents through the year. The October number is encouraging. And I would call out that it's driven by improving demand trends, right? When we started this year industry-wide demand was down still 20%. And we're in a point now in September October where it's roughly flat year-over-year. And so some may call that comps. But again, you need to lap those comps without setting fresh new lows to stabilize and that's what we're starting to see here. We've got some markets as I highlighted earlier that have move-in rent growth, as we sit here today, but some are certainly still setting fresh lows. So the dynamic there is a stabilization trend, as we've been anticipating heading in through the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of further October updates, occupancy is down about 90% -- or 90% down -- 90 basis points. As we sit here today, the move-in rents again down 5% for the month. Existing customers are performing well. Move-outs are again down year-over-year in the month. So continued encouraging trajectory from the existing customer base and really strengthened the consumer overall. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. And you talked a little bit about demand improving and recognize -- and I think you kind of recognize that some of it is comparisons. But is there any other factors that are just driving demand in particular whether it's -- are you seeing a better housing turnover? Are you seeing a better demand from apartment renters? Just trying to get a sense of who is using the facilities more? Thanks. Tom Boyle : Yeah. That's a great question, Michael. I think the demand picture has shifted over the last several years, right? We've talked about how the existing home sales driven demand has softened. The apartment renter activity has continued to be strong. And at the same time, we've seen more customers that are using storage that have ran out of space at home frankly record usage of that through this year. And overall, levels of demand pretty consistent year-over-year as we sit here entering into the fourth quarter. Speaking to housing specifically there is some encouraging pending home sales numbers that came out, yesterday we watch that all closely. But at this point what we're looking for again is stabilization and we're looking for not setting fresh lows i.e. not demand going lower from here and that's what we're starting to see across the portfolio. Joe Russell : And maybe Michael to add on one other thing. Again, no different, but consistent and very encouraging trend. Length of stays are still longer than pre-pandemic levels. We've seen with many of the things that Tom just spoke to customers continuing to retain space on average higher than what we saw certainly pre-pandemic. And again, with the stabilized set of metrics around delinquency and payment patterns, et cetera, no different view relative to the stable customer base that we are very pleased to have here at Public Storage. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Joe Russell : Great. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Samir Khanal : Hi, Tom. As it relates to the move-in rates, you mentioned down 5% in October. I mean is there a way to kind of think about the trajectory of that move-in rates over the next, I don't know let's call it the next several quarters. I mean do we need the housing market to pick up to see that trend turn positive? Or help us think through that a little bit more please. Tom Boyle : Sure. So as we've noted a number of times on the call already really what we're looking for is a stabilization and level of demand. As that stabilization occurs, you should see a stabilization in things like move-in rents and customer activity. And so in our outlook for the year, we've expected that move-in rents are down mid-single digits at the end of the year. So it feels like we're heading in that direction based on October performance. But then we're likely to hit the trough of the year just seasonally. And so without getting into specifics around assumptions for 2025, I would expect that we probably would start the year clearly at that sort of ZIP code and would take the lift of demand seasonally in the spring to meaningfully improve that number from that point. Samir Khanal : Okay. And then just on the \u2013 just shifting gears a little bit on the expense side. Payroll has been down this year in the quarter and even for the nine months ended September. Is that just a function of sort of higher e-rentals you're doing that dynamic? Trying to see how much further in terms of savings there is kind of into next year. Thanks. Joe Russell : Yes, Samir, I talked about the many advantages that we continue to lead in the industry relative to our digital platform. One key being the one you noted our e-rental, our digital leasing platform. So now with 70% to 75% of our customers using that channel, we continue to use that as one way of optimizing the way in which we're using employees and properties relative to their optimization and skill sets and the things that they can do even on a more focused basis. So it's worked well not only for a customer interaction but employee engagement and employee opportunities relative to as I mentioned, different specializations that we're putting through in different career paths, et cetera property management levels as well. So the great news that that leads to our levels of optimization that continues to work well not only for customers but for our employees as well. Samir Khanal : Okay. Thank you. Joe Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Eric Wolfe : Hey, thanks. I was just curious in the markets where you've seen the biggest occupancy uplift. Are you seeing any greater signs of improved move-in pricing there? Or is the customer still just very elastic to that move-in price. I'm effectively just wondering if improving occupancy should be viewed as a leading indicator of pricing or if there are other dynamics that's preventing that from happening? Tom Boyle : Sure. I would say it's improving demand trends overall, right? We're trying to balance both occupancy as well as rental rate to maximize revenue. So occupancy is certainly one thing you can look at. But just using Seattle as an example, as a market I highlighted earlier, occupancy there was up 35 basis points year-over-year and has positive move-in rent growth. So there's some \u2013 there's certainly some momentum in that market but it's not purely occupancy based. Eric Wolfe : And I guess based on the test that you're doing, I'm assuming that you're adjusting your algorithms to test various price points and seeing how the customer is responding. Like are you seeing any decrease in that sort of elasticity of demand? Or when you adjust pricing like you see a big shift in revenue potential from potential changes in occupancy. Tom Boyle : Yes. So I guess taking a step back, we're looking to try to optimize the revenue associated with customers that come in the door. And that \u2013 based on our understanding of what our inventory is likely to be and so we understand what likely rental units we have to offer our customers. And so we offer those online and in the store. At the same time we have an understanding about what demand is for that sort of unit at the local trade area level. And to your point around price sensitivity, we're consistently testing and augmenting our understanding of what that customer price elasticity is. But if you have an understanding of what your inventory is to sell and what the demand is for the unit and the price sensitivity, we're trying to optimize that equation to lead to the maximum revenue opportunity for Public Storage, given the amount of inventory we have there to rent. And what we continue to see is customers are competitive and price-sensitive to new customers but place a lot of value on those units once they move in. And that's been pretty consistent over time. Eric Wolfe : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Eric Luebchow : Hi. Great. Appreciate you taking the question. You touched on this a little bit about how you were encouraged by the transaction market picking up. It sounds like that's more likely into 2025. So maybe you could give us some color on where kind of bid-ask spreads are and what kind of stabilized yields you're seeing on transaction activity you're underwriting today? Joe Russell : Yes. Sure, Eric. We've spoken to this for the last few quarters which, there's been a lot of interest on sellers' behalf to potentially trade but factually very few have indeed done so. And we've got almost now a two-year track record where again industry transaction volumes have been quite low even on a historic level. So now, rounding out 2024 differently even than we've seen in prior quarters, the volume of not only those inquiries but again, even some additional assets coming through traditional brokerage channels and otherwise, there's momentum building. Again, it's tough to say yet what the bid/ask spread is going to be, because a lot of those transactions haven't been completed yet. We've had a lot of inbound calls both, again, from owners that are looking to us even on a private basis to potentially transact. So we're encouraged by the fact that again after two years, there's I think a landscape of different opportunities rounding out this year and going into 2025. We'll see how that plays out. But would say it'd be unusual for us to go into a third year of the low volumes that we've seen. And with that we're encouraged by the type of assets that are coming to market, both small and large. And the receptivity in a different way that owners have, I think settled out relative to their price expectations et cetera. Eric Luebchow : Got you. That's helpful. And then I guess, secondly, I think you touched on kind of existing customer activity being a little bit better in terms of ECRIs than you previously expected. So maybe you can provide a little more color on that. Is that your ability to push rents to the newer customers coming in at lower rates or your longer duration customers that are more receptive to that? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Tom Boyle : Sure. Yes, I think it's a number of those factors you highlighted. The existing tenant pool continues to be strong, as Joe mentioned, really across the metrics that we monitor, be it payment patterns and delinquency, length of stays, vacate activity, customer price sensitivity to rental rate increase, all pointing to a very stable and strong existing customer base, which is encouraging and we've been pleasantly surprised as we move through this year. And really that was the primary driver of the lift in revenue outlook for the remainder of the year is just continued strong trends there. In terms of the rental rate program, in particular. it's a combination of the price sensitivity being very strong and frankly a touch better than we expected as well as the continued follow through, as you mentioned, of those newer customers that we've moved in over the past year and a half given our strong move-in volumes over that time period that give us more contribution really to the existing customer rent increase program. Eric Luebchow : Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Turning back to the move-in pricing. If you look at the promotional discount, they were up in the third quarter year-over-year. They also look like as a percentage of revenue one of the highest or percentage of move-in rents one of the higher numbers in the last year or so. So can you just talk a little bit about like what's driving that higher promotional discounts in the third quarter? And how we should think about that impact going forward maybe in the fourth quarter, because I know you talked about move-in rents that delta improving but I'm not sure how we should think about the promotional discounts in the fourth quarter. Tom Boyle : Sure. Yes, promotional discounts, obviously, ebb and flow throughout the year based on really the -- at the unit level analysis and pricing strategies. We did use promotions a little bit more into the third quarter, but again, pretty modest still relative to historical trends. And so throughout the year, between 40% and 60% of our customers have received some sort of first month promotion. In the third quarter, it was closer to that 60% number. The comparison period in say 2019, for instance, would have been closer to 85% or 90%. So the -- there's no question that there continues to be an ability for us to utilize promotions as well as advertising as move-in rents to optimize that customer acquisition plan. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. That's helpful, Tom. I guess just following up on that. Can you just remind us how that works for the promotional dollars like the timing and just the accounting treatment? Is that just all the money literally being spent as -- and it's a contra revenue account in the quarter? Or is there some sort of like amortization of the promotion? Tom Boyle : Sure. Yeah. Our most popular promotion is the dollar special for the first month rent. And as you just highlighted that's a contra revenue discount that will be applied in that first month. And so if we move a customer in on September 1st, we're going to recognize $1 of revenue from that customer in rent. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Appreciate it. Tom Boyle : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Spenser Allaway : Yeah. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the transaction landscape. In terms of what you're seeing marketed today, is it predominantly still the single asset deals? Or are there any portfolios being marketed today? Joe Russell : Yeah, Spenser it's a combination. The traditional smaller deal activities been with us. And again that's been still muted as I mentioned overall, but there's still a fair amount of individual or small asset activity in the market. But there are larger portfolios that are starting to surface. Again that's no different than what we've spoken to though over the last couple of years where we had a lot of private inquiries, particularly on some larger portfolios but there are now a few that are starting to come into the market through I would say both traditional processes and then still some of the again off-market conversations we're continuing to have as well. Spenser Allaway : Okay. Thanks. And then just on the ECRI front, if we do a rough back-of-the-envelope math like just given where move-in rents were for the quarter, it does appear that rent bumps were maybe a little bit higher in the quarter. Is that fair to say? And are you able to just give us an idea of where you see ECRIs ending the year on an annual basis? Tom Boyle : Yeah. Just given what I had spoken to in terms of their performing better in the third quarter I would agree the contribution in the third quarter was a little bit better year-over-year. But would go back to the commentary I just made around, a lot of that's driven by those newer customers that we moved in over the last 12 to 18 months and their contribution to that program really driving it versus a change in strategy or otherwise. Spenser Allaway : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you so much. Tom Boyle : Thanks, Spenser. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. Just on the acquisitions market, recognizing there hasn't been a ton of actual deals closing, but just curious on your expectations for cap rates. I believe earlier in the year you were looking for 6%-plus, initial yields or stabilized yields. So just curious if that's moved down as the general market has improved from a REIT's cost to capital perspective and rates have come down at least on the unsecured side. So just curious on your latest expectations on pricing and cap rates or where you'd be willing to do deals? Tom Boyle : Yeah. Thanks Juan. Good question. And I would generally say that the way you characterize it is pretty consistent and has been for some time, meaning that we're still looking for stabilized yields that are in the 6% sort of ZIP codes. And what that typically means is we're acquiring things in the fives. And, obviously, that was the case for Simply last year probably the largest private transaction that we've been speaking to, but that's been consistent for the last year or so and that's the current state of play. Obviously as more transactions occur here over the next couple of quarters we'll have more to talk about on cap rates. But that's the right sort of ZIP code to be thinking about. Juan Sanabria : Okay, great. And then just curious if you could talk a little bit about the strategy or thinking behind the COO hiring and what you expect the seat to bring or the person to bring as a result of the addition? Joe Russell : Yeah, sure. Obviously without question as you've seen and track the things that we're doing relative to our investment in all the tools, digital optimization, the advantages that we're continuing to deploy through our scale our brand and everything that again drives operations day-to-day, the leadership tied to that is incredibly critical as well. So we're excited about Chris Sambar joining us, great experience with a very solid career at AT&T for over 20 years, certainly understands many of the components of what drives our business particularly technology and infrastructure-related great experience with running large teams within the AT&T platform. In his last role he had over 25,000 employees reporting to him. So these are all key attributes that we're excited to bring into the senior leadership ranks. And we're very confident he's going to be able to put a strong mark on the business operations and otherwise. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Todd Thomas : Yeah. Hi, thanks. I wanted to go back to the promotions in the quarter and some of the commentary there and ask about the use of promotions in October as we think about the down 5% move-in rent and the improvement that you saw there relative to the third quarter. And then I think in the past you previously indicated that the use of promotions on some level may have attracted a slightly lower lifetime value customer. Has that changed now? Or are you seeing a better response and sort of stronger customer entering the portfolio with the use of promotions? Tom Boyle : Sure. That's a multipart question, there we'll get into. So in October, I'd say, year-over-year promotions pretty consistent to prior year. The driver of the promotions in the third quarter was just a different mix of promotions. So we used a little bit less of the 50% off and a little bit more of the dollar special. So -- and that's just more tactically on the ground. In terms of the promotions you're right, different promotions have different profiles. They attract customers and ultimately are used based on the amount of inventory we have to sell, the pricing dynamics in the local market and are tuned to try to maximize revenue over the medium-term in conjunction again with advertising and move-in rental rates. Todd Thomas : Okay. And then, my second question, I wanted to just ask or trying to try to clarify the occupancy update that you provided for October was that -- did you mean a decrease from September so down 90 basis points? Or do you mean that the year-over-year decrease at the end of October is down 90 basis points. Can you just clarify and maybe just provide an occupancy rate for where the portfolio sits today? Tom Boyle : Yeah. That's a good clarification there, Todd. What I was speaking to was 90 basis points year-over-year. And as we've talked about through this year, we had a little bit more occupancy up-tick through the summer and have anticipated a little bit more occupancy decline into the fall. And we've seen that play out kind of as anticipated. And we're anticipating through the year at our last outlook update we said, down 80 basis points on average. Given the increase in the outlook, it's probably down closer to 70 basis points on average through the year from here. But continue to see a closing of that gap overall on a year-over-year basis, but some different seasonal patterns through the year. And then in terms of quarter end occupancy or month end occupancy obviously we haven't closed the month of October, but it will be pretty similar to where we ended September. But obviously that's not a number that you often see. So -- but just seasonally you don't see a big move there, so just a touch lower than where we finished September. Todd Thomas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ron Kamdem : Hey, just following up on the stabilization comments. I think you talked about different markets and obviously move-in rents sort of improving. But anything on sort of the website data and the website visits any other sort of data points that are sort of confirming that story would be helpful. Tom Boyle : Yeah. So we've talked about industry-wide demand and that really reaching parity as we moved into September and October that's been really encouraging and we've continued to see good traction from web visits through our platform as well. Really a combination of strong web visits that are in positive territory year-over-year as well as good conversion rates frankly online and through our different channels to the store. Ron Kamdem : And then just my second one was I think you've been interesting stat on 70% to 75%. I think I heard that right through the channel. Just wondering as you're thinking about over the next three to five years is that sort of optimal? Is there more room there? And what the implication could be on cost savings? Tom Boyle : Yes. No, I think that's right. So, about 75% of our customers are utilizing a digital channel to complete their rental and that's a number that's grown pretty steadily over the last several years. And just a reminder, we're not providing any sort of incentive for customers to utilize that as the way to complete their rental agreement. But customers continue to embrace it and frankly more and more year-over-year. And so we're optimistic that more customers will choose that channel to complete their rental agreement before they arrive at the property over the next several years and that will lead to continued optimization alternatives that Joe spoke to earlier in terms of providing that win-win-win both for customers and how they choose to complete their rentals our employees and how we think about their career opportunities specialization and centralization that we've utilized as well as the financial impact. Joe Russell : Yes. And Ron I'd add too. It's certainly a very impactful channel and the infrastructure and the effectiveness of our digital platform is certainly playing through relative to speed, effectiveness, et cetera that customers are embracing. We also as I noted in my opening comments now have about 2 million users on our PS app that tool as well again is additive to the way customers are interacting with us is much easier from an account management standpoint, communication standpoint, et cetera. So, we're bolting on and building a very robust environment. The customers as Tom mentioned are not being incentivized by us to use these tools. They're telling us these are tools they want and they're gravitating to them very aggressively. So, we'll still provide when customers require it face-to-face interaction with again our skilled property managers at properties, but this is one additional way for them to have that much more of an effective transaction with us. And then from an ongoing relationship standpoint it's a different level of service we can provide them through the PS app as well. Ron Kamdem : Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Joe Russell : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi everyone. I don't think this has been talked about yet but we talked about acquisitions and the volume. It looks like guidance is reduced for the year but you mentioned the pent-up seller dialogue. So, is that just timing and you expect an above-average January or have some deals fallen off or some mixture? Tom Boyle : Yes, you hit it. It's just a timing element which is we have been anticipating that the transaction market would improve throughout the year and it has. But just in terms of the level of dialogue it's really picked up over the last 60 to 90 days. And so a good bit of the activity that we're speaking about is likely to fall in the start of 2025 versus finishing out closing in 2024. But obviously you saw we had under contract a pickup in acquisition volumes and we have more to come on that front as we close out the year, but some of it will slip into 2025. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. And then maybe just on your own development. I was wondering if you could give a sense of your own pace of development deliveries in 2024 and how you think that will end up comparing to 2025 and 2026. Is a pretty consistent increasing decreasing or your goals? Joe Russell : So, yes, Caitlin this will be a record year of deliveries for us from a development standpoint. So, we'll finish out 2024 with about $430 million of development deliveries that includes both ground-up new construction as well as redevelopment. The work and the timing of consistent level of deliveries year-to-year can be somewhat challenging particularly with many of the hurdles that we're facing with development across multiple markets, longer entitlement times, more complicated improvement processes, different areas of the business from a development standpoint, that create more risk and much of that's time related. So, we're going to see a bit of a drop going into 2025. And with that, we'll continue to work to elevate the amount of deliveries we'll see in 2026 and beyond. So the team's doing a great job, developing and redeveloping great new assets, giving us more scale in markets. And with the record amount of deliveries this year, it was a great bar to hit and we're going to challenge ourselves to match, if not exceed that in subsequent years. But 2025, we'll see a slight decrease in deliveries. Q \u2013 Caitlin Burrows : Thanks. Tom Boyle : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013 Brendan Lynch : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe on the labor front, how do you balance the labor saving -- cost savings versus the risk of reducing on-site staff too much? I'm sure, you're cognizant of this risk. Just how you monitor and how you think about it? Joe Russell : Yes. That's part of what we've been very diligent about making sure that we're using a variety of different tools analytically and otherwise to not only property by property understand, the impacts of the way that we've been changing our operating model, that may give us the opportunities as I've spoken about to reset the type of skills and labor that we have with properties to properties, but we've got growing sets of analytics that help to predictively look at staffing levels, because sometimes properties are busy for instance, beginning end of the month, or it could be because of some seasonality issues that may be different times of the month, different times of a week. So, we've got a lot of very interesting and growing analytics that are helping us optimize the ability to put our own people where we know they're going to be able to serve customers even more effectively. Part of that also relates to the specialized roles that our platform has been able to create within our property management ranks. So, a lot of great tools that give us the confidence, that we've got a very good balance. And as I mentioned earlier, customers are gravitating to this quite effectively as well. We've got a vibrant back channel that's become more and more effective through our care center, as well. So we've got many tools, even beyond just the amount of labor that's resident at a particular property that actually enhances the amount of service that we can provide to customers. Q \u2013 Brendan Lynch : Great. That's, helpful. And my other question is just on kind of market strength. Tom, you called out Seattle as being particularly strong. I think Florida, has been weaker in some of the past quarters. Maybe just give us an update on, which ones are performing best, which ones are still struggling a bit. Tom Boyle : Yes. So we've provided a good list of markets that have started to accelerate earlier in the year. So I mentioned Seattle, but the DCs and San Franciscos, as well. The markets that we've highlighted that are still working through normalization continue to be those that were really the highest flyers through the 2021 and 2022 time period. So a market like Atlanta, for instance, has that normalization, but also some new supply to work through. And so that's how I would characterize the performance. That said, even those markets that maybe are having a tougher go at it, if you look at overall changes in same-store revenue growth year-over-year you're starting to see some improvement in some of those markets like in Orlando, for instance. For the quarter, revenue was down 6.1%, but that's frankly starting to improve from there. And so, some of those initial indications of stabilization are occurring in a few of those markets as well, even those that had really strong performance in 2021 and 2022. On the West Coast of Florida, you highlighted Florida specifically, Joe highlighted the hurricane impact. We disclosed that that's likely to have about a $7 million impact financially. But at the same time, the customer traffic on the West Coast of Florida has impacted and we want to be there to help serve those customer bases as they seek to rebuild on the West Coast of Florida. And so we've seen an increase in move-in activity and occupancy there related to the storm activity and really the storm rebuilding. Q \u2013 Brendan Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Good morning. Just going back to some of the comments on stabilization. Correct me if I'm wrong but last October I thought you guys cut rates pretty deeply. So when you talk about stabilization. How do you take that into account? And when you look at rent trends sequentially does that paint a similar story of improvement? Tom Boyle : Yes. I think there's a few things there. One I'm giving you a rent number in October that is kind of an apples-to-apples rent number. And again we're looking for move-in rents to be in the kind of down single-digits towards the end of the year and I think we're on track for that. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And on the hurricane impact how much NOI benefit did you get on the portfolio level from people maybe moving in? Tom Boyle : Well I just highlighted the fact that actually we'll have a financial cost associated with the storms. And as I noted we are seeing some move-in activities, but I think it's too early to tell to talk about NOI impact overall. But no question we've had some cleanup work to do at a few of our properties that were impacted and those are getting right back online. Frankly most of them are back online serving customers as we sit right here. And as Joe mentioned relatively modest impact overall and relatively fortunate given where the storm came through. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. Going back to development. Can you talk a little bit about your land positioning and the visibility to kind of keep the development engine going? For example how many years of development starts do you control? Joe Russell : I'll speak in general terms Mike as far as our strategy around land holdings and then we can give you a little bit more color more specifically to your question. But what we more often than not do in a vast majority of the development transactions is we'll take control of a parcel depending on the timing for entitlements and other permitted processes you have to go through. We have a contractual option on the land. We don't own the property itself. So that's far more typical than just putting a big land inventory on our balance sheet. So we'll typically acquire a property. And again this would be a vacant parcel once we've gotten through what we feel are necessary and any risk-related improvements. So once we get to that point we'll go ahead and take ownership of the land site. But frankly more often than not we're literally ready to build as we do that. Tom I don't know if you got a specific number to point to relative to overall holdings but... Tom Boyle : Yes. We own about $60 million worth of land in that context given the strategy that Joe just highlighted. Mike Mueller : And out of curiosity that $60 million of land that gives you about what in terms of total expected investment what's buildable on that? Tom Boyle : Yes, that's going to give you ability. Obviously, part of our activity is redevelopment as well. So as you think about that $60 million that gives us visibility over the next couple of years. And as Joe mentioned, we've got an ability to see further than that based on the agreements we have in place with landowners. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Tom Boyle : Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments. Ryan Burke : Thank you, Rob and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Have a great Halloween and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",
