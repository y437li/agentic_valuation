Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP Operator : Good morning. My name is Tracy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares\u2019 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Todd Beekman, you may begin your conference. Todd Beekman : Thank you, Tracy and welcome. This is Todd Beekman, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides that we\u2019ll be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com. And this call is being recorded, and will be available for rebroadcast about an hour after the close of the call. Slides 2 and 3 note several aspects of basis of presentation. I encourage you to read these. Let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, and in that regard, I would direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to those comparable financial measures within the presentation, and additionally, earnings-related material can be found this morning and in Form 8-K filed today, all which can be found on our website. Turning to Slide 4, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to change risk and uncertainties, which may cause results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, the material we filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Now turning to today\u2019s presentation. As noted on Slide 5, the presenters today are : Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Controller; Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, who will also be participating in the Q&A portion of our call and Mac McCullough who has recently joined us as our CFO, is here with us today. So let\u2019s get started. Dave? David S. Anderson: Turning to Slide 6, Huntington had a good first quarter. We reported net income of $149 million or $0.17 per share. This resulted in a 1.01% return on average assets and in 11.3% return on average tangible common equity. We also achieved positive operating leverage and continue to be committed to having positive operating leverage for the full year. There were two significant items recorded in the first quarter that I will cover when I discuss noninterest expense. Fully-tax equivalent net interest income was $443 million, an increase of $13 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was due to a larger balance sheet partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. Average loans grew by $2.6 billion or 6%. Commercial and industrial loans grew by 4%, auto loans grew by 40% and residential mortgage loans grew by 8%. One item to note is that average commercial and industrial loan growth was negatively impacted by the $600 million reclassification that we made from loans to investment securities at the end of 2013. Average investment security balances grew $1.9 billion or 20%, as we prepare for the new Basel III liquidity coverage requirements. The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.27%, a decrease of 15 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The 15 basis point decrease resulted from a change in mix and yield of our earning assets, partially offset by lower funding costs. Noninterest income was $248 million, a decrease of $8 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. Mortgage banking income decreased by $22 million, or 49%. The year-ago quarter also included a $9 million gain on sale of low income housing tax credit investments, partially offsetting these items were higher security gains, service charges on deposit accounts and electronic banking fees. Security gains for the quarter were $17 million. In preparation for the January 2015, LCR requirements, we sold securities that were not qualified for liquidity coverage and reinvested into high quality liquid assets. The securities we sold had a fairly short remaining life, nearly all had a duration of less than two years and we would have seen more than 70% of this quarter\u2019s gains, flow through its net interest income by the end of this year. Service charges on deposits increased $4 million, and electronic banking fees increased $3 million over the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense was $460 million, an increase of $17 million or 4% from the year-ago quarter. The increase resulted from $22 million of significant items. Significant items in the quarter were $13 million of one-time merger-related expenses for the Camco acquisition and a $9 million increase in litigation reserves. Steve will cover OCR later in the presentation. Turning to Slide 7, I will cover credit trends later in the presentation. the provision expense was $25 million, a decrease of $5 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter due to improvement in our credit quality. Capital continues to be strong. at the end of the quarter, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.63%, down 28 basis points from the year ago and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at 10.63% was close to the year-ago levels. Slide 8 has a few additional first quarter highlights. First, Mac McCullough joined Huntington as our new CFO. Steve will provide a fuller introduction in a few minutes. Second, we closed and successfully converted the Camco acquisition. Third, last week we announced the acquisition of 11 branches in Michigan from Bank of America. We also received a no objection from the Federal Reserve for our proposed capital actions under CCAR. Side 9 is a summary of our quarterly earnings trends and key performance metrics. Slide 10 is a summary of the notable items that impact a comparison of the current quarter with the year-ago quarter. I covered most of these items in my previous comments. Slide 11 displays the trends in our net interest income and margin. Net interest income increased $13 million from the year-ago quarter. The net interest margin decreased 15 basis points due to a 22 basis point change from the mix in yield of our earning assets, partially offset by a 7 basis point reduction in funding costs. Having to add so many high quality liquid assets hurt the margin, but the larger pressure remains the competitive environment and fixed-rate loans renewing at current market yields. The right side of Slide 12 shows our deposit mix. On the left side of this slide, you will see the maturity schedule of our CD book, which represents a potential opportunity to continue to lower deposit costs as about $2.3 billion of CDs are maturing in the next 12 months at an average rate of 78 basis points and new CDs are currently coming out between 30 and 40 basis points. Slide 13 shows the trends in capital. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio decreased from 10.90% at December 31, 2013 to 10.63% at March 31, 2014. The decrease was due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases. They were partially offset by retained earnings and the stock issued in the Camco acquisition. During the first quarter of 2014, we repurchased 14.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $9.32. This completed the repurchase of $227 million of stock over the last four quarters. Yesterday, our Board authorized a new repurchase of up to $250 million of stock over the next four quarters that we\u2019ve included as part of our most recent capital plan. Slide 14 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit quality continues to show steady improvement and is in line with our expectation. Net charge-offs fell to 40 basis points well within our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Loans past due greater than 90 days remain very well controlled at 22 basis points and have been at a similar level over the last year. The nonaccrual loan ratio fell very slightly, while the nonperforming asset ratio experienced a modest increase due to the addition of $12 million of nonperforming assets from Camco. The criticized asset ratio continued to fall as the quarter saw a reduction from 4.49% to 3.78%.  : Reviewing Slide 16, the loan loss provision of $25 million was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter that was $18 million less than net charge-offs of $43 million. Overall asset quality improvement resulted in a reduction in the ACL for loan ratio from 1.65% last quarter to 1.56%. The ratio of ACL to nonaccrual loans fell modestly from 221% to 211%. We believe these coverage levels remain adequate and appropriate. : Let me turn the presentation over to Steve. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you, Dave. Our Fair Play banking philosophy coupled with our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR continues to drive new customer growth and increases in product penetration. This slide recaps the continued upward trend in consumer checking. This is Slide 17. Over the last year, consumer checking account households grew by 94,000 households or 7%. In the last quarter, the annualized growth rate was over 10%, but about a third of those households were from the Camco transaction that closed in March. The mid-to-high single-digit pace remains in line with the expectations we set nearly four years ago. Over this last year, we\u2019ve continued to focus on increase in the number of products and services we provide to those customers and the corresponding revenue. The charts that you\u2019re accustomed to see are in the appendix that the broader takeaway is that the strategy continues to drive in new customers and we are establishing deeper relationships. Turning to Slide 18, the new commercial relationships over the last, the net new growth was 2.6% as there are 4,000 new commercial customers banking with Huntington. You\u2019ll see that the last quarter had very limited growth and that tie directly to some changes that we\u2019ve made in our business banking checking products, which accelerated the closing of lower balance business checking accounts and we expect some additional closings throughout the remainder of the year. Our underlying growth with new business customers is strong. The customers that remain with Huntington have deeper relationships, the percentage of commercial customers with four plus products and services increased by 2% since December of last year. : Customers in particular businesses are feeling better than they did a year ago. Competition continues to be tough and we\u2019ve continued to selectively reduce large corporate portfolio, but our middle market especially verticals and auto lending businesses continue to see solid growth and strong pipelines. Auto loan originations volume remains good and had attractive yield of around 3%, the rest of the loan portfolio is expected to grow modestly and investment securities will continue to be rolled in the OCR compliant high liquidity assets. NIMs expected to be under continued pressure, but we expect net interest income to grow. Noninterest income excluding the net MSR impact and security gains is expected to be slightly lower than the seasonally low first quarter. As we commented on in January, we continue to refine our consumer checking products and in July, we\u2019ll make a change that we expect to negatively impact fee income by around $6 million per quarter. This approximate impact was in our previous expectations. Now putting these two items together, we expected total revenue to grow. Continued to the next page, noninterest expense including Significant Items will have some quarterly volatility as second quarter sees the full impact of Camco and this year\u2019s peak marketing expense along with the annual merit increase that occurs in May. The overall message remains that we\u2019ve remained diligent on controlling expenses and are committed to delivering full year operating leverage. : Turning to Slide 20, and as you\u2019ve heard me say, we\u2019re committed to positive operating leverage for the year. This slide lays out the results for the year-to-date and our adjusted total revenue is up about 2%. Adjusted expenses were down 1.6% it\u2019s too early in the year to claim our victory on operating leverage, but we wanted to provide with you an update to our progress. Before I turn it back to Todd for Q&A, I\u2019m very pleased to introduce our recently appointed CFO, Howell McCullough that I think many of you know him as Mac, and we\u2019ll be referring to Mac as we go forward. And some of you would know him through his role of Chief Strategy Officer at U.S. Bank, which by the way is a bank I admire for their consistency of results and disciplined approach to growth. And he is a great fit for us here at Huntington, Mac although, he earned his MBA from Wharton, he did his undergraduate degree from The Ohio State University and having grown up from in Columbus, he knows our markets well. That brings with him a commitment to customer advocacy, which has been a hallmark of Huntington since it was founded, he also has expertise in revenue growth, expense management and innovation, all these attributes we\u2019re seeking to take to the next \u2013 take Huntington to the next level. So, I\u2019ll close with a thank you to Dave Anderson, our Controller, did a super job stepping in as interim CFO, along with the accounting and finance teams, which all did outstanding job for the last year. Dave filled that interim CFO role wonderfully. So with that, back to you, Todd. Todd Beekman : Tracy, we\u2019ll now take questions. And I ask as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask one question and one related follow-up. for additional questions, he or she can go back to the queue. Thank you. Operator : : Kevin J. St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the changes to the consumer checking accounts, it\u2019s almost a 10% hit to the service charges. could you talk \u2013 tell us what those changes are? Stephen D. Steinour: We\u2019re going to be making a couple of changes, Kevin. first, we\u2019re going to allow all of our customers to transact up to midnight to cover any overdraft charges by making transfers again, through midnight in any of our channels, ATM, phone bank, digital whatever channel access they have. and then secondly, we\u2019re making an adjustment to how we post debit items. it\u2019s a bit involved, but it will work to the consumers to our customers\u2019 advantage, and I think give us even more transparency around that, as we go forward. Kevin J. St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, is it something that you would \u2013 is it something that you would anticipate that boost to the brands of the Fair Play strategy, and then you\u2019ll be able to leverage this a bit? Stephen D. Steinour: We certainly think it\u2019s completely in line with our Fair Play strategy, and will be helpful to us. I would point, Kevin, last year, we made a $30 million reduction in overdraft fees related to posting order changes, $30 million approximately. but as you saw the results for the year, the actual service charge fees were up about 6%. So we\u2019re getting signals that our customers and our ability to attract new customers really appreciate this Fair Play approach. and so that\u2019s in part why we decided to continue to roll out differentiating positions with our checking product. Kevin J. St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. First, really quick question on the reclassification of the loans and the securities was the 600 also the impact on average balances, such that if we had average of the 600 to the average, I think loan growth was up about 2.0%. Is that the right way to think about it? Stephen D. Steinour: Yes, it is. We reclassified $600 million at the end of December and then throughout the quarter as we got, we originated new assets, the balance increased about $673 million. but I think you\u2019re doing the math right. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And that was all in the commercial line, the C&I line. Stephen D. Steinour: Yes. It came out of C&I, and went into available-for-sale securities. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, perfect. And then just the follow-up question on the expense line, obviously comp was I guess very well controlled this quarter. Can you just run through the ups and downs? I think you have the merit increases in May, you had seasonally higher payroll taxes this quarter, and I know you have the pension expense or curtailment, I guess, when we sort of net that out and we should \u2013 we\u2019re sort of at a broadly sustainable level, or do we take up in second quarter and then I\u2019m just wondering how sustainable this level of comp expense is? Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour: I mean we will see a merit increase in May. we obviously continue to manage expense as well. but we will see that impact in May as we\u2019ve signaled. David S. Anderson: Ken, you\u2019ll also see some increased marketing, our marketing tends to be seasonal. and so that that will be an increase. and then finally, the Camco acquisition was brought in \u2013 brought on late in the first quarter. so that that will have some overheads associated with it as well. But that\u2019s been part of what\u2019s been in the expectations, frankly all of those has been in terms of the expectations and the Camco, there is the revenue as well. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, okay. thank you very much. Stephen D. Steinour: Okay. David S. Anderson: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Yes. Hi, this is Tom Shearer in for Ken. just want to see if I can get a little more color on loan growth within categories. we saw CRE pick up a little bit here. Is that sort of more of a function of lower runoffs, or are we actually seeing a base set in here, or how should we think about growth in that category and others going forward? Daniel J. Neumeyer: Yes. I think this is Dan. On CRE, we are seeing a pickup of activity, I think there has been the opportunities, multifamily retail, we\u2019re seeing more properties change hands. So I do think that over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve seen more opportunities there, that\u2019s within the profile we\u2019re looking for. Stephen D. Steinour: But Tom, to try and answer you more broadly, we\u2019ve had a very good quarter in terms of broad-based growth, we\u2019ve had growth in our middle market, our small business, a number of our verticals, healthcare, food and ag et cetera. So very broad-based. our large corporate book actually came in a little bit again, in the first quarter as I did through last year. and so I think this is a reflection of the economy and our footprint doing well, and the investments that we\u2019ve made in these verticals and other businesses continuing to mature. Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks. And just a quick cleanup on the share account, we saw the period end down, but the average slightly up. How should we think about that going forward? Stephen D. Steinour: We had the Camco acquisition in there. Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Right. Daniel J. Neumeyer: And the majority of the shares that we repurchased in the first quarter or after Camco, we\u2019re in a \u2013 we were required to stay on the market for a while, but most of the activity happened later in March. Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great, thanks. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP :  Good morning, guys. Stephen D. Steinour:  Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP :  Steve, I was just hoping you could touch a little more on just the notion of positive operating leverage. You guys made it last year. It looks like you\u2019ll be able to do it again, this year. But I guess absent any additional securities gains for example, the spread between revenue growth and expenses might start to narrow if I\u2019m interpreting the guidance correct. So you can still do it, but it will be kind of very modest operating leverage. When and how do you see that gap expanding more materially? Is it that 2015 is the year where it really kind of shines through and that you will have kind of a full year of no need to do investment spending on the branch build out, or how should we really think about that dynamic from your perspective? David S. Anderson:  This is Dave. Scott, I think that we think about the future, we\u2019re obviously having very good success in growing loans this quarter. we expect that to continue into 2014 and 2015. So that will help us. We talked about the factor we\u2019re still expecting the net interest income line to continue to grow. Our supermarket strategy, we expect it to break-even by the end of this year. So that will help us obviously from the positive operating leverage. And we are sensitive to short-term interest rates, a large percentage of our book is LIBOR-based, and our projections on interest rates will help as interest rates move up on the short part of the curve, that will help us as well. Stephen D. Steinour:  So none of our investments are mature. Scott, credit card for example was end of third quarter last year. There\u2019s a variety of areas that we\u2019ll continue to attribute and we come into the second quarter of the strong pipeline, much like we told you year-end, we came in to the first quarter with a strong pipeline. We would expect that to continue. We like the activities and the focus that we have going on throughout the company. So the execution is getting better. You think about that first quarter at least in our geography, not that we want to provide weather reports, but there were clear weather impacts into some of the results. So more to do, we\u2019ve got frankly a lot of ambitions and \u2013 but we think we had a good quarter and a trend now with pipeline and backlog in activities to be confident as we come into the second quarter. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP :  Okay, good. That\u2019s helpful, and I appreciate the color. And then I guess just as a follow-up, I want to make sure, I understand the loan growth dynamic correctly. Because of the Camco transaction, there\u2019s a little bit more of a gap than is typical between your end-of-period and average balances. And then the accounting change that you did end of last quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily help I guess. So it\u2019s just almost as simple as thinking the end-of-period, which is, I guess more of a double-digit annualized growth rate is just a much better proxy for what we should be expecting for overall loan growth than the more modest annualized growth if you just did the average numbers? Stephen D. Steinour:  Well. At the end-of-period, we\u2019d pick up Camco. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP : Yes. Stephen D. Steinour: So that would \u2013 that could be misleading if you just took a spot and not an average. But we had pretty good growth throughout the quarter. it ramped a bit, but it got a little better during the quarter. but it wasn\u2019t back-end loaded. So the \u2013 as we come into this quarter, we get essentially the same kind of pipeline to work with and to help you that the Camco loan portfolio is about $500 million of business and consumer. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP : Yes, okay. So maybe, just taking that out of the end-of-period is probably a pretty good proxy then for the kind of growth rate we could see going forward, it sounds like. Stephen D. Steinour: Yes, we can see, you\u2019ve got a couple of weeks in it, but that\u2019s all. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP :  Yes. Okay. All right, that\u2019s perfect. I appreciate the time. Stephen D. Steinour:  Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Daniel M. Delmoro \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey guys, you have Dan Delmoro [from Matt\u2019s team] (ph). Just a quick follow-up on C&I loan growth. Your outlook points to higher customer activity and some of the benefits from investments in your verticals. I just want to get a sense for how utilization rates trended throughout the quarter, and what you guys have been seeing in terms of pricing in terms in the space? Another regional bank pointed to some frothiness in the CRE space. So I wanted to see if you guys are seeing that as well. Daniel J. Neumeyer:  Yes. This is Dan. So, in terms of utilization it has been flat, which is actually a positive because we\u2019ve seen a couple of year trend of decreasing utilization. So, we believe that\u2019s leveled out and maybe pointed to an uptick, but definitely a change in direction there in the flattening. In terms of frothiness in the market, yes nothing has changed from last quarter, the market is as competitive as ever. And CRE in particular, yes, it\u2019s more aggressive, but given where \u2013 we have pretty modest growth targets there. So we are able to pretty much take on the credit that fits our profile and still withholding to loan-to-value debt service coverage ratios et cetera. The stress has been more on term and recourse, but the disciplines of debt service coverage and LTVs have held up well. And so, we like what we are adding to the book. Stephen D. Steinour:  And as we\u2019ve talked about before, we have concentration limits in place for a variety of our loan portfolios. But, we tend to articulate it around Commercial Real Estate as a concentration limit on these calls and the analyst sessions just to point out them. Daniel M. Delmoro \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, good morning guys. Just want to touch a little bit more on expenses, it sounded in the intro comments as if the expectations are not materially different, but when I read the guidance, it says you expect a slight increase from this quarter\u2019s level. I think last quarter you had said flattish around the second half of 2013, which was the same as this quarter. So, are you expecting a little bit higher expenses now than before or am I just getting too detailed? Daniel J. Neumeyer: : Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  No. That there is high and then you have highlighted several unusual items in our anyway seasonal pipe items in the second quarter. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of increase in the second quarter from the merit advertising in Camco acquisition all together? David S. Anderson:  Yes. This is Dave. Unfortunately, we did not give that type of guidance. Stephen D. Steinour: We just stay away from line item guidance. Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Stephen D. Steinour: But [good point] (ph) for asking, nice try. Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And then last question, I'll ask you guys sort of about the expenses and the positive operating leverages. You guys map it out on Slide 20. You make adjustments for the litigation and merger expenses, which is fair, but didn't back up the security gains this quarter. When you all think about positive operating leverage, do you think about security gains as a piece of that? Stephen D. Steinour: : : : Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Stephen D. Steinour:  These investments were short in duration. Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, everyone. Stephen D. Steinour: Good morning. Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Steve, regarding the change in Fair Play coming in July, what drove the decision to give more customers more time to get funds into their account. Was it any pressure from CFPB or just feedback from customers if 24 hours is not enough time? Stephen D. Steinour: Well, this is has nothing to do with CFPB. We were thinking about it as we came into the New Year as a way of sort of strengthening the positioning around Fair Play and as we saw last year, again with a posting order to change service charges were actually up during the course of the year, so and good growth in customers. So we\u2019re still learning, we\u2019re still testing, we still get \u2013 we seek and access customer feedback and the collective sense or judgment of the team was actually entirely consistent with the Fair Play approach, but we think also a good business in terms of \u2013 to get further strengthening Fair Play and uniqueness of 24-Hour Grace. In 24-Hour Grace, the vast majority of our customers never overdraw, but they all show a very strong emotional appeal around it when we survey. So we\u2019ll \u2013 so we thought it was a logical next step for us. Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : But do you think it's enough of a change to drive incremental share versus the 24 hours? Stephen D. Steinour: Well, it could be helpful to us in terms of both growth in customers, but also a share of wallet. We continue to refine our efforts around share of wallet. Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Just a question regarding compliance with liquidity coverage ratio, what\u2019s the approximate dollar balance of higher liquid securities that you still need to add and what\u2019s the timing to get there? Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour: So the overall portfolio, the securities portfolio is the absolute level today, is about the level it needs to be and as we look over the course of the year of the principal and interest of the non-qualified that roll through, we\u2019ll reinvest that back into qualifying assets and on target to be there by the end of the year. So we\u2019ve said that it\u2019s about $100 million, $125 million a month in interest and amortization. And so that will cycle now throughout the year. We do have some legacy assets that would not be high qualified, and so that may continue to be a modest amount of substitution, but as we\u2019ve said in the year-end call we wanted to get the portfolio positioned in aggregate during the fourth quarter for a number of reasons, including the potential scarcity of some of the product we were looking for. Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. So just remixing the rest of the year should be enough. Okay thank you. Stephen D. Steinour: I think so. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hey, thanks good morning. Stephen D. Steinour: Good morning, Craig. Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : So just a follow-up to the last question on the LCR. On the funding side, should we expect any additional run-off of collateralized municipal deposits? And I'm wondering, did anything on the liability side related to LCR drive the consumer pricing changes that we should expect in July? Stephen D. Steinour: Well, the decisions in July around our Fair Play philosophy had nothing do with LCR. In fact until you mentioned it, I hadn't thought of it in that context. So that's how remote it was. We had been working over the last year, year and a half to adjust collateralized deposits, and certainly as we see final guidance come out we may further reduce or adjust them, but we\u2019ve made meaningful progress during that period of time. And we may have some other approaches to it, home loan Bank, LCD or other things for very meaningful relationships. Deeply crustal, significant treasury management and things like that that we choose to protect. Don\u2019t see it as a huge issue for us at this point, Craig. Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : And then on your prior comment, you mentioned $125 million per month that you're going to reinvest from the securities portfolio into Ginnies. That nets to $1.5 billion. Should we think about that roughly as the increase over the next 12 months? And then the delta when you think about NIM is maybe a 20 basis point difference between the average Fannie/Freddie security and Ginnie? Stephen D. Steinour: We didn\u2019t mean to imply further growth in that portfolio. This is normal and monthly interest and if you will, principal repayment or amortization of the existing portfolio that we would look to reinvest to hold the portfolio at roughly the $11 billion level that it\u2019s at today. Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  So, Steve, so you hold it at $11 billion, but there's a $1.5 billion mix shift from the Fannie and Freddie portion to the Ginnie portion. And the net I think interest income delta on that is maybe 20 basis points because the Ginnies are yielding something lower. That was kind of my quick math. Stephen D. Steinour: But it\u2019s not all coming out of Fannie/Freddie to be sure, and it\u2019s got a variety of coupons around it and the durations maybe a little different as we look at reinvest. We do not intend to take a lot of market risk and we haven\u2019t in the last five years, but so we\u2019ve a number of things to work with, I wouldn\u2019t do the 20 bps Craig, but we don\u2019t try and provide specific guidance. So just in that context, I think you did a bit severe. Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Okay. Great thanks for the color Steve. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey good morning guys. Stephen D. Steinour: Good morning. Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just a question on the buyback strategy. When we think about the repurchases that occurred over the past couple of quarters, you guys flowed the buybacks for two quarters. Granted I understand that there was impact from Camco, and then you obviously completed the offering this quarter when you billed back $136 million. So can you just help, as we think about the $250 million approval that you got for this year, can you help us understand the philosophy from here? I know there was a lot of talk around sensitivity above tangible book value. Is that still the main primary factor in determining whether or not you're going to \u2013 how aggressive you are and or is it the fact that you're continuing to generate capital at a pretty fast pace that you want to prevent the capital base from growing? So, any color you could provide on that would be helpful? Stephen D. Steinour: Let me start broadly with that Ryan if we could. First of all, we think we have a strong capital position. We\u2019re sitting with excess capital today. And our approach has been grow the course as the capital there to support growth, secondly, to support dividend and third, for other activities, buyback, M&A, et cetera. In that context as we talked about the year-end earnings, we had a number of discussions at Board management about buyback approach and we refined or adjusted that approach which we communicated, certainly attempted to communicate at the year-end call. And so there are a number of additional factors than just a tangible book value that we are looking at. We haven\u2019t gone into those in great detail, but we have refined our thinking, broadened it quite a bit and that remains consistent as we go from first quarter now into second. And Dave pointed out we had this little hiatus around the Camco acquisition that\u2019s required, but other than that executed against that refined approach during the first quarter. So we carry that approach into the second quarter and beyond, I guess, it\u2019s second through first quarter with the CCAR approval. Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And I guess just a question on auto. I notice that you've \u2013 maybe I'm looking too far into this. I noticed in the release you are no longer stating that you won't be doing any auto securitizations. And I think the wording in the outlook around indirect auto loan growth changed slightly. Has your thinking \u2013 has pricing changed at all for loan sales such that the economics make more sense to consider? Is there anything LCR-driven that has changed your outlook, or is it just that you're seeing improving loan growth in other areas such that you don't need as much auto loan growth to support balance sheet growth? Stephen D. Steinour: When we entered the year, we tried to communicate that we did not anticipate an auto securitization this year that we had room under our concentration limit that would take us into 2015. And like the asset yield and other risk dimensions of autos versus alternative investments, and that thinking hasn\u2019t changed and wasn\u2019t a function of LCR. Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. If I could sneak in one other quick one, Steve. Given that your original fee income guidance did contemplate the $6 million quarterly decline in service charges, and you highlighted the fact that, despite last year's policy changes, you were able to grow service charges 6%. So my question is there still enough momentum in the fee income line, given the things that you're doing in Fair Play, that we could actually end up seeing core fee income growth, or are the policy changes along with the decline of mortgage still too hard to overcome? Stephen D. Steinour:  Well, as we\u2019ve said in the full year outlook, net interest income will be up, will swim through whatever margin compression, fee income will be modestly down if not flat, trying to overcome mortgage, the mortgage position. But when we gave that earning outlook, we had contemplated the decision that we\u2019re sharing today around further adjustments to the overdrive line item and so the overall guidance doesn\u2019t change. We\u2019re consistent with that and so the combination of those factors and managing expenses will put us inline with what we originally said. Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great and thank you for taking my questions. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Hey guys thanks, good morning. Stephen D. Steinour: Good morning, Jon. Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Good morning, Mac. Howell D. McCullough III : Good morning, Jon. Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC:  Welcome to Huntington. Stephen D. Steinour: : Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Yes. It's not the same here without Mac in town. Just a little more granular on the commercial lending, I'm particularly interested in the customer outlook for borrowing among the manufacturers and also their appetite for CapEx borrowing. Stephen D. Steinour: Yes. I would say it\u2019s improving, I think there is \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen huge changes yet, but I do think there\u2019s a developing confidence out there and more potentially to look at capital investment, I think it shows up in our middle market loan growth in our equipment finance loan growth. So I do think there are signs of that developing confidence and I think that helps form our outlook for the balance of the year. Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And then just to follow-up on that, in terms of your specialty verticals, how is the \u2013 I have to get the name right \u2013 but the foreign subsidiary business going? Are you seeing increase in activity there? David S. Anderson: We are seeing some activity; the thing we like about our verticals is that the growth is coming from all of them. we\u2019re not relying on any one to kind of outperform. We\u2019re seeing traction starting to develop in all of them, and foreign non-subs is a contributor. it is not huge, but we are starting from kind of ground zero. So we like the developing pipeline there and what we\u2019ve added to the book thus far. Stephen D. Steinour: Jon when we talk about investments not mature, these specialty businesses or verticals, none of them are mature. And we\u2019ve been doing this now for a number of years. we did three at the end of 2012, but there were a series of them before. they all have growth potential for us and they\u2019re all coming on. Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. thank you. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. David J. Long \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey guys, it\u2019s Dave Long. Stephen D. Steinour: Hey, Dave. David J. Long \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Just the one question that I still have remaining was regarding the expectations, Steve, and you talked about expectations for net interest income to grow moderately and noninterest income and expenses to be slightly higher from the current levels. Just to confirm, does that include the impact of Camco then, or is that simply looking at it organically? Stephen D. Steinour: That\u2019s the organic, but we also have enrolled Camco into that. David J. Long \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. so Camco is built into the \u2013 that sort of guidance if you want to call it back. Stephen D. Steinour: Camco is included. David J. Long \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you, okay. that\u2019s all I have \u2013 that I have got left. Thanks guys. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you, Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, thank you. Just I know you didn\u2019t want to give any sort of specific guidance on the OpEx impact from Camco for full quarter in Q2, but could you \u2013 maybe, you\u2019ve already mentioned this, sorry if I missed it. But what was the actual impact on OpEx this quarter from Camco for roughly a month or so? Stephen D. Steinour: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve broken it out, it\u2019s not material. It\u2019s $500 million in loan, $600 million in deposits, net of 11 branches, so we\u2019re not trying to \u2013 it\u2019s just not material. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC :  Okay, that\u2019s fair. I was just thinking that might help a little bit with Q2, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a big number, so that\u2019s fine. And the other question was a again, relatively small number, but your litigation reserve charge of $9 million. Can you just give a sense of what that ties into, this new litigation or existing litigation that you reserve for? David S. Anderson: this is Dave. as in the past, we just don\u2019t comment on litigation matters. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Well, those are the two questions I had. Thank you. David S. Anderson: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP : Hello. Just a quick question on the changes to the deposit service charges, what is the working you\u2019ve done around how long you think this is expected to take for those to become earnings positive, so you recover what you lose in the service charges and other fees or other revenue? Stephen D. Steinour: We haven\u2019t taken it at an account level in terms of what we\u2019re prepared to share this morning. we have seen a fair amount of the elasticity around customer behavior, as we made adjustments last year, for example and so that has been given us an ability to model it and perhaps in some unique ways about the consumer behavior. Remember, our approach has been customer acquisition and share of wallet and I would increasingly, the focus for us is around revenue based share of wallet. and you\u2019ll hear us talk about that more commonly as we go forward. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP : And then how much that you think there is to go on these fee initiatives and initiatives to become more customer-friendly, I mean you\u2019ve done quite a bit already. Do you think there is a lot more that you can do or you could think any further initiatives are going to be kind of small and incremental? Stephen D. Steinour: While we test and learn, and as we said, we survey and get feedback, there is nothing large on the horizon at this point, and I wouldn\u2019t say never, but it\u2019s not obvious to us what or when we might do something else now. so I think for purposes of modeling, certainly through the rest of this year, there is not another wave of activity that we\u2019re contemplating. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP : Thanks very much. Stephen D. Steinour: Yes. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve for closing comments. Stephen D. Steinour: Thank you very much. So we think we had a solid start to the year. we\u2019re grateful for your interest today, keep in your way above 1% was \u2013 is an objective and although it depressed a bit as we built the securities designed to meet the new liquidity rules. we\u2019re pleased with results. The customer activity in particular, that\u2019s translated into balance sheet growth, bodes well for us as we move forward. The Camco acquisition closing integration, doing that smoothly was a nice step along with this recently announced branch acquisition in Michigan. So each one of these, while not being significant, they add a bit to the balance sheet, 1% or so to the balance sheet, and while not being particularly significant. they do help us strengthen us over time, give us more density, and deliver modest improvements in our efficiency ratios. So we\u2019re going to continue to execute [Technical Difficulty]",

Turning to Slide 5, the presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Mac McCullough, our CFO; Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will all be participating in the Q&A portion. Let's get started, turning to Slide 6. Steve? Steve Steinour : Thank you for joining us today. Huntington had a great second quarter. We executed our strategies and delivered strong results. The industry is dealing with the challenging environment, but this is a quarter when many of our cylinders were firing and demonstrates how many of the investments we've made over the last several years are paying off. We reported net income of $165 million, a 9% increase from the year-ago quarter, and EPS of $0.19 per common share, or a 12% year-over-year increase. This represented a 107% return on average assets and a nearly 12.5% return on tangible common equity. Fully taxable equivalent revenue increased $33 million, or 5% year over year. Net interest income increased $35 million, or 8% year over year, while non interest income remained relatively flat, despite the $11 million headwind in mortgage banking. Net interest income benefited from two items. Our investments in our auto and commercial segments drove a $3.8 billion, or 9% increase, in loans. And we had to add nearly $2.6 billion of incremental securities as we prepare for the upcoming Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio or LCR rules. The benefit of the larger balance sheet was partially offset by a 10-basis point decrease in the net interest margin. Non interest expense increased $13 million, or $20 million less than revenue. Our efficiency ratio improved to 62.7%, and while this remains above our long-term target, we continue to focus on driving positive operating leverage. We've achieved positive operating leverage year to date and we remain committed to positive operating leverage for the full year. I will cover OCR in more detail later in the presentation, but we continue to gain market share and share of wallet. Our robust customer growth and OCR sales process are driving long-term shareholder value. Turning to slide 7, our credit quality continues to trend favorably. Our capital ratios remain strong. At the end of the second quarter, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.38%, down 38 basis points from a year ago, while our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.26%, down 45 basis points from a year ago. Both of these reductions reflect the combination of our disciplined balance sheet growth and strong capital management over the past year. This quarter, we repurchased 12.1 million common shares at an average cost of $9.17 per share. With the common stock dividend and buybacks combined, we returned 97% of second-quarter earnings to common shareholders. Slide 8 has a few additional first-quarter highlights. First, we announced the acquisition of 24 branches in Michigan from Bank of America early in the quarter, and within 60 days we received OCC approval for the acquisition. We are targeting a September close and conversion for this transaction. For the second year in a row, we were recognized for having the highest customer satisfaction rating in the north central region in a JD Power survey of retail banking customers. The customers' experience is a significant differentiator in this industry and this is just the latest acknowledgment of the great job our colleagues do on a daily basis, providing best-in-class service. We maintained our position as the number one SBA lender in the country, by the number of loans through the first nine months of the SBA's fiscal year. Small business lending is a core competency of Huntington. All of these loans are made to companies in our footprint. Finally, we were pleased to announce the addition of Eddie Munson to our Board of Directors. The Board looks forward to tapping his knowledge, not just a 32-year accounting professional, focused on regional banks, but also a business and civic leader in Detroit and eastern Michigan. With that, let me turn it over to Mac for a more detailed review of the numbers. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide 9 is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. Steve already touched on several of these, so let's move on to slide 10 and drill into the underlying details. Relative to last year's second quarter, revenue increased $33 million, or 5%, to $717 million. Spread revenues accounted for the entire increase, as net interest income increased 8% to $467 million. Average earning assets increased 12% year over year to $57.1 billion, driving net interest income growth. While we've been building the securities portfolio in preparation for the upcoming Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, loan growth drove the majority of the earning asset growth. The net interest margin compressed 10 basis points year over year to 3.28%. Earning asset yields compressed 15 basis points year over year, including 3 basis points of compression due to the larger investment securities portfolio, offset by 4 basis points of benefit due to an interest recovery on a credit-impaired acquired commercial real estate loan. Funding costs improved by 5 basis points. Second quarter fee income was $250 million, which represented a $2 million decline, or less than 1% from the year-ago quarter. The benefits of our robust customer acquisition were evident, as service charges on deposit accounts increased 7% year over year and electronic banking increased 13%. Other income increased $7 million, or 25% year over year, primarily related to various commercial loan fees given the strong lending activity during the quarter, as well as fees related to our consumer and commercial credit card products. As a reminder, we introduced our commercial and consumer credit card products in the second and third quarters of 2013 respectively and we are very pleased with progress to date. These items helped offset the continued pressure on mortgage banking income, which declined $11 million, or 33%, from the year-ago quarter, as refis continue to decline and the majority of the volume shifts to the purchase market. Non interest expense was $459 million, an increase of $13 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter. The largest contributor was a $9 million, or 92% increase in professional services, of which $5 million was one-time consulting expense related to strategic planning. Outside data processing and other services and equipment expense both increased $4 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily related to technology investments to support growth initiatives. Personnel expense was down $3 million, or 1% from the year-ago quarter, as the curtailment of our pension at the end of last year more than offset the impact of increased salary expense this quarter. Slide 11 displays the trends in our earning asset mix, net interest income and net interest margin. Average loans increased $3.7 billion, or 9% year over year. This increase included $0.5 million from the Camco acquisition. Commercial and auto remained the primary drivers of our loan growth, although we experienced growth in every portfolio except other consumer, a relatively small portfolio. Average commercial and industrial, or C&I, loans grew 7% year over year. More than half of the increase occurred in our specialty lending verticals, all of which continue to mature and gain traction. Business banking and our auto dealer floor plan lending were other key contributors to the growth. Also recall that approximately $600 million of C&I loans were reclassified into investment securities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013. The auto loan portfolio grew $2.1 billion, or 39%, from the year-ago quarter as originations remain strong and we continue to portfolio all of our production. As you can see on the auto loan slide in the appendix, we did not sacrifice credit quality to drive this volume. With respect to our auto finance business, I want to remind you that the summer months are seasonally strong. On the other hand, the auto floor plan lending side suffers during this period, as dealers liquidate the prior year's models to make room for the new model year in the fall. While our overall utilization rate ticked up modestly in the quarter, our auto floor plan loan utilization rates have been running a couple percentage points below what we would normally expect, but the strong automobile market in general has more than offset this. Also during the second quarter, our equipment finance business achieved a notable milestone, as total assets, both loans and securities related to this business, exceeded $3 billion for the first time. Turning to slide 12, the right side of the slide shows our deposit mix, while the left side lays out the maturity schedule of our CD book. Average core deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 4% year over year. This increase includes $0.5 billion from the Camco acquisition. For the last several years, we have focused on increasing low cost core deposits while reducing our dependence on high cost CDs. Average demand deposits increased $0.6 billion, or 3% year over year, while average money market deposits increased to $2.6 billion, or 17%. Growth in these categories more than offset the intentional $1.3 billion, or 28%, decrease in average, core certificates of deposits. There continues to be opportunity to drive an improvement in the mix, but as you can see over the next four quarters, we have approximately $2.2 billion of CDs maturing. This is about half the amount compared to this time last year. Another important piece of the funding mix dynamic that you do not see on this slide is the $3.6 billion year-over-year increase in short- and long-term borrowings, $2.5 billion of which was banked in holding company debt issued over the past year. As we continue to focus on remixing our deposit base and managing our overall cost of funds, we expect to continue to be active in the debt markets. Slide 13 shows the trends in capital. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio decreased from 10.71% at June 30, 2013 to 10.26% at June 30, 2014. The decrease was due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases that were partially offset by retained earnings and the stock issued in the Camco acquisition. During the second quarter of 2014, we repurchased 12.1 million shares of stock at an average cost of $9.17 per share. Over the past four quarters, we have repurchased 28.6 million common shares. Following the $111 million of buybacks this quarter, we have remaining capacity for $139 million of potential buybacks through the end of the 2015 first quarter under our $215 million repurchase authorization. Slide 14 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs fell noticeably in the quarter to 25 basis points, aided by lower consumer charge-offs, particularly in home equity and residential mortgage. Commercial charge-offs remain stable. Loans past due greater than 90 days remain very well controlled at 30 basis points. Nonaccruals were down slightly in the quarter, while the criticized asset ratio fell modestly as well. The criticized asset ratio includes the results of the shared national credit exam and also incorporates ratings activity on a significant portion of the portfolio reviewed upon receipt of year-end financial statements as the second quarter is the most active for credit renewals and reviews. All of these ratios are operating within our normalized targets and the allowance in associated coverage ratios remain adequate and in line with previous quarter levels. Slide 15 shows the trend in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates continued improvement, albeit at a reduced rate, as we are operating within a more normalized range. We do expect some modest improvement over the upcoming quarters. The chart on the right shows the NPA inflows, which are also fairly even with the prior quarter. Reviewing slide 16, the loan loss provision of $294.4 million was up modestly from the year-ago quarter and nearly equal to charge-offs in the second quarter. The allowance-to-loan ratio fell very modestly to 1.50% from 1.56% in the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans ticked up slightly from 211% to 213%. The level of the allowance is adequate and appropriate and reflects the stable to improving credit trends discussed earlier, along with increasing loan volume. In summary, we had a very solid credit quarter with performance at the low end of our long-term expectations. Let me now turn the presentation back over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Mac. Turning to slide 17, our fair play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship, or OCR disciplines, continue to drive new customer growth and improve product penetration. This slide illustrates the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households. Over the last year, consumer checking account households grew by 100,000 households, or 8%. During the second quarter, the annualized growth rate was almost 10%, illustrating that our momentum is sustained. The strategy is not just about market share gains, but also gains in share of wallet. We continue to focus on increasing the number of products and services we provide to these customers and the corresponding revenue. Our OCR cross-sell measure of six or more products and services improved to almost 49% this quarter, up more than 200 basis points from a year ago. Our consumer checking account household revenue is up 7% year over year. Turning to slide 18, while the chart on this slide appears to show a plateau in our acquisition of new commercial relationships over the past couple of quarters, I would remind you that we expected this to occur, as it ties directly to some changes we made in our business banking checking products, which have and will accelerate the closing of about 10,000 lower balance business checking accounts over the course of this year. Our underlying growth of new business customers remains strong. We also continue to progress in the deepening of our commercial relationships. The percentage of commercial customers with cross-sell of four plus products or services now exceeds 41%, an improvement of approximately 500 basis points from a year ago. Our commercial relationship revenue is up 18% year over year. Turning to slide 19, our expectations for the second half of the year remain similar to what we laid out in January, after accounting for seasonality. Our local economies continue to recover and confidence has improved among our customers, particularly business. Competition remains challenging and we've seen some moderation in the pull-through rates from pipeline to booking, but we expect continued success in commercial and auto lending to drive overall loan growth, as pipelines remain robust. Our recent investments in specialty lending verticals continue to mature, and our commitment to middle market and small business remains a cornerstone of the Company. Auto loan origination volumes are strong, although new money yields continue to compress modestly, recently in the range of 2.9%. We are continuing to monitor the securitization markets, as we've said before, and we'll look to use it as a tool to manage our overall concentration. We'll continue to reinvest cash flows from investment securities into LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets. The NIM is expected to remain under pressure, but we expect net interest income to grow as earning asset growth more than offsets the NIM compression. Non interest income, excluding the net MSR impact, is expected to remain near the second quarter's level. This includes the previously disclosed $6 million quarterly negative impact from a change in our consumer checking products that we will implement later this month. We also expect non interest expense, excluding one-time items, will remain near the second quarter's reported level. We will continue to look for ways to reduce expenses, while not impacting our previously announced growth strategies, or our high level of customer service. On the credit front, nonperforming assets are expected to experience continued improvement. We expect net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points, while provision was below our long-term expectation during this past quarter. Both are expected to continue to experience modest changes, given their absolute low levels. Turning to slide 20, as you can see, we're off to a solid start in terms of operating leverage for 2014, and we are committed to positive operating leverage for the full year. Year to date, adjusted total revenue is up about 3%. Adjusted expenses were up less than 1%. We remain focused on this metric. We still have a lot of work to do over the second half of the year, but I'm pleased with our year-to-date progress. With that, I turn it back over to Todd. Todd Beekman : Operator, we'll now take questions. We ask, for the courtesy of your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow up. Then if the person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back to the queue. Thank you. Tiffany? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Mac McCullough :  Erika, hi, this is Mac. Thanks for the question. We are comfortable, as we said, with taking a look at the second quarter run rate excluding one-time items and thinking about that as a base going forward. We do have a number of items that will impact the expense related to the growth initiatives around technology investments and those types of things going forward as well. We're comfortable working both sides of the equation on the efficiency ratio. Clearly, revenue is going to be a focus. We continue to look for opportunities to become more productive as well. Generally, we're going to continue to make the right investments to grow the top line, but understand that it's important to drive operating leverage and that clearly is going to be the focus going forward. Erika Najarian \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Mac McCullough :  We feel like we're really well positioned for LCR. We got ahead of this late last year. If you take a look at the investment security portfolio, it's up 28% year-over-year. We've got about $100 million a month that's maturing and we're putting back into the right type of product in the investment security portfolio.  So I think to the extent we see earning asset going forward, growth, it will come in the loan portfolio. There might be modest increases in investment securities, but we do feel that we're pretty well positioned there. Erika Najarian \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Your line is open. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners:  Steve or Mac, I was hoping, maybe, first question is just on the BAC branches, if you could just talk to us a little bit about your accretion or dilution expectations? The reason I ask is branch deals have been near-term/long-term story over the last few years, as there haven't been a ton of opportunities to deploy the funds, but you're seeing quite strong loan growth, right? Just wondering if there are more opportunities to deploy that? If that changes your modeling, or overall how you're thinking about the accretion and dilution over the next year or so? Steve Steinour :  Scott, it's 24 branches, as you know, and it's deposit only. We would expect to put our lending products in literally day one. We will get to a more balanced equation over time within those branches, as we do all of our branches.  Again, it's 24, so this is not going to move the needle hugely for us as we go forward. It will be helpful, and it will be accretive. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners:  Okay, perfect. Then wanted to ask just a separate question on capital management. Just given that this was the first year you went through the CCAR specifically, as opposed to the CapPR. Just was curious, Steve, if you could go through your attitudes, particularly as it relates to the 30% dividend payout limit, just as you looked at your own ask, so to speak? Then, Mac, I know when you were at USB, you weren't necessarily driving the CCAR, but you've been through more CCARs at another organization. So just curious how you think about things as you look to the next several months and you go through your CCAR as well? Steve Steinour :  As we approach CCAR, I think it was third quarter of last year, Scott, we said we were going to be conservative with the ask first time through. Wanted to make sure we got through and were able to move forward. I think we were consistent with that. The timing of the dividend reflects that, as we discussed on an earlier call, the dividend increase. It was an event we had prepared for substantially in 2012. The bar keeps moving, changing, raising. So there are always learnings from something like this and more work to do, and we're engaged with that and expect to continue to be able to manage through that process in a consistent fashion. We will be challenging ourselves to drive with consistency over the years through CCAR and therefore, continuing to learn and invest where we need to to bolster it. Mac, what would you add from your prior perspective? Mac McCullough :  I would say, Scott, I'm very pleased with where we are and how we came through last year's process. What I do know from my previous experience is that this is a journey and that we're going to continue to see the bar raised. I think the important thing is that we know where to focus as we think about 2015, and I think we know what we need to do. I feel very good about the progress that Huntington has made and where we are on the process. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners:  Okay. That's perfect. I appreciate all the color, guys. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  Maybe I could start, regarding the auto loan securitization commentary being added back to the outlook slide, are you guys thinking maybe one of these in the second half and maybe $1 billion plus? Just wanted to know your thoughts there? Steve Steinour :  We have said now for probably a year and a half that we have a concentration limit on auto, and as we continue to grow, we don't plan, at least at this point, to change that concentration limit. That would take us to loan securitizations, one or more, in 2015. We're viewing the market now and our lending is robust. There is the possibility we could do something the second half of this year. Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  Okay. Steve Steinour :  Although we're not planning it at the moment. Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  Got you. Somewhat related question, on the floor plan business, I know that's typically weak in the third quarter as dealers make room for the new model year. With your comments that line utilization was below the normal level, are you signaling to us that you might not see that typical seasonal decline? Steve Steinour :  No, we'll see that, for sure. Sales have been so good in the second quarter, that seasonal decline may have even advanced a little bit in the second quarter. Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  In terms of expenses, what's changed? I know your guidance doesn't seem like it changed. It was a little higher than what we were looking for. Your guidance, obviously, is for expenses to stay at these levels. It seems that there's been some upward pressure on the absolute dollar expenses versus last quarter. What's driving that? Mac McCullough :  Ken, this is Mac. Really, I don't think there's anything unusual in what's here. Obviously, we've had some one-time items related to the acquisitions, and we continue to make the investments and recognize the expense related to the historic investments. Again, I think where we're at in the second quarter represents a good run rate, thinking about removing the one-time items. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Understood. I was just thinking versus last quarter, if we had the same conversation, modest up would have put us still below where we're at, or currently. That's okay. Then, just same thing on the guidance on net interest income. I think you were saying modestly higher. Given the very good growth this quarter in NII, does that imply that you expect a slightly more stable outlook for the second half? Just wondering how you're thinking about that? Mac McCullough :  I think from a net interest income perspective, we will see growth. It will be driven entirely by earning asset growth, because the NIM will be under pressure. We'll continue to see repricing on the C&I book and that will be the primary source of that pressure. The earning asset growth, based on the robust pipelines that we see in C&I and continued strength in auto lending, will drive the net interest income growth offset by margin pressure. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : That's growth from second quarter levels, not just year-over-year? Mac McCullough :  That's from second quarter levels. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Perfect. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Asset Management :  I was hoping that you could talk about risk adjusted margins in the auto lending business at this point in the cycle? I think you said new money yields were coming on at 2.9%, but was hoping you could give some context around how the economics of the business look when you factor in credit and funding costs? Along those lines, I can't tell from the vintage performance data on slide 52, but was hoping you could comment on what kind of peak loss trends you're seeing in auto and whether peak losses have started to rise again? I know there's a lot there, but any flavor or color around what's happening would be great? Mac McCullough :  It's Mac. Given our business model in the auto business, I think given the quality of our portfolio where the FICO is in that 765 range, on a credit-adjusted basis, we really are performing extremely well. You take a look at the history, even through the cycle, our losses have been stellar. If you take a look at it today with 16 basis points of net charge-offs against the yield we're receiving on that portfolio, given the environment, that's actually attractive relative to other alternatives. So, I'm not sure we're seeing a turn in terms of quality as it relates to our portfolio on a go-forward basis. We're comfortable with the net risk-adjusted yield given the environment and our business model. Steve Steinour :  We've been consistent with the model over the years, Bill, so that the predictability of this has been quite strong. Even though we've expanded and our volumes are up, both the proprietary model and the FICO, when we show you the FICO, give us confidence in the performance. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Asset Management :  That's very helpful. Thank you. If I may, with a follow up, do you foresee any implications for the securitization markets as we approach the point where the Fed begins to withdraw liquidity from the system? If you could talk about what kind of impact you expect to your deposit base? That would be great. Mac McCullough :  It's Mac. We have a very large, stable retail deposit base that we feel very comfortable with in our rising rate environment. We also have fairly low dependence on large commercial deposits, if you take a look at it from a granularity perspective. We are looking, obviously, at different products and different opportunities that we would take advantage of in a rising rate environment. We do feel like we're positioned well, given the nature of our deposit base and the makeup of our retail versus wholesale funding. Steve Steinour :  Bill, our strategies were launched in 2009. We've had a run of where we've been emphasizing share of wallet, deep relationships. A lot of our penetration of our customer base, involves multiple deposit related on the consumer side, like debit products. We think we've got a very sticky base. We continue to emphasize share of wallet, and the objectives around that historically were extending the average life of deposits. We have been at it for years. We look at our larger deposits, and we are fairly unconcentrated. We've been, in the context of LCR, shifting our deposit mix further as it relates to the collateralized deposits, to government entities and others over the last year and a half. We think we're in very good shape. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Asset Management :  Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.: Mac McCullough :  It's Mac. This is primarily related to the concentration limits. We've been growing that portfolio very nicely. Again, we're very pleased with the growth and the portfolio itself. Moving to securitization later this year, definitely in 2015, will be all about concentration. Steve Steinour :  As we said a year and a half ago, we like the yield and duration on these assets comparatively, and we still do. Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.: Okay. Could you tell me what debt to income typically looks like on the auto loans? Dan Neumeyer :  I don't know that I \u2013 this is Dan. I don't know that we can quote specific numbers. It is one of the factors that we use in our customs score, but I don't think we have shared specifics regarding that kind of data. It is one of the main factors that we look at in extending credit. Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.: Okay. Has it been relatively constant over the last couple of years? Dan Neumeyer :  Yes, it has. Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.: Okay. Steve Steinour :  Our custom also overrides FICO. So, there are 780 FICOs we don't do because of that custom score, which would give you some indication of consumer leverage and us trying to stay on the conservative side of that, Bob. Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.: Okay. On the auto floor plan side, I was a little surprised you mentioned that utilization rates have been running lower given just the strength in auto sales. I'm curious what you think has been driving the utilization rates down in that book? Steve Steinour :  Just strong second quarters and inventory positioning. It's not a huge reduction for us. I think it's just an advance of the season. Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.: Okay. Alright. Thank you, guys. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Your line is open. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group :  Just curious, sorry to beat the dead horse on auto, but does the OCC report that recently highlighted risks in the auto industry as an area of concern? Does that make you rethink the concentration limit that you guys have had in place for a while? Dan Neumeyer :  This is Dan. Absolutely not. We've had consistent, strong performance. It's a core competency, and I think our performance in the long run speaks for itself. Our concentration limits were set quite sometime ago. We think they are at appropriate levels, both in terms of percentage of capital and the overall mix of the loan book. No, we're comfortable with it, have been, and will remain so. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group :  Thanks. On the Fair Play checking, we've seen competitors come out now with some type of free checking product, going after some small-dollar depositors. Any concern or risks on your side from competition and potentially seeing a slowdown in deposit gathering there? Steve Steinour :  No, not really. Our consumer relationships are up 8% year-over-year and 9% link-quarter annualized. We have a first-mover advantage. We have a very, very well recognized market-leading product with one-of-a-kind features with 24-hour grades. We think we've got plenty of running room going forward. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group :  Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company:  Steve, to your point on the last slide about the 3% and change revenue growth against 0.5% on expense growth, is that the type of magnitude of operating leverage that you think is sustainable as you look out through the rest of this year and next year? What does it mean for the efficiency ratio? Steve Steinour :  We haven't provided that specific guidance on that level of detail, Ken. I'm going to refrain from doing that, if you'll excuse me? We are very focused on operating leverage and our efficiency. We will continue to be. We're not backing off of our long-term goal, and we expect to make progress. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company:  Okay. The second question then, just \u2013 sorry to nitpick on the expenses, but in terms of just that explicit expense guide being flat ex one-time items, would you consider the $5 million consulting expense mentioned in the release on page 7 as a one-time item? I'm just getting \u2013 is it off of the $458.6 million or is it more off of a $453.6 million? Mac McCullough :  Ken, this is Mac. The one-time item that we mentioned around strategic planning expense, we will see some additional pickup in the third quarter around some investment that we've made in technology, depreciation, amortization, those types of things. We could see that filling in that gap as it relates to that one-time item coming out of the second quarter. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company:  Okay, so it's more just around the reported number? Because you guys didn't have an explicit item that you pointed out on page 2 like you had in the past? Mac McCullough :  That's exactly right. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company:  Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Terry McEvoy \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach:  Just your differentiated consumer and commercial products, do they have better success in more urban markets or in some of the smaller markets you operate in? The reason I ask as, if you look at the midwest, Chicago is about three times bigger than Columbus and you're not there. Clearly, it's defined as a midwest market and I'm trying to get a better understanding whether that over the mid to longer term would represent some growth opportunities, given the products and the success you've had over the last five years? Steve Steinour :  Terry, we've found success with this across the franchise. We don't see a noticeable difference between urban, suburban, or even rural. We're measuring our customer growth at the branch level, and it's fairly consistent over an extended period of time. Terry McEvoy \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach:  Okay. As a follow-up question, the rollout of the enhanced ATMs, is that just a necessity to compete with the larger banks? Or is there something there that differentiates you from your competitors and will allow you to grow market share because of the investments you're making at that level? Steve Steinour :  It has several benefits for us. One is it drives more efficiency through the system by having an imaged capability. As you know, we're completing, this quarter, a branch image-capture system, so our item processing will be very substantially reduced as a consequence. It also, importantly, put us in a position to make adjustments to how we process and handle cutoff times. We will be more of an industry leader around cutoff times as we move forward post implementation. Terry McEvoy \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach:  Great. Thanks, Steve. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Your line is open. Chris Mutascio \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I thought I would throw this out there to see if you would take the bait. The $5 million cost on the strategic planning, could you care to elaborate on what type of strategic planning that would incur? Steve Steinour :  The essence of our plan compiled in 2009, we've been talking about it consistently over the last four years. We felt when we initiated it, it would be roughly a five-year plan. We wanted to step back, challenge ourselves, get a third-party lens in to help us do some benchmarking, do some other things, which frankly have been very, very helpful to us, very constructive. We're in the midst of that process. The engagement has been completed. Thus, Mac was clear that the expenses were second quarter, and we have some things we'll work on that we'll talk about in the future. Chris Mutascio \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Is that something that we might hear from by end of the year heading into next year in terms of any type of new strategic focus? Steve Steinour :  It will be something we'll communicate, if not late this year, then early next year. I would view it as enhanced execution, for sure, and maybe a few newer thoughts, but certainly not revolutionary. Chris Mutascio \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dixon with DISCERN. Your line is open. Chip Dixon \u2013 DISCERN:  Question is really on the net interest margin and getting a sense of how long it's going to take in this environment before the interest rate environment stops being a headwind for you guys? In other words, just assuming the status quo and where you are, how long before all the repricing is done and balance sheet growth will equal net interest income growth? Mac McCullough :  Chip, it's Mac. I would say that if you take a look at the current rate environment and expectations in the marketplace, we're probably looking fourth quarter, first quarter in terms of starting to see some of that take place. It does depend on what's happening from a competition perspective, obviously. It's competitive on the C&I market space, and we're going to continue to see repricing, but we'll also see competitive pressures impacting that margin as well. Chip Dixon \u2013 DISCERN:  Okay. Thanks. Separately on the C&I business, why are people borrowing and how does it tell you the economy is changing? Steve Steinour :  We've invested a lot in our capabilities in small business, our middle market, and our specialty verticals, which are substantially focused on in-region activity. There's been a consistent growth throughout Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, our footprint markets. We've been able to, obviously, take some market share along the way. We invested early in 2010 in starting to expand these capabilities as others were pulling back, so just like auto where we invested in a contrarian fashion, we got in early. The businesses are doing well. Remember, we're in more of a manufacturing center of the country; manufacturing's doing well. There's more on-shoring than off-shoring. We have great other factors, like low-cost gas coming into play. So, the states themselves are very well run fiscally. Multiple years of billion dollar plus or minus surpluses translating into lower taxes, so very attractive, much more competitive than they were historically. I think we're in the early innings of that game. There are a lot of foundational elements in place here for us to continue to be able to see businesses grow and prosper. We will retain that focus and I think be a winner as the economies continue to grow in our footprint. Chip Dixon \u2013 DISCERN:  Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of John Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Just a follow up on that one, at least it's not an auto question on loan growth. The question for you, Steve, is are you more optimistic on the lending outlook today than you were a quarter ago? Are you more optimistic as you look to the second half and later in the year? Steve Steinour :  Yes. I'll expand on that a little bit, if you don't mind, John. As we said coming into the year, we thought second half would be better than first. It was certainly in 2013, and we saw it that way. We remain bullish. We've got robust pipelines as we come into the third quarter and a lot of good activity. We see a strengthening of confidence, generally, in the business community. We are, I think, poised to continue to grow beyond the current level. If we continue to execute well, then we should be in position to move forward with the economy as it improves. John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Okay. That's helpful. Then just one follow up on the deposit service charge line. I think we all know you had the $6 million headwind coming in Q3. Is there anything else you feel you need to alter in terms of your checking account products, or is this just about it and it's going to be about account growth going forward? Steve Steinour :  We've said before, we don't have anything else planned. There's an expectation that we will continue to be market leading in terms of consumer growth, and so I don't foresee anything that we have to do. There may be something we choose to do here or there, but I don't foresee anything that we have to do. John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  I actually had two quick follow ups. It's actually been quite a few quarters since you last did an auto securitization. If you were to do one here, what's your sense of the market and the rough gain on sale margin you would expect? Steve Steinour :  We think the market is strong, and the gain on sale has clearly come in. I don't know if it's an equivalent $1 billion securitization of a full-in paper as 50%, 60%, 70%, somewhere in that range of what it had been. That may continue to move around a little bit, hopefully strengthens. Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  Okay. That's helpful. Just one other one. Steve, following up on all the comments about increased confidence, can you specifically talk about what you're seeing from small business? Thanks. Steve Steinour :  There's much more small business activity this year than we saw through the first half of 2013. The economies, the town, cities, communities that we work in, are all doing better, and some of them have been doing well for a number of years. But if you think about the important market for us like Cleveland, you've had a couple of pretty significant shots in the arm in the last few weeks. That, if anything, just continues to bolster confidence. Again, the cities are doing better. There's a great downtown revitalization going on in Cincinnati. There's one under way in Cleveland. I'm very bullish about Detroit as it comes through this bankruptcy. We like our geography a lot. We believe we've got an important role. We're at the cross roads of a lot of the opportunities in these important geographies for further growth. I think we're well positioned in that regard. Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator :  There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Steinour. Steve Steinour :  In summary, we're very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, as our strategies and execution drove strong results. There's market acceptance of our value proposition, our best-in-class service, our convenience, and our Fair Play philosophy. You can see this as we continue to gain market share and share of wallet. We're seeing good customer activity and our local economies to recover and strengthen. It's demonstrated by our 9% average loan growth this quarter. We produced high percent revenue growth and 9% net income growth in a challenging environment. We recognized the interest rate environment and competitive pressures are not going to way overnight, so we have work yet to do to finish out the year as strongly as it's begun. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year through top-line revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Finally, our Board and our Management team, we're all long-term shareholders, so we're focused on driving long-term performance. I want to thank you for your interest in Huntington and your participation on the call today. Have a great day. Operator :  This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Let\u2019s get started. Steve? Steve Steinour :  Thank you for joining us today. Huntington had a solid third quarter with the underlying results showing continued disciplined execution. Investments we\u2019ve made over the last several years are paying off. This is demonstrated by top-line revenue growth, continued balance sheet growth and what we view as industry leading customer growth. This quarter, you also saw us take steps to optimize not only our organization, but the digital distribution. For the quarter, we reported net income of $155 million, a 13% decrease from the year-ago quarter and EPS of $0.18 per common share. This represented a 0.97 return on assets and a nearly 10% return on equity. It\u2019s worth noting that this quarter\u2019s results included two significant items that totaled $22.8 million of non-interest expense. Mac and I will provide more comments in a few minutes, but there are additional details on slides 22 and 23. Revenue increased 5% from the prior year. Net interest income increased $42 million or 10% year over year, while non-interest income decreased modestly. Net interest income year-over-year benefited from two items. Our investments in our auto and commercial segments drove a $4.1 billion, or 10% increase in loans and we added nearly $2.7 billion of incremental securities as we prepared for the upcoming Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio or LCR rules. The benefit of the larger balance sheet was partially offset by 14 basis-point decrease in net interest margin driven by tighter loan spreads and inability to materially re-price deposits lower and a larger securities portfolio, again as we prepared for the upcoming Basel III LCR rules. Third quarter non-interest expense increased $57 million over the same period in the prior year. I\u2019ll discuss the details of this quarter\u2019s actions in a few slides. And again there are additional details on slide 22, but $40 million of the increase relates to $23 million of significant items in this quarter and $70 million of significant items that were a net benefit in the year ago quarter. Compared to second quarter 2014, our adjusted expenses were stable at around $457 million. We continue to achieve positive operating leverage year-to-date and remain committed to positive operating leverage for the full year. I will cover OCR in more detail later in the presentation, but we continue to gain market share and share of wallet. While there remains more than we can due to increase product penetration, we believe our robust customer growth and OCR sales process are driving long-term shareholder value. Turning to slide seven, over the last year, our credit quality has improved. Net charge-offs in the quarter were 26 basis points, well below our long-term target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. While we continue to deploy capital to grow the balance sheet and distribute significant earnings to shareholders, our capital ratios remain strong. At the end of the third quarter our tangible common equity ratio was 8.35%, down 66 basis points from a year ago and 3 basis points from the last quarter. Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.31%, down 54 basis points from a year ago and 5 basis points from the prior quarter. Both of these reductions reflect the combination of our discipline, balance sheet growth and strong capital management through increased dividends and buybacks over the last year. We have repurchased over 32 million shares in the last year and this quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million common shares at an average cost of $9.70 per share. We have approximately 86 million of remaining share repurchase capacity through the end of the 2015 first quarter. Slide eight has a few additional first-quarter highlights. First, we completed the acquisition and integration of 24 branches in Michigan; second, we continue to optimize our distribution network to better serve our customer needs today while investing to stay ahead of trends for tomorrow. By the end of the year, we will be consolidating 26 branches including consolidating a few traditional branches into in-store branches. Throughout 2015 we will nearly complete our previously announced in-store build out with approximately 50 new branches again in 2015. During this quarter we completed two significant technology investments; the installation of a new teller platform across the entire franchise and the completion of the year and half long effort to image-enable our ATM network. These investments are critical as we look to not only improve the customer experience, but also drive efficiencies in our processes. Deposits to the branches and ATMs are now digitally imaged and processed. For example, we\u2019ve already seen 25% of our deposit shift from the teller line to our new ATMs. And another 5% have migrated to the mobile channel with the introduction of our Mobile Photo Deposit capture launched earlier this year. Next I\u2019m proud to report that this measure by number of loans, Huntington is the number one SBA lender in the country. And we achieved this distinction despite only making SBA loans in our footprint through our remarkable colleagues who made a small business lending core competency for Huntington, as well as the efforts of our continuous improvement team, who have improved the overall experience for our customers and our colleagues. Finally, consistent with our capital plan and given our continued strength in earnings and capital, our Board recently approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.06 a share payable to shareholders of record December 19th. And with that let me turn it over to Mac for a more detailed review of the numbers. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Slide 9 is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. Steve already touched on several of these, so let\u2019s move on to slide 10 and drill into the details. Relative to last year\u2019s third quarter, revenue increased $36 million or 5% to $714 million. Spread revenues accounted for the entire increase as net interest income increased 10%. Driving net interest income growth was a $7 billion or 15% increase in earning assets. Loans made up more than $4 billion of the increase with the remainder of the growth in the securities portfolio including $1.2 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments originated by our commercial lending teams. The remainder of the growth in the securities book was driven by our preparation for the upcoming Basel III liquidity coverage ratio requirements. The net interest margin compressed 14 basis points year-over-year to 3.20%. Earning asset yields compressed 20 basis points year-over-year, including 4 basis points of compression due to the larger investment securities portfolio. Funding costs improved by 9 basis points. The net interest margin compressed 8 basis points linked quarter, but let me remind you that last quarter\u2019s NIM had a 4 basis point benefit due to an interest recovery on an acquired commercial real estate loan. Third quarter fee income was $247 million, which represented a $6 million decline or 3% from the year ago quarter. Several small items drove the decline as customer activity in the quarter was slightly below the same quarter of last year and the second quarter of 2014. As Steve mentioned earlier, there are two expense-related significant items impacting the quarter. You may want to refer to table two in the press release or page 22 of the presentation as I walk through these items. First, as we disclosed in our second quarter 10-Q as a subsequent event on July 30th of this year, Huntington commenced organizational actions to reduce non-interest expense and improved productivity. These actions, consistent of a reduction in force and the decommissioning of certain real estate assets, these actions are substantially complete. We are also announcing today that we are closing 26 branches by the end of 2014 as we continue to optimize our distribution network to better accommodate the changing preferences and behaviors of our customers. We incurred $19.3 million in the quarter for these significant items. Second, on September 16th of this year, we announced the acquisition of 24 branches in Michigan from Bank of America. As Steve mentioned earlier, the deal is closed and the branches are fully integrated. Net of a small benefit from the Camco acquisition that closed earlier this year, we incurred $3.5 million in the quarter for these acquisition-related significant items. Reported non-interest expense in the third quarter was $480 million, an increase of $57 million or 13% from a year ago quarter. However, after adjusting for the significant items I just walked you through, expense increased $70 million or 4%. Compared to the second quarter and also adjusting for significant items, adjusted expenses were down $1 million. Looking forward to 2015, we expect non-interest expense to grow modestly somewhere in the range of 2% to 4% higher than 2014 after adjusting for significant items as we continue to make investments in the franchise, as evidenced by the acceleration of our previously announced in-store initiative that Steve mentioned earlier. But importantly, we are once again committing to delivering positive operating leverage for full year 2015. While we are still finalizing our 2015 budget, it is worth noting that this commitment to positive operating leverage in 2015 is based on a scenario where the Fed does not raise rates in 2015. Slide 11 displays the trends in our earning asset mix, net interest income and net interest margin. As I mentioned earlier, average loans increased $4.1 billion or 10% year-over-year. Commercial and auto remained the primary drivers of loan growth, although we experienced growth in every portfolio. Average commercial and industrial loans grew 9% year-over-year. More than half of the increase occurred in our specialty lending verticals, all of which continue to mature and gain traction. Business banking and our auto dealer floor plan lending were other key contributors to growth. The auto loan portfolio grew $1.9 billion or 32% from the year ago quarter as originations remain strong and we continue to portfolio all of our production. As you can see on the auto loan slide in the presentation appendix, we did not sacrifice credit quality to drive this volume. And it is worth noting that after a multi-year decline in net new yields, we pushed pricing increases through during the quarter with new money yields back over 3%. With respect to our auto finance business, I want to remind you that the summer months are seasonally strong. On the other hand, the auto floor plan lending side of the business is weak in the fall as dealers liquidate the prior year\u2019s models to make room for the new model year. Overall, utilization rate declined slightly and our auto floor plan loan utilization rates continue to run a couple percentage points lower than we would normally expect, as a result of very strong auto sales for the last two quarters. The chart on the right side of slide 11 shows the net interest margin trend which we have previously discussed. Turning to slide 12; the right side of this slide shows our deposit mix, while the left side illustrates maturity schedule of our CD book. Average core deposits increased $2.3 billion or 5% year-over-year. While not a meaningful impact to this average growth, the September acquisition of the 24 Bank of America branches in Michigan increased end of period deposits by approximately $700 million. For the last several years, we have focused on increasing low cost core deposits while reducing our dependence on a higher cost CDs. Average demand deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 6% year-over-year, while average money market deposits increased to $2.2 billion or 14%. Growth in these categories more than offset the intentional $1 billion or 24% decrease in average core certificates of deposit. There continues to be an opportunity to drive an improvement in the mix, but as you can see over the next four quarters, we have approximately $2.3 billion of CDs maturing with a weighted average rate of 51 basis points. Another important piece of the funding mix dynamic that you do not see on this slide is the $4.1 billion year-over-year increase in short and long-term borrowings, $2.5 billion of which was bank and holding company debt issued over the past year. We didn\u2019t issue any long-term debt this quarter but as we continue to focus on remixing our deposit base and managing our overall cost of funds, we expect to be active in the debt markets. Slide 13 shows the trends in capital. We remain well capitalized with all of our regulatory capital ratios showing improvement from the second quarter of 2014. We remain an active purchaser of our stock and at the end of the quarter had approximately 86 million of remaining share repurchase capacity through the end of the first quarter of 2015 under our 250 million repurchase authorization. Slide 14 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs fell noticeably from the year ago quarter to 26 basis points, as both consumer and commercial charge-offs experienced a meaningful decline. In particular, home equity and commercial real estate experienced the largest declines. Loans past due greater than 90 days remained very well controlled at 30 basis points. Nonaccruals were down slightly in the quarter, while the criticized asset ratio continues to show modest improvement. Slide 15 shows the trends in our non-performing assets. The chart on the left demonstrates continued improvement, albeit at a reduced rate. The chart on the right shows the non-performing asset inflows which were also fairly stable with the prior quarter. Reviewing slide 16, the loan loss provision of $24.5 million was up from a year-ago quarter due to the implementation of enhancements to our reserve calculation for our commercial portfolios in the third quarter of 2013. The allowance-to-loan ratio fell very modestly to 1.47%, down from 1.72% from the prior year and from 1.50% in the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance to non-accrual loans was in line with the last several quarters at 211%. The level of the allowance is adequate and appropriate and reflects the stable credit trends discussed earlier along with increasing loan volume. Let me now turn the presentation back over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mac. Our fair play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR continues to drive new customer growth and improve product penetration. This slide illustrates the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households. Over the last year, consumer checking account households grew by 140,000 households or 11%. Now the third quarter\u2019s 18% linked quarter annualized growth rate includes 38,000 customers we acquired as part of the Bank of America transaction. Our strategy is not just about market share gains, but also gains in share of wallet. We continue to focus on increasing the number of products and services we provide to those customers knowing that this will translate into revenue growth. Our OCR cross-sell goal of six or more products and services improved to almost 49% this quarter, up more than 150 basis points from a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue is up over 9% year-over-year. We work to the impact of the changes we\u2019ve made in our business banking checking products that impacted a number of lower balance accounts. Revenue grew just under 10% over the last year as the accounts that were closed had little impact on revenue, but did impact the optics of our commercial relationship portfolio. That\u2019s on slide 18, turning to slide 19, and expectations for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect loan growth predominantly in auto and commercial lending, but as we discussed before, competition remains intense and that has lowered our pull-through rates. We are closely monitoring our NIM and remain focused on pricing discipline. Within auto, we are continuing to monitor the securitization markets and we\u2019ll look to use it as a tool to manage our overall concentration. It\u2019s unlikely we will be in the market during the fourth quarter, but we do expect two securitizations in 2015. We will continue to reinvest cash flows from investment securities into LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets. In addition, securities are likely to continue to modestly increase as we buy additional level one high quality liquid assets and a portion of the commercial team\u2019s production is placed in the securities portfolio. The NIM is expected to remain under pressure, but we expect net interest income to grow as earning asset growth more than offsets the NIM compression. Non-interest income, excluding the net MSR impact is expected to remain near the third quarter\u2019s level. We also expect adjusted non-interest expense; excluding significant items will remain near the current quarter\u2019s adjusted level. Fourth quarter 2014 is expected to include approximately $10 million of significant items related to the already announced franchise repositioning activities. We will continue to look for ways to reduce expenses, while not impacting our previously announced growth strategies or our high level of customer service. On the credit front, we see credit trends are beginning to reach normal levels. We expect net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. Provision was below our long-term expectation during this past quarter. Both are expected to continue to experience modest changes, given their absolute low levels. Turning to slide 20, as you can see, we continue to be on track for delivering positive operating leverage for 2014. We\u2019re committed to positive operating leverage for the full year and are committing to delivering positive operating leverage in 2015. We still have a lot of work to do over the final quarter, but I\u2019m pleased with our year-to-date progress. Finally, I\u2019d like to congratulate two of our senior leaders Mary Navarro, for being recognized as one of the American Banker\u2019s 25 Most Powerful Women in banking; and Helga Houston for being recognized as one of American Banker\u2019s 25 Women to Watch in Banking. We\u2019re very proud that they\u2019re part of our team. And so with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Todd. Todd Beekman : Sally, we\u2019ll now take questions. And we ask the courtesy of your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill and Partners. Your line is open. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Good morning guys. Todd Beekman : Good morning, Scott. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Steve, I was hoping you could expand a little on some of the comments you made about the competitive dynamic on the commercial side, I guess mostly within the context of few of the larger Ohio based banks have one, if I think probably more of a slowdown in the commercial side than you did and then two, kind of it\u2019s sort of a more direct pullback. Just hoping to get a little additional color beyond what you made in your prep remarks at where are you guys on spectrum, how you think about things as you look forward? Steve Steinour : Well, as we indicated, we have slightly lower line of credit utilizations. We\u2019ve got lower levels of pull through and that\u2019s reflecting competitive dynamics. Half of our commercial growth has occurred in our specialty verticals, Scott. So, we made investments over the last several years in trying to position these businesses for growth and they\u2019re largely on track, and those niches with dedicated personnel and industry knowledge have paid dividends to-date and I think will continue to help us with our growth as we go forward. I would say generally the economies in our region, our footprint are doing well. And that\u2019s also fueling us a bit. Finally, we do a lot of small business lending. And so, there is a component that might be thought of a sort of a small business, a business banking context that\u2019s also driving that growth. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Okay, perfect. I appreciate that color and then either Steve or Mac I was hoping you could touch on the cost side for just a moment. First, were any of the savings from the July initiative, did they hit the third quarter or will that all be in the fourth quarter? And then Mac, you had alluded to I think 2% to 4% core expense growth next year. I know you guys have been in the process of kind of a broader strategic review. Does that embed the results or conclusions of that review or is that still kind of ongoing appending? Steve Steinour : Thanks Scott. So there was, I would say a slight benefit on adjusted basis in the third quarter relative to the reduction in force that we had. We will see that come through in the fourth quarter, but also keep in mind that we\u2019re adding the Bank of America branches and we are accelerating the investment in-store. So these affected those things in as well. And obviously all those things are played in with the guidance that we\u2019ve given around fourth quarter being flat for third quarter on an adjusted basis with non-interest expense and that 2% to 4% range of growth off an adjusted 2014 base in 2015, which does include all the strategic actions that we need to take in 2015 related to the process that we just came through. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Okay. Alright, perfect. Thank you very much. Steve Steinour : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is open. Bob Ramsey - FBR: Hi, good morning guys. I just want to talk a little bit about auto. I know you all said on your prepared remarks that you are looking to do a couple of securitizations next year after you guys sort of stepped out of that market for a couple of years. Is that a reflection of loan concentration one, or is it a question of sort of where you see the market today or what\u2019s sort of driving that shift? Steve Steinour : Bob, we said we had a concentration limit on auto a year or so ago and what we\u2019re going to be running into that next year and so there is certainly a concentration component into the securitization. But as we\u2019ve done in the past, if we see better execution, we have securitized in the past when we had room into the limited. And next year, we\u2019ll start with the concentration. But if we find an opportunity that gives us better economics in the future, we\u2019ll use that as well. We originate to all; it\u2019s the same quality portfolio that we\u2019ve securitized as what we hold. It\u2019s performed very well for us; the securities had actually outperformed expectations. And we\u2019re confident in the quality of what we\u2019re doing and you get to see that every quarter as we give you the credit and other metrics on our production. Bob Ramsey - FBR: And could you remind me what that concentration limit is when you guys are sort of targeting on the portfolio? Steve Steinour : We haven\u2019t given an exact number, but we\u2019ve expressed it as a percentage of capital in the past and I believe we\u2019ve reduced about 150% and that was capital a couple of years ago. So, you think about round numbers, $7.5 billion, $8 billion that should put you in the ballpark. Bob Ramsey - FBR: Great. That\u2019s helpful. There has been a lot of talk in the media as well about the growing proportion of auto originations that are subprime, I\u2019m curious if you could tell me what percent of auto production this quarter was subprime and maybe how if at all that has changed over the last year or two? Dan Neumeyer : We basically -- this is Dan. And we really don\u2019t originate subprime. We\u2019ve been a super-prime and prime type lender and that\u2019s what we -- that\u2019s what\u2019s worked for us and that\u2019s what we continue to concentrate. Bob Ramsey - FBR: Great. Thank you, guys. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : I just wanted to ask on the margin outlook that you had mentioned on slide 19. As we think about the margin trajectory into next year under your rate scenario where the Fed doesn\u2019t raise the short end, could you help us think about what sort of the proportion of your margin impact is attributed to HQI buying and being LCR compliant versus core compression? I mean is that another way if not for LCR would we be closer to the bottom on the NIM at this point? Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks Erika. So the way to think about it in the current quarter if you look at it relatively third quarter of last year we had 20 basis points of compression on the asset side about four of that was related to LCR activities. And you might remember on the last call we talked about our outlook for the net interest margin. And we probably bottom fourth quarter of \u201814, first quarter of \u201815 based on a rate environment where we actually thought that we were going to see an increase from the Fed much sooner than we\u2019re planning right now. So with our current guidance and the way we\u2019re looking at our plan for 2015 with no Fed increase plan for 2015 at least from our perspective, we\u2019re going to continue to see margin pressure. I would say that\u2019s going to decelerate on a quarterly basis in 2015 and we are going to continue to add securities, primarily Ginnie Mae as it relates to what is required from an LCR perspective as we move towards that date of January \u201816. So I do think that the proportion that you\u2019re seeing related to the LCR impact is going to become larger as we move into 2015, I am not quite sure exactly what that\u2019s going to be. But we are seeing, I would say some of the spread compressions I guess back off a bit as we move through the portfolio of mix change. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Got it. And my second question is given that you\u2019ve pushed through a new money rate of 3% for your new auto originations, as you look out in terms of the competition for the credit spectrum that you do participate in, how much do you expect this to impact forward growth if at all into next year? Steve Steinour : I don\u2019t think it will really impact growth. We certainly didn\u2019t see that in the quarter when we pushed the rate increase through, actually had record origination volumes. So, I don\u2019t think that would be an impact. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Got it, great. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : Great, thanks. I guess first question I had was just in terms of the BOA branch deal, should we view this as kind of a one-off opportunistic opportunity to expand your footprint or when you think about the growth strategy over time, are there additional footprints or markets that you actually want to continue to build scale, we could see potentially more of these deals? Steve Steinour : Well this was in footprint, so it is part of our strategy to try and get more share where we are and build out, Ken. And we\u2019re going to continue to prioritize in our shared in the markets we\u2019re in. We might look at adjacent geography but the priority would be in footprint. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : Got it. Okay. And then just the other question I has in terms of LCR, can you just give us an update where do you stand on that? Other banks have provided percentages in terms of how, I guess where they stand on LCR. Thanks. Mac McCullough : Ken, it\u2019s Mac. So we\u2019re probably in the neighborhood of 80% of where we need to be. We\u2019re going to continue to add to the portfolio. We see the ability to take basically liquidity from the existing portfolio about a $100 million a month and get the right type of securities for LCR. So there will be a bit of a mix change in the existing portfolio and I would expect another 750 million to 1 billion incremental coming on as we move through 2015 to get us ready for January of 2016. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : Got you. And the new securities you\u2019re putting, does that have a meaningful impact on your NIM? Mac McCullough : We\u2019re primarily looking to bring [Jenny\u2019s] on. And it\u2019s hard to quote exactly where we are based on the market the last couple of days. But it does have an impact on the NIM; there is no doubt about it. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it material. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : Alright, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan: Hi, good morning everyone. Steve Steinour : Good morning. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan: So, the one-time cost for the July repositioning in closing 26 branches looks like around $30 million, how much do you expect to see per year from those actions? Mac McCullough : So the expectation was $30 million to $35 million on an annual basis. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan: Okay, perfect. And then if I look at the 2% to 4% range you\u2019re talking about for expense growth next year, at least the upper end of the range seems high, particularly given the number you just gave on cost saves. What are some of the tailwinds pushing expense growth in 2015 and how much control do you have within that range? Mac McCullough : So we have made significant investments in technology, if you take a look back over the last couple of years, Steve mentioned a few of those on the call today with the new teleplatform. We\u2019re now completely image enabled in all of our branches. We start to get the paper out of the branches. So clearly savings related to that. We\u2019re completely image enabled on ATMs now and we also mentioned that we\u2019re seeing customer behavior change with the migration of deposits to the image enabled ATMs as well as the photo mobile deposit capture, which is another investment we\u2019ve been making around digital. We have made large investments in in-stores which we highly value. We\u2019re saying our customers migrate transactions into the in-stores. We think it\u2019s a very important part of our distribution strategy going forward as we think about optimizing distribution and really getting the right cost and the right investment and distribution going forward. So those are some investments that we\u2019ve made that will have amortization expense from a technology perspective in 2015 or additional run rate expense related to bringing the new branches online. So, we do think these investments are important relative to the direction that we\u2019re taking to franchise in the future and those are some of the items that we\u2019ll see in 2015 and why the 2% to 4% range is what we expect. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I could just ask one more, some banks that have small auto portfolios pointed that particularly in direct auto is getting floppy, right, these are core part of your business. In that prime part of the business, are you seeing any floppiness there and you guys, I know you had very strong growth this quarter. But what do you do in terms of tightening, what are you just seeing in the market overall? Thank you. Dan Neumeyer : Yes, this is Dan. I think I don\u2019t know if there isn\u2019t segment of market but it is very competitive although different lenders have their different initiatives that they are interested in. And as I mentioned we\u2019re in that kind of prime, super prime, there is some competition, but given the fact that we were able to put through the price increase and still maintain volumes I think that gives an indication that it\u2019s still somewhat rational. So we are pleased with the segment of the market we\u2019re competing in. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks for the color. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Thanks. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Just following on auto and credit, obviously your staff is Mac as you alluded to the FICOs are the highest they\u2019ve been in the long time and the LTVs haven\u2019t changed. But we\u2019ve seen a bit of a rollover in the Mannheim, your delinquencies have been up for the last two quarters. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about just protecting the book from a future credit perspective and what underlying trends are you seeing just kind of inside the portfolio and any signals that were about to go the wrong way on just auto credit regardless of how good of a job you guys do, but just from a book perspective? Dan Neumeyer : Sure. This is Dan. So we do watch indexes like the Mannheim that\u2019s one of our leading indicators. I can see that we are seeing anything right now that gives us pause, but again, we stayed very much to our strategy of very strong FICOs reasonable loan to values and terms et cetera. So no real early warning indicators even as we have expanded into a new market we take a very cautious approach, we take a bit more conservative stance when entering into those new markets and those seasons and then go to our more traditional parameters. So we watch very closely, but no early indications of any real problems. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Dan, thank you. And then secondly, Mac when you talk about reentering securitization markets and potentially doing two next year, it seems like the spreads are gain on sale potential was a lot tighter in the auto market than it was when you were doing them a few years ago. Could you help us understand how you think about what a gain on sales might look like now versus then and also what the trade-off would be in terms of seeking that gain on sale one-time through the fee side and then give up versus the give up in NII? Mac McCullough : Yes. So we have been monitoring the securitization markets very closely and you are correct. The gains are much lower than they were last time we went this direction. I would roughly say that probably 50% is something in that range. And clearly there probably is a bit of a give up by securitizing and not keeping the production on balance sheet, but we think this is the right thing to do from a concentration limit perspective and if the direction that we have actually built for 2015 plan. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: That\u2019s all embedded -- those trade-offs taken to securitization and trade-offs to the NII that\u2019s built into the plan for \u201815? Mac McCullough : That\u2019s correct. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay, got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Delmoro - Deutsche Bank : Good morning guys. You have Dan Delmoro calling in for Matt. Could you just give us some color on what drove that $8 million net credit recovery in CRE this quarter and just for general outlook for recoveries going forward? Mac McCullough : Sure. We\u2019ve seen strong recoveries in the CRE book; obviously we had significant charge-off activity several years back so we\u2019re starting to see a benefit of that. I do think it is probably the recoveries probably aren\u2019t going to grow from here. We\u2019ll continue to see reasonable level of recoveries going forward. But that\u2019s all multiple credits, Dan. Dan Delmoro - Deutsche Bank : Got it. And separately, again loan sales was up this quarter to about $8 million after seeing outlined around $4 million in the last few quarters. Should we expect that to continue or to get back down to the more normalized level? Steve Steinour : Yes, I would think about it back at the normalized level, those were primarily [FPA] gains and I think we just had some unusual gains in the quarter. Dan Delmoro - Deutsche Bank : Alright. Thank you very much. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve Steinour : Hi Jon. Mac McCullough : Hi Jon. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Just a follow-up on the branches, can you just talk a little more about the decision to accelerate be in-store expansion? I\u2019m guessing, this is just filling out Eagle and Meijer sooner rather than later. And then maybe an update on the impact to the entire effort, as you touched a little bit on it in the press release, but maybe an idea of how the entire effort is tracking in terms of current year and maybe next year\u2019s P&L? Mac McCullough : So we committed to a statewide exclusive arrangement with Giant Eagle and Meijer; several other banks with different store locations. And as they, and these generally were the most attractive store, as those leases expire or there is opportunity for early exits, we\u2019ve been very interested and backfilling this as soon as possible. And we\u2019re going to benefit from that in 2015 to the extent of 50 openings. That will largely complete the program; there will be a few more in out years, but the vast majority of that will be complete. The in-stores themselves as Mac alluded are seeing a much higher level of customer choice than we expected. So the transactional side of that in addition to the sales side is going very, very well. And that convenience play we think is part of what\u2019s driving it. We\u2019ve factored the 50 expansions into the 2015 budget and so that\u2019s in that expense guidance of 2% to 4% Mac gave you. And I mentioned earlier that we have 50 that have turned profitable and we expect the existing 120 plus to be profitable around the end of the year. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. End of the year meaning end of \u201815? Steve Steinour : No, end of \u201814; existing 120 plus will be profitable around the end of \u201814. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks a lot. Steve Steinour : Okay. So, it\u2019s roughly two, two and half year average to get them to profitability, Jon. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Hello there, I just wanted to touch on the two slide tweaks to the outlook, first, no longer expecting securitization in the fourth quarter; and then second, the non-performing assets, you\u2019ve taken out the language around those decline and just wonder if you could discuss the thinking? Steve Steinour : Could you repeat the first half of that question please? We had difficulty in hearing, Geoff. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Sure. So, the not securitizing in the fourth quarter, before it seemed like there was more of a possibility, now given the outlook it sounds less likely. And then the commentary around non-performing assets declining seems to have been dropped. So what was the rationale for making those two changes? Mac McCullough : So, this is Mac. Regarding the securitizations, as I mentioned earlier, we have been monitoring our markets very carefully. And just given some of the volatility and some of the rate issues that we\u2019ve seen, we don\u2019t need to do the securitization in 2014. So, we\u2019ve taken the guidance out related to that for specific reasons around just market conditions and making sure that we get the accounting for this right. So, 2015 looks much more probable at this point. Steve Steinour : Yes. And with regard to the NPA, the only real thought there is we\u2019ve reached the level of our NPAs that are within our normalized range. We do expect to see some level of continued improvement going forward, but as you see this quarter, we\u2019re down to levels where a couple of deals can make a difference in the level of NPAs, so from quarter-to-quarter you might see some modest volatility. But we do still expect over the next couple of years to see some level of continued improvement there. So, not a big shift in how we\u2019re thinking about it. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Okay. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from KBW. Your line is open. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Good morning Steve and Mac. How are you? Steve Steinour : Great, thank you. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Good. Hey, Mac, I just want to go over the expense again, just want to make sure I understand how this plays out. If I look at your adjusted expenses in 2013, it looks like about $1.78 billion and given the guidance for -- what you\u2019ve done already in \u201814 and the guidance for the fourth quarter, it looks like it would be about $1.81 billion in 2014, so about 2% increase in \u201814 over \u201813. And your guidance for next year is expenses up 2% to 4%. Now I do realize there is acquisitions involved that will be the full run rate in \u201815 that can pressure the expense rate, but it is higher than what it was in \u201814 or projected to be higher in \u201814. So am I to assume that the cost save initiatives that you take in place are essentially be fully invested in the franchise rather than hitting the bottom line at least in the first year in 2015? Mac McCullough : Yes Chris, I think when you go through the math that would be the way to take a look at it. I think with the investments that we\u2019re making in the in-stores and I think the Bank of America acquisition and how that plays into 2015 on a full year basis along with some of the technology investments that I mentioned earlier, those things would basically be 2% to 4% increase that we\u2019ve talked about and that would offset the adjustments that we\u2019ve made in the fourth quarter. Chris Mutascio - KBW:  Okay. Thanks Mac. I appreciate it. Mac McCullough : Thanks Chris. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steinour, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Steve Steinour :  Great, thank you. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the third quarter, as our strategies and disciplined execution drove strong results. There is a market acceptance of our value proposition. It is clearly an acceptance. Our best-in-class service, our convenience and our fair play philosophy. And you can see this as we continue to gain market share and share of wallet. And you can continue to see distinct examples of how we are optimizing the franchise. We produced 5% percent revenue growth in a challenging environment and are highly focused on pricing discipline as we continue to grow our portfolio. We recognize that the interest rate environment and competitive pressures are not going to go away overnight, so we have work yet to do to finish out the year as strongly as it began. Finally, our Board and this management team are all long-term shareholders; we are very focused on reducing volatility and driving long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington. Have a good day everybody. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Todd Beekman, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Todd Beekman : Thank you, Anastasia and welcome. I\u2019m Todd Beekman the Managing Director of Strategy and Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides that we will be reviewing can be found on our website at huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about an hour after the close of the call. Slides two and three have several aspects, basis of today\u2019s presentation. I encourage you to read these, but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. And in that regard, I direct you to comparable GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, initial earnings-related material we released this morning and related 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website. Turning to slide four, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements.

As noted on slide five, presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer will also participate in Q&A portion of the call. Let\u2019s get started by turning to slide six. Steve? Steve Steinour : Thanks Todd. I\u2019d like to thank everyone on the call for joining us today. At Huntington, we enjoy a unique and advantaged position in the industry and we believe our future is bright. We\u2019re focused on executing our strategic plan and we\u2019re very pleased with results we are achieving. For the past several years, we\u2019ve invested in the company at a time when most of the industry\u2019s been pulling back. We\u2019ve expanded and optimized our distribution, both physical and digital. We\u2019ve invested in small business and commercial specialty lending verticals. We\u2019ve added new products such as our consumer and commercial credit cards and our new business in consumer checking accounts. And each represents just a handful of the investments we\u2019ve made. Our 2014 earnings reflected results from these investments, yet significant opportunity remains as none of these investments are mature. We have a strong outlook for the future. Slides six and seven show some of the financial highlights of the full year and the fourth quarter. Mac will go through more of the detail shortly, but I wanted to highlight a few of these items that I believe distinguish Huntington and illustrate our strategic execution. Huntington had a solid year in 2014, reporting net income of $632 million or $0.72 per common share while absorbing $0.06 per share of significant items. Return on assets for the year was 1.01% and the return on common tangible equity was 11.8%. Underlying fundamental trends were somewhat obscured by a net $75 million of significant items over the two years specifically. In 2014, results were negatively impacted by a net $65 million of significant items, while 2013 results benefited from a net $10 million of significant items. So, these significant items were largely related to two acquisitions and other strategic decisions that we believe would better position franchise for improved efficiency and profitability going forward. There are additional details regarding significant items on slides 22 and 23. For the full year, we reported a $3.6 billion or 9% in average loans and leases. Revenues increased to $100 million or 4% in 2014. Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage for the second year in a row, a commitment we have renewed for 2015 and in fact installed in our updated long term financial goals. We continue to post industry leading customer acquisition rates with 10% growth in consumer checking households and 3% growth in commercial relationships over the past year. Now, with respect to the commercial growth rate, like to remind you that early in 2014, we implemented some changes to our business banking products which caused approximately 10,000 lower balance accounts to be closed over the course of the year. So, the underlying core fundamentals were actually much stronger. We also continued to sell deeper across both our consumer and commercial relationships. So, almost half of our consumer relationships now have six or more products and services from Huntington while 42% of the commercial relationships have a cross-sell of 4% or higher. Fourth quarter net income of $164 million represented a 3% year-over-year increase while EPS of $0.19 was a penny higher than the year ago quarter. Return on assets for the fourth quarter 1% and return on tangible common equity was 11.9%. The 2014 fourth quarter included $20 million of significant items while the year ago quarter included $7 million of significant items. Total revenues for the fourth quarter increased $25 million or 4% from the year ago quarter, despite a $10 million headwind in mortgage banking income. A 10% increase in net interest income drove the overall revenue growth as a 13% increase in average earning assets more than offset continued pressure on the net interest margin. Our NIM decreased 10 basis points year-over-year but only 2 basis points from the third quarter. We remain focused on minimizing this net interest margin compression to disciplined pricing of loans in the face of increasing competition for quality loans in our markets and through continued improvement in our funding mix via our focus on core checking account, relationship growth and balance growth. While there is limited opportunity remaining in terms of the positive pricing levers, we still have significant opportunity remaining to increase non-interest bearing deposits and further improve our funding mix. The increase in our securities portfolio related to compliance with the Basel III liquidity coverage rules -- ratio rules has also negatively impacted our margin. And we expect additional further pressure as we continue to add approximately $1 billion incremental assets to the portfolio in 2015. We continue to enjoy improvements in our credit quality. We stated last quarter that we expect credit metrics will begin to stabilize given where we are in the credit cycle but this quarter exhibited particularly strong credit performance. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter were 20 basis points, bringing net charge-offs for the full year to 27 basis points, both well below our long-term target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. This quarter\u2019s net charge-offs benefited from some large recoveries within our C&I book as well as net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio. I should add, for the fifth consecutive quarter. Capital rations remained strong. We continue to be good stewards of shareholder capital via disciplined balance sheet growth and capital return. At the end of the year, tangible common equity ratio was 8.17%, down 65 basis points from a year ago and 18 basis points from the last quarter. Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.23%, down 67 basis points year-over-year and 8 basis points sequentially. Despite these declines, tangible book value per share increased 6% year-over-year to $6.62 due to our share repurchase program. For the full year, we repurchased almost 36 million shares at an average cost of $9.37 per share. During 2014, we returned approximately 84% of earnings to common shareholders to the combination of dividend and buyback. Just to repeat, approximately 84% of earnings to common shareholders to the combination of dividend and buyback. During the fourth quarter, our cash dividend increased to 20% and we repurchased 3.6 million shares. We have approximately $52 million of remaining share repurchase capacity through the end of the 2015 first quarter and we intend to complete this authorization. Slide eight has a few additional highlights for the fourth quarter. First, as we continue optimize distribution to better reflect changes in customer behavior, we completed the consolidation of 26 branches at year end. We introduced our new Huntington 5 and Huntington 25 checking account products, as we continue to improve customer choice and value related to our industry leading checking account products. Once again Huntington was recognized for our superior customer service, this time honored as the highest ranking in customer satisfaction with small business banking in the Midwest region by J.D. Power. And finally, in December, we disclosed our new long-term through the cycle financial goals. You will not see what we consider material changes from our prior goals but rather refine them as we reexamine the franchise and banking environment. We have replaced our former ROA target with the goal of return on tangible common equity in order to bring focus on this measure of profitability while closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders. There is a slight increase in our efficiency ratio from the prior mid-50s level which is an acknowledgement of the higher inherent cost of today\u2019s banking industry from increased regulatory burdens. Last, you will see that a new goal is positive operating leverage annually. We\u2019re committed to and delivered positive operating leverage in each of the past two years; we\u2019re committed to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2015. And this new goal formerly recognized as this is an integral for the company going forward. So, with that let me turn it over to Mac for a more detailed review of the numbers. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Slide nine is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. Steve already touched on several of these, so let\u2019s move on to slide 10 and drill into the underlying details. Relative to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, total revenue increased $25 million or 4% to $714 million. Spread revenue accounted for the entire increase as net interest income grew 10%. Driving net interest income growth was a $7 billion or 13% increase in average earning assets. Loans made up $4 billion of the increase with the remainder of the growth in the securities portfolio including $1.3 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments originated by our commercial lending teams. The net interest margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 3.18% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease reflected a 17 basis-point contraction in earning asset yields including 4 basis points related to the increase in the size of the securities portfolio as we prepare for the upcoming Basel III liquidity coverage ratio requirement and a 3 basis-point decline in the benefit from the non-interest bearing funds. These reductions were partially offset by 10 basis points of improvement in funding costs. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin compressed 2 basis points exclusively related to declining earning asset yields. Fourth quarter fee income of $233 million which represented a $17 million or 7% decline from the year ago quarter. Lower mortgage banking income accounted for $10 million of the decline while the remainder of the decrease primarily related to lower fees associated with commercial customer activity in the other income line. Negative impacts to fee income during the fourth quarter included $6 million of net MSR hedging related activity and a full quarter\u2019s impact of July\u2019s changes to our consumer deposit accounts which were previously estimated as $5 million per quarter. On a positive note, we continue to see the benefits of consumer and commercial customer growth with both electronic banking and capital markets revenue increasing more than 10% year-over-year. Reported non-interest expense in the fourth quarter was $483 million, an increase of $37 million or 8% from a year ago quarter. The current quarter included two significant items impacting non-interest expense. You might want to refer to table two in the press release or page 22 of the presentation as I walk through these items. First, we incurred $9 million of franchise repositioning expense related to the consolidation of 26 branches at year-end and other organizational actions announced last year; second, we had a $12 million addition to the litigation reserve. After adjusting for significant items, non-interest expense increased $24 million or 5% from a year ago quarter. Of this increase, $4 million related to the incremental impacts from the Camco acquisition and the Bank of America branch transaction. Other contributing factors included an increase in healthcare cost, higher professional service expense and higher equipment expense related to technology investments. Table eight and nine in the press release provide more detail related to non-interest expense. Compared to the third quarter and also adjusting for significant items in both quarters, adjusted expenses increased $5 million. The primary drivers of the linked quarter increase were higher healthcare cost and professional services expense. Slide 11 displays the trends in our earning asset mix, net interest income and net interest margin. As I mentioned earlier, average loans increased $4 billion or 9% year-over-year. The indirect auto and commercial and industrial or C&I accounted for more than $3 billion of this loan growth, although we experienced growth in every portfolio. The indirect auto loan portfolio increased $2 or 31% from a year ago quarter as originations remain strong and we continue to portfolio all of our production. As shown on slide 54 in the appendix, we continue to focus on the super prime space and have not sacrificed credit quality to drive volume. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in pricing. On last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we announced that we achieved price increases late in the quarter. Earlier this month we raised pricing again. As a result, new money yields averaged 3.08% during the fourth quarter and more recently, new money yields have been in the 3.10%. We continue to expect two auto loan securitizations during 2015 as we manage loan concentrations. Average C&I loans increased more than $1 billion or 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting trade finance in support of our middle market and corporate banking customers. The chart on the left side shows the net interest margin trend which we previously discussed. Turning to slide 12, the right side of this slide shows quarterly trends in our deposit mix and average cost of deposits, while the left side illustrates the maturity schedule of our CD book. Average core deposits in the 2014 fourth quarter increased $2.9 billion or 6% year-over-year. This increase benefited from $1.1 billion of core deposits acquired in the Camco acquisition and the Bank of America branch transaction. We remain focused on remixing our deposit base by increasing low cost core deposits while reducing our dependence on higher cost CDs. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.8 billion or 14% as compared to the 2013 fourth quarter, while average money market deposits increased $1.6 billion or 9%. Growth in these categories more than offset the intentional $0.9 billion or 22% decline in average core certificates of deposit. As show in the chart on the left side of the slide, the opportunity to reduce CD cost has diminished but remained focused on the opportunity to drive further improvement in the mix. There are two pieces of funding mix dynamic that you do not see on the slide. First, average short and long-term borrowings increased $2.9 billion or 78% year-over-year which includes $1.25 billion of bank debt issued during 2014. Second, average broker deposits increased $1 billion or 74% from the 2013 fourth quarter. Both of these funding sources provide a cost efficient means for funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth while maintaining an intense focus on managing our core deposit expense. Slide 13 shows the trends in our capital ratios. We remain well capitalized with reductions in our capital ratios throughout 2014 being driven by robust balance sheet growth as well as our active capital management strategies. We repurchased $334 million of our common stock over the course of the year including $35 million during the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had approximately $53 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization which we intend to complete in the first quarter of 2015. Slide 14 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit performance remains quite strong and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs decreased to 20 26 basis points in the fourth quarter, an improvement over both the prior and year ago quarters and well below our long-term expectation of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs this quarter benefited from the fifth consecutive quarter of net recoveries within our commercial real estate portfolio as well as a couple large recoveries within the C&I book. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans also posted continued improvement. The allowance for credit losses eased modestly consistent with the improvements in the overall portfolio. Criticized assets represented one of the few credit metrics that increased sequentially with about half of the increase due to two large unrelated credits that moved into special mention this quarter. Slide 15 shows the trends in our non-performing assets. The charts on the left demonstrate continued improvement, albeit at a reduced rate. The charts on the right show the NPA inflows which also improved modestly from the prior quarter. Turning to slide 16, the loan loss provision decreased to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting primarily continued improvement within the commercial real estate portfolio. The allowance-to-loan ratio decreased to 1.40%, down 7 basis points sequentially and 25 basis points year-over-year. The ratio of allowance to non-accrual loans improved to 222% up slightly from the prior quarter and roughly in line with the year ago. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the continued improvement in the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio. Let me now turn the presentation back over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Mac. Turning to slide 17, as I alluded to in my opening remarks, our fair play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR continues to drive new customer growth and improved product penetration. This slide illustrates the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households. And over the last year, consumer checking account households grew by 129,000 households or 10%. And the fourth quarter was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter due to seasonality, costumer activity and a reduction of our marketing programs made earlier in the year. If we exclude the impact of the Camco and Bank of America branch acquisitions, organic growth in consumer checking households was a healthy 6% for the year. Our strategy is not just about market share gains but also gains in share of wallet. We continue to focus on increasing the number of products and services we provide to the customers knowing that this will translate into revenue growth. Our OCR cross-sell goal of six or more products and services improved to almost 50% in our consumer account households this quarter, up more than 174 basis points from a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue for the fourth quarter is up 12% year-over-year. You can see on slide 18, commercial relationship growth has returned as we\u2019ve worked through the impact to the changes made in our business banking checking products that impacted a number of lower balance accounts. Commercial relationships increased 3% year-over-year. Excluding the impacts of the Camco and Bank of America branch acquisitions, organic growth in commercial relationships was 2% for the year. Our former product OCR cross-sell for commercial relationships improved almost 42% this quarter, up more than 4% from a year ago. Commercial relationship revenue for the fourth quarter grew 12% year-over-year. Slide 19 shows that we once again delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the full year 2014. We\u2019re recommitted to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year 2015. And as I noted earlier, positive operating leverage is now long-term goal for the company. Turning to slide 20 for some closing remarks and expectations. As we enter 2015, we\u2019re bullish on the economy and our footprint, particularly for consumers with home prices rebounding, at least a near term opportunity for additional mortgage refinancing and the benefit as the dramatic recent decline in energy cost just starting to be appreciated. State governments in our footprint are all operating with surpluses and most municipalities are on solid footing. Automobile sales were very strong last year and appear poised for another great if not even better year 2015. Our loan pipelines are stable; they are consistent with fourth quarter. And we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for continued growth. We\u2019ll continue to reinvest cash flows of approximately $100 million to $125 million per month from existing investment securities into LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets. In addition, we expect to add another $1 billion of additional level one HQLA as we prepare for LCR. Our portion of portion of the commercial team\u2019s production also will continue to be placed in the securities book. We expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving back up but we expect to grow revenue despite this pressure. We are maintaining our pricing discipline. We continue to monitor the securitization market and will look to use it as a tool to manage our overall concentration of indirect auto loans. We expect to do two securitizations in 2015. We will continue to invest in the franchise with expected expense growth of 2% to 4% for the full year. Excluding significant items if any and net MSR activity, we\u2019re committed to positive operating leverage on an annual basis which means revenue growth exceeding expense growth. We will grow revenues in \u201815, both fee and net interest income. We will not change our underwriting standards. We are long-term shareholders in management and at the board level. I\u2019m pleased to report we\u2019ve got good momentum in many of our business lines. And in my opinion this is the best entry position for a new year we\u2019ve had in my tenure here over the last six years. Finally, we continue to expect to see stabilization in credit trends. We expect net charge-offs will remain at or below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Provision was below our long-term expectations during this past quarter. Both are expected to continue to experience modest changes, given their absolute low levels. Longer term, we\u2019re managing the franchise to deliver consistent, strong shareholder returns. We\u2019ve built a strong consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. And we\u2019re executing our strategies and adjusting to operating environments whenever necessary. And there is a high level of alignment between employees and shareholders. We are both cognizant of and highly focused on our commitment to being the stewards of shareholders\u2019 capital. So, with that, let me turn it back to Todd. Todd Beekman : Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions and ask for the courtesy of your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And if that person has additional questions, we ask to add themselves back to the queue. Thank you. Anastasia? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Todd Beekman : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Good morning, guys. Actually Mac, maybe first one is for you. You talked about possibility of margin pressure and gave kind of the puts and takes. So, I wonder if you can spend -- expecting just talking about order of magnitude of margin pressure. I mean the funding remix that\u2019s an opportunity but the LCR, still bit of a headwind. You\u2019ve been doing maybe 1 or 2 basis points of core compression a quarter for a while. Is that still something seems fair going forward? Mac McCullough : Well, thanks Scott, thanks for the question. I think the way to think about it, we continue to see compression in certain loan portfolios as we see the re-pricing take place. Certainly there are some portfolios where we\u2019ve already crossed that line but we\u2019re not seeing significant or any re-pricing. We will see some pressure as we add securities for LCR. We\u2019ll about 1 billion incremental along with kind of having to repurchase about 100 million to 130 million a month from maturities. So, those things will add the margin pressure as well. Certainly there is not much room on the deposit side going forward. We do continue to grow demand deposits very nicely. And that is certainly going to help as we remix the deposits but continued pressure on the margin that will be outpaced by earning asset growth in 2015. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. Thank you. And maybe just separate question. So, I think we have a good sense for how you think on auto pricing, given your comments, Mac. But maybe Mac or Steve, just given the amount of attention that auto lending gets these days, if you could spend maybe another second, talking about sort of growth and credit prospects as you see from your position. Steve Steinour : We have been very consistent with our auto lending we show to you every quarter. If you look back over the last five years, our FICO bands are credibly tight [ph] our loan to values, new use moves a little bit depending on the year and new production by the auto manufacturers. But we\u2019re very bullish on auto. We think we\u2019re going to come off a very good year and have an even better one. Certainly there is consumer benefit coming by a refinance potential that exists today compounded with the lower price of the pump for gas, should help drive auto to even -- to no worse than last year. We\u2019re optimistic it\u2019s going to be a better year on the whole. And our discipline will remain in place and we expect our performance to continue at or better than prior periods. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill: All right. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much, guys. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is actually Josh [ph] covering for Ken. Can you speak to what you saw in mortgage banking this quarter? We saw from other banks that this held up a little stronger and you guys saw a little more weakness. Mac McCullough : What we saw on a year-over-year basis, we did have an MSR gain in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had MSR increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. So, I think that certainly impacted us quite a bit. Other than that, I think our production stats were in line with what we saw in the industry. And we certainly are seeing a pickup as we see what\u2019s happening today in the market. So, we do expect a better improvement in this line in 2015. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just more generally, can you speak to the revenue drivers for fee income in \u201815 where you are expecting to see the most growth or less growth? Mac McCullough : We certainly have seen a few areas in the fee income area that are showing strength due to our growth in households and also businesses as Steve mentioned earlier. We see capital markets increasing; we see the ATM and debit card fees increasing significantly both double-digit growth in the quarter. We do expect to see a better growth in non-interest income in 2015 relative to what we saw in 2014 as we probably bottomed out in mortgage. And again, as we discussed earlier, we are going to see good earning asset growth that will certainly offset any progression we see in 2015. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks for the time guys. Todd Beekman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mathew O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Todd Beekman : Good morning, Matt. Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : I was wondering if you could elaborate on the two credits that drove the increase in criticized assets. I guess first what industries were they in? Dan Neumeyer : Hey Matt, this is Dan. Yes, one was in metals, the supplier to the auto industry and the other was in natural resources, both legacy credits, both we feel very positive about their ultimate disposition. But we\u2019re trying to call these things early and make sure that we leave all of our options open for resolution. So, that comprise the majority of what would be considered more than normal inflow. And then we also have throughout the fourth quarter taken a very deep dive into all portfolios as we attempt to stay in front of any development front and still again calling the credits early and giving ourselves every opportunity for rehabilitation. Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : And I know there are some moving pieces because most of the credit metrics were quite good in terms of charge-offs, non-performers. But as you think about the higher criticized assets and then the loan loss reserve release this quarter, I guess I\u2019m surprised how much reserve release there was given the increase in criticized assets. Mac McCullough : Yes. So, there is a lot of components as to how we look at making sure we have an adequate and appropriate ACL. And most of the metrics as you know were very strong. So, we had a really low level of charge-offs, NPAs coming down and improving economy. And so, when you factor all those in and if we see a trend developing, we\u2019ll modify. But we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen a trend here. We think this is one quarter phenomenon and the increase in criticized. So, we feel very good about the level of ACL today. And again, we continue to have improvements in the C&I portfolio, continued recoveries in CRE which drove a lot of the reduction. So, on the whole we think we\u2019re right where we need to be. Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : And as we think about the reserve levels going forward, we think of them being closer to charge-offs or you start building a little bit or\u2026? Mac McCullough : Well clearly, we don\u2019t expect -- we\u2019re at our -- lower than where we expect to be on charge-offs, so I certainly don\u2019t see things getting better on that front from here. So, I think you can make you own assessment of that. Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is open Todd Beekman : Hey Bob. Bob Ramsey - FBR: Hey, good morning guys. I was hoping you could just touch on the sort of some of the through the cycle long-term goals. You talked about specifically your new return on tangible common equity goal and the efficiency number. Are those numbers that you hope to be able to touch at some point in 2015 or are these numbers that you really need higher rates or some other catalysts or bring you into that zone? Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks Bob, it\u2019s Mac. So, you certainly touched on one variable that is going to impact how soon we achieve the bottom end of some of these ranges and that is the rate environment. But clearly we\u2019re doing other things to make sure that we move in that direction. We\u2019ve talked about positive operating leverage; we\u2019ve talked about making sure that we manage our expense base as it relates to the revenue opportunity that we have in any one year. And that certainly is going to continue to move us towards the efficiency ratio target. As it relates to tangible common equity, we are continuing to make the right investments in the businesses that we think have the best returns going forward. We are looking through opportunities to optimize the existing balance sheet and in some cases making sure that we are being efficient in how we\u2019re using our balance sheet and certainly investing in higher return on equity businesses. So, this is going to be -- it\u2019s not going to happen overnight but certainly the things that we do every day, they head in the right direction are going to help us get there. And I would expect late 2015, 2016, we\u2019ll start to see the achievement of some of these ratios. Bob Ramsey - FBR: And will you see them in late 2015 or 2016 even if rates don\u2019t move up as sort of as expected or do you really need that rate move? I know it is helpful but is it absolutely necessary I guess? Mac McCullough : Yes. What I\u2019ll commit to is we\u2019re going to continue to make progress in the right direction and that rates will certainly help us get there but there are a lot of other things that we\u2019re doing that are going to help us achieve those ratios. Bob Ramsey - FBR: Okay. And then I guess similarly as you\u2019ll talk about your revenue growth expectations and any outlook for this year, does it move materially if there is -- if you do get a 50 basis-point move in rates in the back half of 2015, does it materially move the revenue numbers for 2015 or is it more of an impact the year after? Mac McCullough : Well clearly, it would be a larger impact for the year after, given any rate change later in the year really going to partial your benefit. Clearly, we\u2019ll get some pickup as rates increase. And certainly midyear or later seems to be what would be the best we can hope for. But the bigger impact would come in 2016. Bob Ramsey - FBR: Okay, all right. Thank you guys. Todd Beekman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Todd Beekman : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Just clarification, maybe for Dan or Mac on the provision. Are you saying you expect the provision to come back in line with charge-offs against during 2015? Dan Neumeyer : Actually we didn\u2019t say that. We are at a low point in terms of charge-offs. So, provision was lower this quarter than we have seen. Much of it\u2019s going to depend on loan growth and the state of the economy. But I would say it\u2019s probably likely the provision is not going to remain at this level or lower on a go forward basis. Mac McCullough : Yes. Jon, it\u2019s Mac. Obviously the provision is the outcome of how we think about we need from an appropriate reserve perspective and we just have a lot of very positive actions in the fourth quarter that in this provision number. I think the inflow of classified that we saw that\u2019s criticized that is obviously incorporated into the fourth quarter number. And we do feel comfortable with credit quality where it\u2019s out there. So, clearly we\u2019re at a low level relative to what we expect longer term. There could be some volatility as we move forward because we are at such a low level but I think a lot of things came together in the right direction this quarter to make that happen. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, good. Just another clarification point on the operating leverage number. Are you assuming $1.8 billion expense base in terms of expense growth before we go to the expense number? Mac McCullough : That\u2019s correct. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then just one more if I can Steve, you talked a little bit about energy prices. You do have some Marcellus and Utica overlap; on the other hand you have a big consumer base. How do you think about the puts and takes of low energy prices? Steve Steinour : I think it\u2019s tremendous for our region, both at the consumer but I\u2019d also say at a commercial level our businesses whether they are manufacturers, distributor services, they are going to benefit from lower energy costs, price of the pump whatever. Our energy exposure is very modest; it\u2019s part of strategy purposeful selection and a particularly slice in that market and if you will a go slow approach to make sure we are fully absorbing what we were -- and understanding what as we thought a little portfolio. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, all right. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Todd Beekman : Thanks Jon. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Hi. It\u2019s Geoff Elliot from Autonomous. On the natural resources, you mentioned that one of the new criticized loans was in that sector. So, could you just give us a bit more of detail on what the total exposure to that sector looks like and kind of how it breaks down between oil and gas, mining other kind of components of natural resources? Mac McCullough : Okay. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s a pretty broad category. When we talk about what we have; natural resources is the broadest of categories. Our E&P book which is how has been our energy vertical that has about 500 million of commitment and about 300 million or so in outstanding. And that is largely reserve base, syndicated deals that have broad geographic diversity. The entire energy category can define at a number of different ways but I think in terms of the oil and gas has primarily reserve based lending and\u2026 Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : About oil versus gas and\u2026 Mac McCullough : Sure. And our energy book is weighted towards natural gas. We do have about half dozen of ores that are oil heavy but the majority of the book is weighted towards natural gas. And again, reserve base, for the most part we do have a few midstream names in there as well. And I should emphasize that in that portfolio none of that was in the -- moved to criticized. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Okay. So, in [indiscernible] natural resources? Mac McCullough : Correct. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Great, thank you very much. Todd Beekman : Thank you, Geoff. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Todd Beekman : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Hi, everybody. I just had one follow-up question; I just wanted to make sure that I got the message clearly. And I think you are giving us so much detail for \u201815. The message that I\u2019m getting is regardless of the rate backdrop in the short end or long end, Huntington will grow revenues in \u201815 and post positive operating leverage. Mac McCullough : Right Erika, it\u2019s Mac. So, we are going to manage the expense base based on a revenue environment to achieve positive operating leverage. So, we do continue to see good earning asset growth which we believe will overcome any NIM pressure that we have in 2015. And we are going to see better growth in fee income in 2015 as well. So, yes, I think the positive operating leverage comment is a strong comment that we are committed to. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Got it. Thank you. Todd Beekman : Thanks Erika. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Steve Steinour : So, in summary, we\u2019re pleased with our performance for the full year 2014 and especially the fourth quarter. Results reflected the disciplined execution of our strategies and the strong competitive position of Huntington and our brand highlighted by superior customer service which is separating us from our peers. We continue to gain market share and improved share of wallet. We\u2019ve produced 4% annual revenue growth and positive operating leverage in a challenging. We also took demonstrable steps to improve efficiency and optimize the franchise. And finally, our board and this management team, we are all long-term shareholders; we remain focused on actively managing risk, reducing volatility while investing for top line growth achieving positive operating leverage. We\u2019re here to drive long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer and Rick Remiker, our Commercial Banking Director will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call. Let\u2019s get started by turning to slide five. Steve? Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. It's an exciting time for us at Huntington. Our first quarter results demonstrated the strength of our franchise and business model in a challenging external environment. We're very pleased with the results and believe that the first quarter sets us up well for the remainder of the year. We're focused on finishing 2015 strong and positioning for continued success in 2016 and beyond. Our current focus is on improving our already strong competitive position in consumer banking, small business and middle market banking including the specialty lending verticals by improving sales execution, developing new products and deepening customer relationships through OCR. Our commitment to smart accretive acquisitions was on display during the first quarter as we successfully completed the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance. We also announced the continued enhancement of our full-service branch network in a cost-efficient manner with the addition of 43 new in-store branches in Michigan. Slides six and seven show some of the financial highlights of the 2015 first quarter. Mac will discuss the details shortly, but I wanted to highlight a few of the items that I believe distinguish Huntington and illustrate our strategic execution. Good core balance sheet growth, along with strong performances from mortgage banking, and capital markets have set the tone for a solid quarter. We reported net income of $166 million a 11% increase year-over-year, an EPS of $0.19 a 12% year-over-year increase resulted in a 102% return on assets and 12.2% return on average tangible common equity. Total revenue increased 2% year-over-year which includes the impact of $17 million in securities gains in the first quarter of 2014 driven by 7% increase in the net interest income tied to strong balance sheet growth. Average loans and leases increased 10% from the year ago quarter and average total deposits increased 10% as well. The majority of deposit growth was due to an 8% increase in core deposits which we're very pleased with. Our focus on deepening relationships and earning primary banking status with our customers continues to benefit core deposit growth. On that note, I'm turning attention to slide six, we continue to see industry leading customer acquisition with 9% growth in consumer checking households and 5% growth in commercial relationships over the past year. With respect to the commercial growth rate in 2014 we implemented changes to our business banking products which caused approximately 10,000 lower balanced accounts to be closed over the course of the year. So the underlying core fundamentals were even stronger. We also continue to sell deeper across both our consumer and commercial relationships with more than half of our consumer relationships now have six or more products and services from Huntington and more than 42% of our commercial relationships have a cross-sell of 4% or higher. Slide seven has a few additional highlights from the first quarter. First our 2015 CCAR capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve for the upcoming five quarters through the 2016 second quarter our Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to $366 million of common shares. We successfully completed the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, and look forward to transitioning to the Huntington Technology Finance brand. We continue to be recognized for our focus on excellent customer service. For the second year in a row Greenwich Associates named Huntington one of the best commercial and business banks in the country. We also just received the 2014 TNS Choice Award for Consumer Banking in the Central Region which consists of 20 states in the middle of the country. So then this is the third time we've won this award and it's based on our strong performance in attracting new customers, satisfying and retaining customers and winning a larger share of the customers' total banking business. Finally, we repurchased 4.9 million common shares at an average price of $10.45 per share thus completing our previous buyback authorization from our 2014 CCAR capital plan. So with that, let me turn it over to Mac for a more detailed review of the numbers. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Slide eight is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. Steve touched on several of these, so let's move on to slide nine and drill on to the details. Relative to last year's first quarter, total revenue increased 2% to $707 million. As Steve mentioned, this includes the impact of $70 million securities gains in last year's first quarter. Spread revenue accounted for the entire increase as net interest income grew by 7%. Driving net interest income growth was a 11% increase in average earning assets. Loans accounted for the majority of the balance sheet growth increasing 10% over the previous year. Remainder of the balance sheet growth came in the securities portfolio as we continue our preparation for the upcoming Basel III liquidity coverage ratio requirement. The net interest margin compressed 12 basis points year-over-year to 3.15%. This decrease reflected a 15 basis points contraction and earning asset yields partially offset by 4 basis-point decline in funding costs. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin compressed 3 basis points exclusively related to lower earning asset yields. Fee income for the 2015 first quarter was $232 million a 7% decline from the year ago quarter. The decline was primarily driven by $17 million decrease in securities gains. The overall fee income decrease we continue to see the benefits of consumer and commercial customer growth as both electronic banking and capital markets income growth was strong year-over-year. Electronic banking increased 16% while capital markets fees increased 51%. Capital markets had a particularly strong quarter primarily driven by customer interest rate derivatives revenue. I also want to highlight a particularly strong quarter for mortgage banking. Mortgage banking income grew 64% on a linked quarter basis and mortgage pipelines remained strong and have no signs of slowing down. Reported noninterest expense in the 2015 first quarter was $459 million, a decrease of $1 million or less than 1% from a year ago quarter. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2014 did include $22 million in significant items. So on an adjusted year-over-year basis, noninterest expense increased 4%. Given the challenging interest rate environment, we are deeply focused on revenue generation and remain disciplined in managing expense in order to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year. Slide 10 details the trend of our balance sheet mix. As Steve mentioned earlier, average loans increased $4 billion or 10% year-over-year. While pipelines remained strong we are becoming more selective as there were certain segments within C&I and COE where structure and price are not consistent with our risk and return expectations. As we continue to manage credit risk to achieve lower relative volatility through the cycle, we may expect to see some moderation in C&I and COE loan growth in the near term. During the first quarter we experienced growth in every portfolio. However, indirect auto and C&I accounted for approximately three quarters of the growth. The indirect auto loan portfolio increased 29% from the year ago quarter. As shown on slide 54 in the appendix we continue to focus on the super prime space and have not sacrificed credit quality to drive volume. Production remained strong even as we have increased pricing multiple times in recent quarters. Recent new money yields have been around 3.20%. We moved $1 billion of auto loans to held for sale in anticipation of an auto securitization during the second quarter as we managed loan concentrations. Average C&I loans increased 8% year-over-year, primarily rebuffing trade finance in support of our middle market and corporate banking customers. Asset finance related to our Equipment Finance business, auto dealership financing and corporate banking. While growth and performance in the commercial real estate sector has been solid, we are exercising caution in this space as certain segments and geographies don\u2019t align well with our risk and return parameters. Turning our attention to the funding side, average total deposits increased to 10% over the previous four quarters including an 8% increase in core deposits. We remain focused on remixing our deposit base, increasing low cost core deposits while reducing our dependence on higher cost CDs. Average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased 16% from the 2014 first quarter reflecting our focus on consumer checking and commercial relationship growth. Average short and long-term borrowings increased by $1.4 billion year-over-year which includes $1 billion of bank level debt issued during the 2015 first quarter. Average brokered deposits increased $800 million during the same timeframe. Both of these funding sources provide a cost efficient means for funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth while maintaining focus on managing core deposit expense. Turning to slide 11, we see net interest margin barred against earning asset yield and interest bearing liability cost. The NIM compression continues due to the decreasing asset yields, strong loan growth more than offset the lower yields. Slide 12 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Capital ratios trended down during the quarter driven by continued strong balance sheet growth and the Macquarie acquisition and our active capital management strategies. We repurchased 4.9 million commons shares over the quarter completing the authorized buyback from our 2014 CCAR plan. One thing I want to highlight, starting this quarter we are showing our ratios on a Basel III basis including the standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets. Slide 13 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit performance remained solid and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs remained steady from last quarter at 20 basis points well below long-term expectations. Net charge-offs this quarter benefited from the sixth consecutive quarter of net recoveries within our commercial real estate portfolio as well as steady recoveries overall. The level of nonperforming loans did increase in the quarter with the increased level of inflows compared to prior quarters due largely to one C&I credit. The criticized asset ratio was fairly stable compared to the prior quarter as new problem inflows fell from the previous quarter's level. The allowance for credit losses eased modestly with the ACL ratio falling from the 1.40 last quarter to 1.38 this quarter. Slide 14 shows the trends of our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates an uptick in the quarter to 0.84%. The chart on the right shows the NPA inflows which were largely from one C&I credit. The increase over what had been a more typical level of inflows exhibited over the past quarter was primarily due to one larger credit that migrated in the quarter. Our estimation of the potential loss exposure associated with this credit was recognized in the quarter and is reflected in the 20 basis points of charge-offs. Turning to slide 15, the loan loss provision was $20.6 million in the first quarter compared to $24.4 million of charge-offs. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans fell to 181% due to the increased level of nonaccrual loans in the quarter. However, this level coverage remains very strong. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio. Let me now turn the presentation back over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mac. Turning to slide 16, as I alluded to in my opening remarks, our fair play banking philosophy, coupled with optimal customer relationship or OCR, continues to drive new customer growth and improve product penetration. This slide illustrates the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households and over the last year consumer checking account households grew by 9%. The first quarter was up a little over 1% from the prior quarter. Our strategy is not just about market share gains, but also gains in share of wallet. We continue to focus on increasing the number of products and services we've provided customers knowing that this will translate into revenue growth. Our OCR cross-sell goal of six or more products and services crossed the 50% mark this quarter up 202 basis points from a year ago and that's on the entire book. Correspondingly our consumer checking account household revenue for the fourth quarter is up 9% year-over-year. As you can see on slide 17, commercial relationship growth has returned as we work through the impact of the changes we made in our business banking checking products that impacted approximately 10,000 of lower balance accounts. Commercial relationships increased 5% year-over-year our four or more products OCR cross-sell for commercial relationships improved to almost 43% this quarter up more than 3% from a year ago. Slide 18 shows our current year-to-date operating leverage results. As I noted during last quarter's earnings conference call, year-long positive operating leverage is the long-term strategic goal for Huntington and we remain committed to delivering on that goal for 2015. One thing I want to note in the 2014 first quarter we realized $17 million in securities gains as part of our efforts to reposition the portfolio in preparation for the upcoming Basel III LCR rule implementation. On a year-over-year basis, the absence of these gains in the 2015 first quarter obviously hurt us from a comparison standpoint, but regardless we're confident in our ability to achieve positive operating leverage in 2015. Now turning to slide 19, for some closing remarks and expectations. We remain optimistic about the ongoing economic improvement in our footprint as well as on the national level. And while our loan pipelines are strong, we continue to be selective in growing commercial real estate and C&I portfolios. We're committed to delivering strong results in a flat interest rate environment. Our current budget has been built around the current rate environment and our execution is not dependent on our rate increase. We\u2019ll continue to reinvest cash flows of approximately $125 million to $150 million per month from the existing investment securities into LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets. The NIM pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving up, but we expect to grow revenue despite this pressure.  We are maintaining our credit structure and pricing discipline. We\u2019re not chasing growth where returns are inadequate or without regard to risk. Excluding significant items, net MSR activity and acquisitions, we\u2019re committed to positive operating leverage for the full year 2015 with revenue growth exceeding noninterest expense growth of 2% to 4%. Finally, we expect to see asset quality metrics near current levels. We expect net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. Modest changes are anticipated quarter-to-quarter given the absolute low level of our credit metrics. Longer-term we are managing the franchise to deliver consistent strong shareholder returns. We've built a strong consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We\u2019re executing our strategies and adjusting to our environment where necessary. In addition, there is a high level of alignment between employees and shareholders and we're highly focused on our commitment to be good stewards of shareholders' capital.  So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Muth : Thanks Steve. Operator, we will now take questions and we ask that out of courtesy of your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up question. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : I was hoping you could just spend a quick second expanding on just the sort of the nature of the One Credit slipped into non [indiscernible] that was commercial, but just any additional color that you could add? And then just sort of the follow up would be, but not kind of Steve you mentioned a couple times the more selective behavior on commercial and C&I growth, so just any additional color on the trends you\u2019re seeing what\u2019s causing there may be temper your growth there? Dan Neumeyer : Sure, good morning Scott, this is Dan. So on the One Credit it was still steel related and so we brought it into NPA, we actually have recognized what we think is the potential of exposure, so that is included in the 20 basis points of charge-offs that we recognized this quarter, so we feel we have the risk in that credit behind us. With regard to the portfolio more broadly and what we are seeing, clearly the market has as we've been saying for several quarters has been very comparative and so we still have a good deal pipeline, but we are being more selective. Our bankers understand our risk appetite. They are self selecting in certain cases to not bring deals forward, but we\u2019re looking at every deal very closely. We have our discipline in mind and so we\u2019re sticking to those disciplines and still it is achieving some pretty good growth rates. But overall the market continues to be very competitive in both structuring and pricing and that\u2019s really across the portfolio. Scott Siefers : Okay and then so, there is not one for example specific segment geography that\u2019s worse than the rest, it is just a more, perhaps a more conservative posture overall. Dan Neumeyer : Yes and I would say not more conservative, I mean we are sticking to our discipline. We've had our risk appetite and the corresponding parameters in place for long time and we're operating within those. So as the market gets more aggressive, it's going to be, there are going to be more cases, where we are going to opt out. Scott Siefers : Yes, okay, all right that makes sense. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : I\u2019m John Pancari of Evercore. Quick question on back to the loan growth commentary that you just gave, how should we think about the peak of loan growth given the likely moderation as you step away from some of these transactions, is it fair to assume that we see mid single digits or even low single digits given that as we move through '15. Mac McCullough : Hi, John, it\u2019s Mac. I would suggest that we will see some moderation in C&I and CRE going forward. I\u2019m not going to put a growth rate out there, but clearly this isn\u2019t a deal flow issue, this was just a risk appetiter discipline issue and we\u2019re still looking at same number of deals, but we\u2019re applying the same lens and the same filters to how we think about whether or we want to bring these deals into our book or not. So, as Steve mentioned, we\u2019re comfortable. As it relates to our plan for 2015, we anticipated this environment and we are going to have positive operating leverage for 2015. So all these things factor into how we are going to perform and what we believe the expectations are for 2015. John Pancari : Okay, great and then separately on the Auto, I was wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of color on the potential gain on sale margins that you are targeting on the pending auto securitization and do you still plan on pursuing two securitizations in \u201915? Thanks. Mac McCullough : So we do think that gain on sale is probably going to be about 50% of this work level relative to the last deal that we did and it's in line with our expectations, it's in line with how we think about this from the budget or a forecast perspective. We are continuing to evaluate the need for a second securitization in 2015, we\u2019ve seen some decline in growth in the indirect space and we\u2019re evaluating whether we need to do that late in 2015 or early in 2016, so that is still under consideration. John Pancari : Okay and then lastly just on the deposit service charges they were down 4% year-over-year, can you just I'm not sure if you gave any color on that, just assuming you'll give us some detail? Mac McCullough : Yes, so we made a change in the third quarter of last year related to fair play strategy just giving customers more time to have their deposits account against their balance and that basically cost us about $6 million a quarter starting in the third quarter of 2014, so we haven\u2019t quite swum through that yet, but that is the impact. John Pancari : Okay, thanks. Appreciate for taking my questions. Mac McCullough : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mat O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Mathew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Mat. Mathew O\u2019Connor: I was wondering if you could provide any of the financial impact from the equipment finance deal that you did. I would assume that\u2019s accretive to earnings since your financing it with cash, but any metrics or figures around that would be helpful? Mac McCullough : Yes, Mat it\u2019s Mac. So we haven\u2019t given a lot of details around the transaction. I will say that it is a very high quality, very nice growth rates and very high return on capital business. We have said that the yields on these assets are going to be the highest yields on our balance sheet and it's just an extremely well run business by people that we know and have a lot of respect for. So the return on tangible common equity is at least double of what we report as a company, so extremely good fit with our existing business. We are going to be able to expand the product set into business banking, in the small business and in the healthcare vertical that Rick runs, so really nice complimentary business for us. Mathew O\u2019Connor: And then are there any upfront costs in terms of the deal whether its retention or setting aside the loss reserves, anything that we should look for next quarter on that? Mac McCullough : So we did recognize the $3.4 million in the quarter related to integration and deal process associated with Macquarie deal. We will see some additional expense the reminder of the year. It is not significantly material relative to the size of the transaction and really no reserve impact this quarter. Mathew O\u2019Connor: Okay, alright so it is all in the run rate here. Mac McCullough : It is. Mathew O\u2019Connor: Okay, alright that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks Mat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Steven Alexopoulos : Hi, good morning guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : Regarding the linked quarter decline in the professional services fees ex the Macquarie deal, could you help us think about is that a permanent step down just giving your experience and going through CCAR and how should we think about that ramping through the year? Mac McCullough : Yes, I think it is a bit lumpy, as we think about some of the professional services we use for CCAR. I think that probably a pretty decent run rate as we think about going forward on average, but again there is going to be some volatility in that line. Steven Alexopoulos : I mean, do you expect it to ramp the way it didn\u2019t the prior year, I think you were almost 16 million in the fourth quarter or should we be less than that would be\u2026? Mac McCullough : It will be less than that. Remember, we had some expense associated with some strategy work that we did late last year that we\u2019re not going to repeat in this year. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay and then I just wanted follow up on John\u2019s question, can you just remind us, are you, do you typically include the gain on auto securitizations in your calculation for positive operating leverage? Thanks. Mac McCullough : We do include those gains in the operating leverage calculation, so that obviously will be in the second quarter fee income line and historically we included those gains in that calculation. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, thanks for the color. Mac McCullough : Thanks Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Hi, great thanks. A question on expenses, just want to make sure that we are actually using the right base number, because I saw that you reiterated your 2% to 4% growth and back at the one time, as I get 2014 expenses at $1.818 billion is that the right number that you\u2019re growing 2% to 4% on ? And kind of the followup also is just, I think you said you exclude the Macquarie expenses from that, but what are the Macquarie expenses that we should add to that number? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes, so I think the way to think about the 2014 base is, you should take 2014 reported and exclude the cyclical items that we identified for the full year, so remember we had acquisition integration expense associated with Camco and the Bank of America branches.  And we also had some franchise repositioning expense in the third and fourth quarters last year, so I think that it's important to think about it from that perspective. We have not disclosed any expense or revenue around Macquarie. And we won't be doing that on this call, but obviously as we think about acquisitions going forward and what happens to us in 2015, but the 2% to 4% is based on 2014 excluding those acquisition items. Ken Zerbe : Okay, so I guess if you\u2019re guiding to a number that we cannot replicate, meaning just with the Macquarie expenses we should basically start with the 2% to 4% and then add some more ambiguous number for other expenses, I mean is that the message that you are trying to convey with the guidance that is something more than the 2% to 4%? Mac McCullough : It will be more than the 2% to 4% perhaps. I mean the 2% to 4% is the range that we're comfortable with in terms of growth for 2015 and we do need to add the Macquarie expenses on to it. Obviously we are getting revenue with Macquarie as well and Macquarie has positive operating leverage as we think about the business that we're bringing into - in the income. So it should be additive to that when you think about positive operating leverage in 2015, I think the message that we\u2019re trying to convey is that even exclusive of an acquisition that could help us to achieve positive operating leverage. We are committed to positive operating leverage on the core, based upon the way we set the year up relative to the 2014 base. Ken Zerbe : Got it and sorry, did you provide the revenue addition for Macquarie or is that and do we know that yet? Mac McCullough : We didn\u2019t provide that no. Ken Zerbe : Okay. Alright, thank you very much. Mac McCullough : Thanks Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Bob Ramsey : Good morning guys. I know talking about Macquarie, you mentioned that the ROEs on our business are double with the standalone Huntington's ROE\u2019s are, just curious if that\u2019s also true on an ROE basis, if you kind take capitalization out of the equitation. Mac McCullough : It\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019ve looked at it that way. Yes pretty robust on ROEs, but it is a very high ROE business. So I will say it\u2019s got to be pretty close to that. Bob Ramsey : Okay is it I mean is \u2013 do you allocate a materially different amount of capital to that than your overall business or I guess it\u2019s in the same zip code? Mac McCullough : Yes it's in the same zip code and the ROAs are definitely accretive to our ROAs, so it\u2019s a very high return business and part of that has to do with the deal, the leases themselves and certainly it\u2019s the credit quality. Bob Ramsey : Okay and then thinking about that piece of it as well that the yield piece as you all put that $800 million of higher yielding loans on the balance sheet and $1 billion moves off of lower yielding auto loans that gets sold. How should we think about net interest margin in the second quarter? Mac McCullough : We\u2019re going to continue to see some pressure on the margin if you take a look on a linked quarter basis we\u2019re down 3 basis points and 2 basis points of that was really due to adding securities during the quarter. Where we think we need to be from an LCR perspective we\u2019re at about 90% right now. And so the incremental add in the securities book for LCR is going to be minimal. I will tell you that we\u2019re tracking the margin exactly as we expect it to see for 2015. So even though, we\u2019re seeing the contraction it will continue until we see some increase in interest rates. This is all within our expectations as it relates to the positive operating leverage, revenue growth and performance for 2015. Bob Ramsey : Okay, so even with the Macquarie higher yielding loans coming on the second quarter you would expect contraction in the second quarter or you just mean from a bigger higher level you have 2015 the direction is now and outside of the deal? Mac McCullough : I would say yes to both. Bob Ramsey : Okay, all right thank you. Mac McCullough : Great contraction Macquarie, second quarter, yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with the Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Erika. Mac McCullough : Good morning. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to ask a follow-up question, I\u2019m sorry to ask another question on the guidance, but as I\u2019m thinking about the base for Steve, for 2014 and we think about revenue growth, it does include a $17 million in securities gains, but excludes that MSR activity? Steve Steinour : That would be correct. Erika Najarian : Got it and this is a follow-up question to what the bottom line of question. You mentioned Steve in your prepared remarks that you\u2019re going to invest the $125 million to $150 million per month in cash flows into HQLA and I think I thought that the incremental add beyond that is going to be minimum. Did I catch that right and if so that minimal add would be how much and what would it be funded by? Steve Steinour : You did catch it right Erika. We added about $500 million in the first quarter. The monthly cash flow is going to give us between 125 and 150 that will substitute in as well. And net beyond that as Mac said was modest it\u2019s around $250 million. So we had started the year and reference a number of up to $1 billion. It looks like it\u2019s going to be at 750 now as we see the cash flows adjusting and 500 is already in. Erika Najarian : Got it and just as a follow-up to that would it be continue to fund by long-term debt and brokerage CDs and what would this split be? Steve Steinour : Well the increment is not that large, so we got a variety of funding sources we certainly could do a debt issuance later this year, but not committed. We had very good core deposit growth through the first quarter and looking to obviously keep as much core funded growth in deposits as possible moving forward. Erika Najarian : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Josh in for Ken. Thanks for taking our questions. Could you just speak to the potential for continued asset acquisitions. And the extent to which you\u2019re seeing new opportunities out there? Steve Steinour : Josh, this is Steve, we have \u2013 we continue to look at different opportunities and as we\u2019ve said over the years our preference would be to look at banks and non-banks in our footprint, but we\u2019re prepared to look at opportunities that sort of are on the shoulders of our existing footprint. There\u2019s a level of discussion that\u2019s in line with what we saw last year and so don\u2019t see a huge spike in activity at this point. Unidentified Analyst : Okay thanks, that\u2019s all we have. Steve Steinour : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you good morning. Can you talk about the attractiveness of auto securitization market pricing here versus funding directly from your balance sheet and perhaps if you could also remind us of the primary factors that are underlying your decision to retain versus sell? Mac McCullough : Yes hi, it\u2019s Mac. The primary factor driving us to consider securitization would just be concentration limits in our portfolio. We\u2019ve established these limits related to the amount of order that we run on our balance sheet and what\u2019s really driving this securitization in the second quarter is starting to bump up against the level that we just want to get back within I guess given us through to make further decisions later in the year. So it\u2019s not really an economic decision. Obviously economics do play into it, but from a concentration perspective that would be the first filter we would take a look at and then from a liquidity perspective just taking a look at funding sources, and cost of funding and loan deposit ratio, those types of metrics would be a secondary consideration. And then I would put really economics as being the third consideration. Bill Carcache : Okay and yes there\u2019s no retained interest the way that they are structured? Mac McCullough : Well off balance sheet for treatment that\u2019s correct. Bill Carcache : Right. Okay and I\u2019m sorry and then can you talk about still in terms of the relative attractiveness from a pricing perspective is there any kind of benefit versus funding directly from your balance sheet or is just overwhelmed by just a concentration limits that you described? Mac McCullough : Yes, it really is been driven by the concentration issues. Bill Carcache : Okay and then to the extent even where you would be willing to take perhaps what\u2019s a less attractive pricing, could you give a little bit of color on what the pricing looks like and that\u2019s my last question. Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes I mean, relative to keeping the loans on our balance sheet there certainly is an economic impact here it\u2019s fairly a reasonable number in terms of the trade off that we\u2019re making, but we\u2019re giving up revenue by going to the securitization. So again it\u2019s not the primary driver of why we\u2019re doing this. We certainly take that into consideration, but we made a commitment and we've got limits around probably thinking about concentration on the balance sheet. Bill Carcache : Understood. Thank you. Operator : So our next question comes from the line of Andy [indiscernible] Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : All my questions have been answered. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Oh hello there, just a question on the credit side in the fourth quarter you talked about a couple large basis related to natural resources and manufacturers papers related to natural resources and manufacturers of commercial vehicles this quarter, there is large case in the is real i on a large case in the steel industry, how do you think about when you still try are identify this as trend both of them just being a series of isolated large incidents? Dan Neumeyer : Yes well, we this is Dan, we evaluate the inflow of new criticize loans every quarter and we\u2019re looking at trends that might be developing in these larger cases they were kind idiosyncratic company specific, industry specific and one of the cases the natural resources credit we've actually already had a positive outcome on that deal. So, what we're trying to do is identify the credits very early in the process so that we have more options available to us for resolution and that has been to our advantage. We're finding that we bring these things in early, assess our options and so we've been able to move these problem loans through the system very quickly generally with good outcomes. So we are seeing, I think a fairly steady flow of problem credits. I think part of that is driven by the fact that the market has been quite aggressive going on several years now, but we're very comfortable with what we're seeing. We do not see trends developing but I obviously watch that very closely. Geoffrey Elliott : And how do you think about the health of the corporate sector more broadly I guess, your footprint is your exposure to lots of manufactures and exporters and I guess other macro kind of is conflicting and some obviously enterprises, but strong dollar they had been for exporters and how your discussions with those corporate clients are impacted by that going? Steve Steinour : Well, we have those conversations with all of our customers. We've looked at our portfolio and done assessment of those that have good portion of their volumes which are export related. We've also looked at those companies that have a large portion of their cost of goods that they are getting from overseas and there is positive and negative done on both sides of that. But in total we remain comfortable. We are obviously concentrated in the Midwest, so we have a big manufacturing concentration. But that's also what we know, and are very comfortable with and are close to the industries that we serve. So all-in-all I think on the whole we feel good about where our customer base is situated and many of them over the last few years have been working and bolstering their balance sheets and getting in good shape and so we're quite comfortable. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Your line is open. Chris Mutascio : I don\u2019t know if this question is for Mac or for Dan it is on the same lines on the credit quality. If I understand the released actually the one large credit that one to NPA that's roughly $35 million or majority of the $35 million to $37 million year-over-year increase in NPAs. But on a sequential quarter basis, I think NPAs were up more like $65 million. I know it's all from a low base, but I wondered if I can get some more color on the residual, difference between that $35 million on a year-over-year basis and the $65 million versus other types of large credits within the sequential quarter increase and then just a one commercial credit you outlined or is it smaller once and if so, any specific industries? Mac McCullough : Yes, so of the $65 million quarter-to-quarter increase this credit did represent the majority of that. We're not going to get specifics in terms of dollar amounts, but it did represent the majority of that increase and again we have recognized what we believe is the loss potential in that credit. We're always going to have a flow of additional deals, but there are no other large credits that drove that increase. Chris Mutascio : Okay, thank you. Dan Neumeyer : And no particular industry, so no emerging sort of industry risk. Mac McCullough : Correct. Steve Steinour : Thanks Chris. Chris Mutascio : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Steve Steinour : So thank you, this is Steve. We're grateful for your attendance. We're obviously pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Results reflected the ongoing disciplined execution of our strategies and the strong competitive position that we enjoy today at Huntington. We've received ongoing recognition around superior customer service and that helps further separate our brand from our peers. We continue to gain market share and we're improving our share of wallet in both of our customer segments. We produced revenue growth in a challenging environment. We remain focused on pricing and underwriting discipline as you heard. We've also completed the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance and look forward to integrating their business into our franchise. And finally, our Board and the management team, we're all long-term shareholders, so we remain focused on managing the risk, reducing volatility, while yet investing for top line growth and delivering positive operating leverage consistent with our expectations of long-term performance. So, thank you for your interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Leanne and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares\u2019 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Mark Muth : Thank you, Leanne and welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Slides 1 and 2 note several aspects of the basis of today\u2019s presentation. I encourage you to read these but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. And in that regard, I would direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings related material we released this morning and the related 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website. Turning to Slide 3, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. As noted on Slide 4, the presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call today. Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 5. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington and we think we have good results to share with you this morning. Over the past several years, we have followed a contrarian path built around our fair play philosophy and our welcoming culture. We have strong recognizable brands and differentiated product set and industry leading customer service. In addition we have been investing in our franchise building and expanding in a time when others have been focused squarely on cost cutting. We will continue to invest in our business although we will pace our investments to manage our positive operating leverage on an annual basis. Our second quarter results highlighted by solid revenue growth and improved margins provide proof that our strategies are working and the investments we\u2019ve undertaken over the past few years are paying off substantially. Our investments are yet mature and should continue to drive future revenue growth and future performance improvement. We remain focused on disciplined execution and we are well positioned to finish the year strong, delivering positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year as well as improved returns for shareholders. Slide 5 shows some of the financial highlights for the second quarter. Strong revenue growth for the record setting quarter resulting in net income growth of 19% over the same quarter of last year. Earnings per common share of $0.23 increased 21% year-over-year. These results equated to a 1.16 return on assets and a 14.4 return on tangible common equity. The underlying strength exhibited this quarter was broad based and included the impact of our acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance which we have rebranded Huntington Technology Finance or HTF. Total year-over-year revenue growth of 9% benefited equally from spread revenues and fee income. Net interest income grew 7% while fee income grew 13%. Healthy balance sheet growth included a 6% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases and a 9% in average deposits. For the second straight quarter deposit growth was driven largely by growth in core deposits which is a very encouraging trend as we continue to focus on deepening relationships and earning primary banking status with our customers. Core deposit growth more than fully funded loan growth over this period. While the value of our core deposits may not be fully appreciated in the current rate environment, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will provide true differentiation when interest rates begin to rise. Our credit quality remained very strong with only 21 basis points of net charge-offs and 81 basis points of non-performing assets. We repurchased 8.8 million common shares at an average price of $11.20 per share effectively returning more than 99 million of capital to shareholders. We also completed a 750 million indirect auto loan securitization during the quarter resulting in a net gain of 5 million. This securitization demonstrated investor\u2019s endorsement of the quality and consistency of our auto finance business, one of our distinctive capabilities. Finally we continue to be recognized for our focus on excellent customer service and our distinguished brand. During the quarter we were recognized by both J.D. Power and TNS for the third consecutive year for our customer\u2019s centric focus. We were also recognized by the American Banker for our strong reputation. Slide 7 is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. We've already touched on many of these, so let's move to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of the numbers. Relative to last year's second quarter, total revenue increased 9% to 780 million. We are very pleased with our strong revenue growth in this challenging environment. As I mentioned previously spread revenue and fee income accounted for roughly equal parts of the increase of the revenue. Spread revenues benefited from balance sheet growth as earning assets increased 10% year-over-year partially offset by continued NIM progression of 8 basis points. Spread revenues during the second quarter included 17 million of net interest income from HTF. Fee income for the 2015 second quarter was 282 million, a 13% increase from a year ago quarter. The primary components of the increase were a 60 million increase in mortgage banking income, 12 million in fee revenue from HTF and a 9 million increase on gains on the sale of loans which included a 5 million gain on the 750 million indirect auto loan securitization. Other fee income sources also posted double digit year-over-year growth rates including electronic banking and capital markets. We continue to see the benefits of consumer and commercial customer growth manifested in these areas. Deposit service charges also benefited from our robust customer growth as we have almost grown through the 6 million per quarter impact from changes to our consumer deposit growth -- our consumer deposited products including All Day Deposits implemented in July of last year. Reported non-interest expense in the second quarter was 492 million, an increase of 33 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. Recurring expense related to HTF was 16 million or almost half of the year-over-year increase. The second quarter also included 2 million of merger related expense that is not recorded as a significant item for the quarter but is expected to be recorded as a significant item for the year as we will complete the systems integration of HTF later in 2015. Slide 9 details the trends of our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased 3 billion or 6% year-over-year including 839 million of leases from the HTF acquisition. During last quarter's earnings call we mentioned that we expected lower second quarter growth in C&I and CRE due to our risk return expectations, and this was the case. However loan growth in our loan pipeline will strengthened later in the second quarter providing room for increased optimism in the back half of the year. Notably in the second quarter we experienced year-over-year growth in every loan portfolio. The indirect auto portfolio increased 10% from the year ago quarter. As shown on Slide 53 in the appendix our indirect auto operating model remains unchanged with our disciplined approach to the business reflected in the credit performance metrics. As mentioned in the opening remarks we completed a 750 million indirect auto loan securitization. Recall that we previously moved 1 billion of auto loans to help our sale and near the end of the quarter we moved the remaining 250 million of indirect auto loans back into the portfolio. After reviewing the existing and projected size of the overall auto portfolio relative to our concentration limit as well as the transaction economics, we opted to scale back to size of the securitization. This allows us to realize the longer term benefit of keeping these high quality assets on our balance sheet. Previously, we mentioned that we expected to complete an additional securitization during the latter half of 2015 or perhaps in early 2016. However completion of the securitization in the second quarter, we reexamined our appetite for indirect auto loans taking into consideration the strong consistent performance of the asset class during the past economic cycle and in the CCAR and DFAST stress test. As a result of this review we decided to raise our auto concentration limit from 150% of capital defined as Tier 1 capital plus reserves to 175% of capital. As such we no longer anticipate the need for an off balance sheet securitization in the back half of 2015. Turning attention to the right side of the balance sheet, averaged total deposits increased 9% over the year ago quarter including an 8% increase in core deposits. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 18% year-over-year reflecting our focus on the consumer checking and commercial relationship level. Specifically, commercial non-interest bearing deposits increased 19% year-over-year while consumer non-interest bearing deposits increased 15%. Total core deposits from commercial customers increased 17% year-over-year while total core deposits from consumers increased 2% as we continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher cost CDs into other less extensive deposit products. Importantly, the year-over-year growth in total core deposits more than funded our loan growth over this period. Average short and long-term borrowings increased by 1 billion year-over-year which includes 750 million and 1 billion of bank level senior debt issued during the 2014 second quarter and 2015 first quarter respectively. We also issued 750 million of bank level senior debt on the last day of the 2015 second quarter. Average brokerage deposits increased 600 million. These deposits provide a cost effective means for funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth while maintaining focus on managing core deposited expense. Turning to Slide 10, we see net interest margins spotted against earning asset yields and interest bearing liability cost. The NIM increased 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.20% primarily due to the addition of higher yielding assets from the HTF acquisition. In addition we recorded approximately 3 million of prepayment penalties within the securities portfolio, which added 2 basis points for the margin. These contributions were partially offset by continuing pricing pressure across most asset classes. The net interest margin decreased 8 basis points from the year ago quarter, also reflecting downward asset reprising pressure. Going forward, we expect pricing pressure to remain a headwind, as many asset classes continue to re-price lower while funding cost have limited room for improvement besides from continuing remixing them on deposit base. Slide 11 provides some detail on our current asset sensitivity and how we manage interest rate risk. For the past several years we have run a more neutral about position balance sheet compared to many of our peers in part related to our swap portfolio. These swaps were added at a time when the outlook suggested a prolonged period of consistently low rates. As shown in the top of -- the chart on top, our models estimate that net interest income will benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increase that\u2019s already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is consistent with our estimates from the past few quarters. In a hypothetical scenario without the 9.2 billion of asset swaps our models estimate that net interest income will benefit by approximately 4.3% in the same up 200 basis point ramp scenario. The chart at the bottom of the slide illustrates the weighted average life over asset and liability swaps. As well as the net impact of the swaps on our net interest income. As you can see on the green line, the asset swap portfolio continues to age in and had a weighted average life of 1.5 years at 6/30/15. As we have said it previously, our asset swap portfolio is the laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. Over the next two quarters 1 billion of these asset swaps will mature and an additional 3.5 billion will mature during 2016. The maturity of these swaps would increase our estimated asset sensitivity. Slide 12 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the first quarter, while tangible common equity remained relatively flat. We repurchase 8.8 million common shares over the quarter at an average price of $11.20 per share under our 366 million share repurchase authorization. We have 267 million in authorized capacity remaining from the next four quarters. Slide 13 provides an overview of our credit quality net trends. Credit performance remain solid and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs remain well controlled at 21 basis points, below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. The non-performing asset ratio fell slightly in the quarter due to lower inflows compared to the prior quarter as well as the higher number of loans returning to recurring [ph] status. The criticized asset ratio also improved in the quarter aided by an increase in the volume level upgrades in the past category. The allowance for credit losses ease modestly with the ACL ratio falling from 1.3% last quarter to 1.34% currently. All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed annual shared national credit exam. Slide 14 highlights trends in criticized assets, non-performing assets and delinquencies. The chart in the upper left shows a slight decrease in the NPA ratio for the quarter to 81 basis points. The level of NPAs has been fairly consistent over the past six quarters and is in line with our expectations. The chart in the upper right reflects continued improvement in our 90-day delinquencies with the improvement coming from both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The chart in the bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio which also improved in the quarter as new inflows of criticized assets were more than offset by upgrades and pay downs. Finally the chart on the bottom right shows a reduction in NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans fall in from 30 basis points to 26 basis points. Turning to Slide 15, the loan loss provision was 20.4 million in the second quarter compared to 25.4 million of charge-offs. The ratio of allowance for non-accrual loans remain steady at 180% compared to 181% in the prior quarter. The ACL ratio fell modestly to 1.34% from 1.38% in the prior quarter in line with modest overall improvement in credit metrics. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Mac. Slide 16 provides a quick snapshot for the long-term trends in our consumer and commercial customer acquisition. Our Fair Play banking philosophy coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus has substantially driven customer acquisition since its inception. As you can see we\u2019ve increased our consumer checking households and business relationships by almost 9% and 6% compound annual growth rates since 2010. We believe these are industry leading customer acquisition rates. These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the two lower charts on the slide. We\u2019re a company focused on revenue and revenue growth and we will continue to grow revenues despite the headwinds of the interest rate environment. We have seen our dedication to OCR payoff but to get the full picture we turn to Slide 17 and 18 and in doing so I want to stress that our strategy is not just about gaining market share but also gain in share of wallet. As we have shared with you previously the cornerstone of our OCR strategy is based around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers knowing that this will translate both into more loyal and satisfied customers as well as revenue growth. During the first quarter, our OCR consumer cross-sell goal of six or more consumer products and services crossed over the 50% mark for the first time. This figure increased an additional 80 basis points during the second quarter and now 51% of our consumer checking household use six or more products and services. Correspondingly our consumer checking account household revenue is up 9% year-over-year. Turning attention to the commercial side of Slide 18, our percentage of commercial customers with four or more accounts -- four or more products and services was 43.4%, up 70 basis points from the prior quarter and up 210 basis points from the year ago quarter. Again this is translated directly to revenue growth as commercial revenue increased 5% year-over-year. Slide 19 shows our year-to-date operating leverage results. Full year positive operating leverage is a long-term strategic goal for Huntington and a commitment we have made again for 2015. We significantly narrowed the gap in the second quarter moving from negative 1.7% at the end of the first quarter to negative 40 basis points at the midpoint of the year. We have strong revenue momentum and we will pace our continued investment in the franchise appropriately for the revenue outlook. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year both inclusive and exclusive of the impact of the Huntington Technology Finance. Turning to Slide 20 for some closing remarks on expectations. We remain optimistic about the ongoing economic improvement in our footprint. We are bullish on the Midwest economy. While average loan growth hit was decent this quarter we saw momentum building in our pipelines and in our loan growth during the latter half of the second quarter. Customer activity remains encouraging. Loan utilization rates showed a slight increase during the quarter giving additional reason for optimism. While competition remains intense, we will continue to be disciplined in growing our commercial real estate and C&I portfolios. We are committed to delivering strong results regardless of the interest rate environment. Our budget has been built around the current rate environment and our execution is not dependent on a rate increase. We control our destiny and our focus and execution will deliver results. Net interest margin improved this quarter with the impact of Huntington Technology Finance, however we expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving up. We expect to grow revenue despite the pressure. Fee revenue improved this quarter with electronic banking, treasury management, capital markets and mortgage banking, all demonstrating particularly strong momentum. We continue to invest in our businesses for the future resulting in projected non-interest expense growth of 2% to 4% for the year excluding significant items, net MSR activity and acquisitions. On a reported basis, we expect non-interest expenses will remain near the second quarter 2015 level for the rest of the year. We expect revenue growth in excess of expense growth and we are committed to positive operating leverage for full year 2015. We believe the asset quality metrics will remain near current levels. We expect net charge-offs will remain at or below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Modest changes are anticipated given the absolute low levels of our credit metrics. Longer term we continue to manage the franchise with an emphasis on consistent shareholder returns, we've built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We are executing our strategies and adjusting to the environment when necessary. While past investments continue to payoff we continue to move forward with investments in enhanced sales management, digital technology, data and analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. There is a high level of alignment between the Board, management and indeed all of employees and shareholders, and while we are highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders' capital. With that, I am going to turn it back to Mark Mark Muth : Leanne we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : On loan growth side, just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the C&I loan trends average show a pretty good growth, but on the end of period basis they were flattish, wanted to see if that\u2019s a number we should grow off of or is it the average trends that think are more sustainable there? Mac McCullough : This is Mac. So I do think what you're seeing in the quarter is consistent with the guidance we gave last quarter on the call. We do have good pipeline that picked up later in the quarter and we are being very disciplined in terms of how we think about this from our risk appetite and reward perspective. You know, I do think that if you adjust for the Macquarie acquisition and think about the end point of the quarter that would be a good starting point for growing off of. But again we did see strength in the latter part of the quarter and again it's what we expected when we announced last quarter. John Pancari : And then also on the loan fund as I follow-up, wanted to get your thoughts on auto loan growth, the growth on balance sheet balances given your commentary around the intent to retain more of your production. How should we think about growth in that portfolio going forward? Mac McCullough : I would tell you that the growth is pretty consistent with what you've seen historically. We have made some pricing changes that have impacted volume and some of this pricing changes have stuck. I think that it's important just to think about the environments and the fact that it is, but there is good opportunities for auto growth and we\u2019re going to be consistent with what we produce historically. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : I guess just sort of follow-up on the auto, why is it a good idea to increase concentration to auto, you obviously set that 150% for a reason and I know you guys do great underwriting. But it just seems that you're intentionally adding more risk and more concentration to a single asset class and I would love to know the rational to why that is? Dan Neumeyer : This is Dan. I think when you look at our auto portfolio and we measure a risk in volatility our auto portfolio has been one of the most consistent performers overtime and when we run our analysis and look at struck [ph] losses versus base losses is a very, very stable portfolio. We haven\u2019t had to adjust our underwriting perimeters in order to gain volumes, if you look at our FICO scores, our LTV's, the term, et cetera they have been rock solid over the cycle and we just think it's a great asset class and we don\u2019t think that at 175% of capital that that is outside at all. So we like the asset, we think it's proven itself and we think that level of concentration is very responsible. Ken Zerbe : And then the second question I had just in terms of the margins at 320 obviously pick up presumably due to HTF is 320 a decent starting point next or there was any unusual items and then we applied the margin compression on that 320, is that fair? Mac McCullough : It's Mac, so HTF added 7 basis points to the margin in the quarter and then there was about 2 basis points related to some security calls. So I think that\u2019s how you got to think about it going forward at least at the starting point. And then just keep in mind that we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in 2 to 4 basis points of compression on a quarterly basis and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Steven Alexopoulos : Let's just start looking at the 2% to 4% expense guidance which implies 1.9 billion of 2015 adjusted expenses, given where you were at the year-to-date point 946 million that implies a range of somewhere between 450 million and 470 million featuring the next two quarters. I am just curious given where the second quarter run rate came out, is there realistically any chance that you end up at the low end of the range, so 2% for the year, I was a bit surprised you didn\u2019t take up the guidance to at least maybe three to four something like that. Help us think about the range and why you are maintaining the guidance? Mac McCullough : It's Mac, so we do feel very comfortable that expense growth from the remainder of the year is going to be very consistent with what you see in the second quarter, so we think it's important to be consistent in the guidance that we provide and make sure that we report back to you on how we are performing against that guidance. And again even with all the investments that we have coming on later this year we are opening more in-stores, we continue to make investments in digital and other technology. We feel very comfortable with expenses being at the same level second quarter of 2015. Steven Alexopoulos : You think it's feasible that we could end up at the low end of that range? Mac McCullough : I\u2019ll leave that to you to decide based upon the guidance that we\u2019ve given here. But certainly we\u2019re comfortable stuck in second quarter levels. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. And I just wanted to follow up on raising the concentration limit of auto, can you just walk us through? So what's exactly is changing, is it better quality business reviewing, are you responding to pressure in C&I and other areas, is that way you are raising the limit? Mac McCullough : I think it really, again the limit goes to when we look across the portfolio where is there less volatility, where we have the historical performance, et cetera. What's the allocation we want in the various asset classes on a relative basis and we think that one, we don\u2019t think 150 to 175 is significant, but we think it's fully supportive based on the results, and past history and where we want to book to go in the future. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the lines of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning guys. If I could follow up on the fee side. I just wanted to ask about you mentioned been really strong quarter for mortgage partially on the production side, also on the MSR, what your outlook would be there? And then secondly, the other line with the 12 million helper from HTF, is that consistent of a fee generator also in terms of run rating that level? Mac McCullough : Yes, Ken, it's Mac. So we have a good performance in mortgage and we do expect continued performance. Keep in mind we did have 6 million in MSR pickup in the quarter and we certainly don\u2019t forecast either gains or losses when we put together our models. So we do think that mortgage is going to be a good contributor to revenue growth for the remainder of the year. And when you think about HTF and the revenue on the fee side, we do think that that\u2019s a good base to build off of. Ken Usdin : Okay. So my quick follow up here would just be on HTF in aggregate the revenue that we saw both -- and expenses across the board, this is all kind of the right run rate aside from future growth, right. So what was in the 7 basis points in NIM, the 12 in fees and then the amount of expenses accounted [ph] with good go forwards spots? Mac McCullough : Yes, so, very, very comfortable with that. And one thing I would point out is that HTF did have some operating leases and we're not going to be booking operating leases going forward. So you will start to see, if there's $8 million of revenue in the quarter and $6 million of expense in the quarter related to operating leases, those items will start to run off. But they will be replaced, obviously, on the balance sheet with new production that won\u2019t be operating leases. So you need to think about the timing of how you adjust your fee revenue and your expenses, but just want to make you aware of that. Ken Usdin : Okay thanks for that Mac, appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Mac I was wondering if you could walk us through how we should expect the balance sheet to grow especially relative to where you are or where you want to be on LCR. How we should think about earning asset growth relative to loan growth? Mac McCullough : So Erika I would tell you that where we need to be for LCR for 2015 and as we think about what we're going to do going forward to get to 100% we're not going to increase the size of the security portfolio. So we are basically going to be able to take cash flow from the securities portfolio and get the securities that we need to be compliant with LCR at a 100% level. So you won't see the balance sheet grow due to selling compliant with LCR. Erika Najarian : Got it. And so the pace of balance sheet growth should be roughly equivalent to that of our loan growth assumption. Mac McCullough : That\u2019s exactly right. Erika Najarian : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : I wanted to ask on the new slide that you've given us on the impact of swaps. I am talking what net interest income sensitivity would look like if those swaps rolled off. Is that an indication of intend to at all? If rates pan out as you are expecting, are you planning to bring the swap portfolio down or is that purely kind of hypothetical exercise at this point? Mac McCullough : So we've been pretty consistent in talking about our comfort with the way the swap portfolio is laddered and the way the swaps are rolling off naturally. We provided some guidance around 1 billion of swaps coming off in 2015 and an additional 3.5 billion in 2016 and those are the natural maturities of the portfolio. So we feel very comfortable with that. Geoffrey Elliott : And so the intension is not replace them by putting on new swaps? Mac McCullough : That our current intent, we feel like this was a very wise thing for us to do in the rate environment we were in, it actually protected the margin significantly and helped us manage interest rate risk on the balance sheet and we think the timing of these swaps and their current maturities is advantageous for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Long from Raymond James. Your line is open. David Long : In regard to your expansion in Michigan with the new in-store locations in the Meijer Superstore, what kind of expenses did you see here in the second quarter from that initiative? And then with those opening I know about July 1st, what will be the pickup in expenses we should expect here in the third quarter? Mac McCullough : It's Mac, we\u2019ve got 30 new locations set to open in third quarter, another 10 in the fourth quarter. And you need to keep in mind that we do hire the bankers 60 to 90 days in advance for opening those stores. The remainder of the expenses you can expect to see come online as we open those branches. So not going to go into detail around those specifics of incremental expense related to the expansion, but again I\u2019ll take you back to the expense guidance that we\u2019ve given and we\u2019re very comfortable with second quarter levels. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Mac I was hoping you could maybe just flash out, sort of what\u2019s going on in overall commercial yields and I guess just kind of pace of degradation. I get what you said about pricing pressure is going to continue, but it can be little tough from outside to given the impact of HTF kind of the pace of degradation whether that softened at all in the second quarter, what are your thoughts there? Dan Neumeyer : This is Dan, I think that while there continues to be pressure, I do feel that it is starting to stabilize a little bit. So I think the pace of the pricing pressure and structural pressures is maybe leveling out a little bit. So maybe a lesser reduction on a go forward basis than what we\u2019ve experienced today. Scott Siefers : And Mac just sort of tricky-tact question, what level if any of integration charges are you expecting per quarter in the second half for the year? Mac McCullough : I would suggest it's not going to be a material number, it's actually the cost to integrate HTF on full rate [ph] is one of the lowest cost I have ever seen in immigration. So it's really not material. Scott Siefers : So in other words the expense guidance for the second half you reported and that\u2019s a core number you're expecting as well? Mac McCullough : That\u2019s a way to think about it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open. Terry McEvoy : You have nice quarter-over-quarter increase in service charges is there any way to separate what is seasonal versus what\u2019s connected to your growing customer base and so is that growth in fees coming from just more customers and does that more than offset what\u2019s going on across the industry in terms of declining fees? Mac McCullough : So I think the way to think about it, second quarter is typically seasonally strong and I think if you go back and take a look overtime and just get an idea what happens there that\u2019s one way to think about it. It\u2019s probably a little bit more difficult for us because a Fair Play and some other changes that we\u2019ve made. Clearly when you think about the way we acquired new households and commercial customers, a lot of the growth in the new customers have really helped us overcome, some of the changes we\u2019ve made on the Fair Play side. And then with our focus on OCR and deepening relationships that\u2019s been very beneficial as well. And particular treasury management which -- some of the revenue associated with treasury management gets recorded in that line and we\u2019ve had very strong growth in treasury management. And the last thing I\u2019d point out is that we did make some changes in July of last year that costs us about $6 million a quarter in service charges and we\u2019re basically through that impact at this point. So I would expect to see some favorable growth in service charges for the remainder of the year. Terry McEvoy : And then you\u2019ve been showing these consumer and commercial relationship product penetration slides for years and they are all up into the right and I guess Mac my question is, what category either consumer commercial is more important for achieving the positive operating leverage, which one should we look at before the other? Mac McCullough : It's a great question, I think they both have contributed in a pretty material way. I think we\u2019ve had better success in revenue growth related to new customer relationships on the commercial side, I think the bigger opportunity going forward is on the consumer side. So that\u2019s probably how I would think about it. I think a lot of the investments we\u2019ve made on the commercial side of the business particularly on the fee side have paid-off very nicely for us and as we think about the opportunity to deepen relationships on the consumer side of the business going forward and take advantage of all the new households, we\u2019ve brought to the organization that is going to be a nice driver for us going forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom from RBC. Your line is open. Jon Arfstrom : Couple of follow ups here, just one on asset sensitivity, may be, but non-interest bearing deposits have become a much large piece of your deposit base over the past several years. I am just curious how you expect those balances to behave in a rising rate environment? In other words, is the growth driven by consumer household accounts or something else in there that may [indiscernible]? Stephen Steinour : This is Steve, we started with a strategy of share of wallet along with the share of market. And so we measured loyalty and retention and how that was impacted as we increased share of wallet. Therefore we expect our DDA to be very sticky as a consequences of cross-sell that we've been able to add on both the consumer and the commercial. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. That's helpful. And then a follow up for may be Mac on the accelerated expansion you talked about the branches that are coming online in Q3 and Q4. The incremental expenses done at the end of Q4? Mac McCullough : There might a few branches that will meet into 2016, but I think for all practical purposes we accrue no expenses around Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Mac I want to touch a little bit about the decision to move around the interest rate sensitivity. You have been keeping it very neutral position which has helped the net interest margin. As you are letting things mature you are giving up a pretty wide spread with the steepness of your curve, and you are going to take all of that 4.3% increase in asset sensitivity really to replace what you are giving up on the interest rate swap. So there is trade off and I just wanted you to kind of talk a little bit on how you are thinking about that? Mac McCullough : Yes, thanks Marty. So I do think, and we talked about this quite a bit historically that the swaps that we put on and when we put them on, actually did a great job in protecting the margin and you and I talked about that quite a bit. But when we put these on, we didn\u2019t put them on from thinking about a timing perspective and as we let them mature we're not really thinking about it in terms of trying to time what's happening in the market place. We do have a belief as I think most do, the rates are going to rise, if it's not in third or fourth quarter, certainly it will be early next year. And when we think about just the natural maturity of the portfolio it seems like it's the right thing to do just to let these swaps mature. So that's the way we think about it and certainly we're not trying to thread the needle here. Marty Mosby : The only thing I was, kind looking at is the 4.3% of pickup, gives you about $20 million worth of earnings as rates go up, a full 200 basis points if you look prorating the benefit of the 26 million that is kind of came up with your running off all those asset swaps, you were planning on giving up about $18 million. So it really looks like you are giving up current earnings to wait on the fed funds rate to go up 200 basis points and keeping a neutral balance sheet is always probably the overall goal not be one way or the other. Mac McCullough : Right, which is the way we thought about it and we have disclosed historically, that we had historically 4 billion to 5 billion of asset swaps on throughout the cycle. So we certainly do think about how to hedge the balance sheet but again we are not trying to thread the needle here. Marty Mosby : Got you. Thanks so much. Operator : And this concludes our question and answer session for today. I'll now turn the call back over for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : We are pleased with what was a record breaking second quarter. Results show that our investments are paying off, our strategies are working, and our execution is focused and strong, and we continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet and show no signs of slowing down. We have produced revenue growth of 9% in a challenging environment while remaining focused on pricing and underwriting discipline. In addition, we made significant progress on the integration of Huntington Technology Finance and are excited about the return profile this business provides. HTF will be a great deal for Huntington shareholders. With that said, there's always work to be done. We can do better and I don\u2019t want you think we\u2019re content with one record quarter. While we continue to make progress on improving efficiency, we still have significant opportunity for improvement to achieve our long-term goal of an efficiency ratio in the 55% to 59% range. As our past and current adjustments in the businesses mature, we will continue to become more efficient and move towards that goal. I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility, achieving positive operating leverage and driving solid, consistent, long-term performance and we\u2019re well aligned in these priorities.

My name is Keith and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares\u2019 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Mark Muth : Thank you and welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about an hour from the close of the call. Slides 1 and 2 note several aspects of the basis of today\u2019s presentation. I encourage you to read these but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. And in that regard, I would direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings related material we released this morning and the related Form 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website. Turning to Slide 3, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. As noted on Slide 4, the presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call. Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 5. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington. Since 2009, we\u2019ve executed a well-defined strategy designed to grow market share and share-of-wallet. We introduced our fair play philosophy, our welcome culture and became known for our strong recognized whole brand, differentiated product set and industry leading customer service. In addition we invested in our franchise, building and expanding at a time when others were focused fairly on cost cutting. We plan to continue to invest on our business, although as we have stated before we will pace our investments to manage proportion of operating leverage on an annual basis. Our third quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and the investments we\u2019ve undertaken over the past few years are continuing to pay off. We produced solid revenue growth despite the challenging interest rate environment. Our investments none of which are mature continue to drive future performance in revenue growth. We remain focused on disciplined execution. For the second quarter in a row we closed the GAAP on year-to-date operating leverage and we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year. Slide 5 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.18 was flat with the year ago quarter, while tangible book value per share increased 5% year-over-year to $6.88. As we disclosed in 8K filed on September 29, we received an unfavorable ruling on a decade old legal matter resulting in a $38 million or $0.03 per share charge in the quarter as noted in the significant items disclosure. We\u2019re fully reserved on the matter and we will be appealing the ruling. Year-over-year revenue growth was 5%, with both the net interest income and noninterest income contributing to the increase. High quality balance sheet growth including 6% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases and 10% increase in average core deposits. As we noted last quarter, while the value of core deposits may not be fully appreciated by the market in the current rate environment, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will prove to be a key differentiator once interest rates begin to rise. Our credit quality remains very strong with only 13 basis points of net charge offs and 77 basis points of non-performing assets. Our capital ratios remain strong as well. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89% while common equity Tier 1 was 9.72%. Slide 6 provides the summary of income statement including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to last year\u2019s third quarter, total revenue increased 5% to 757 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as we benefited from 8% average earning asset growth partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression. We continue to manage the net interest margin. We had disciplined pricing of both loans and deposits. Noninterest income increased 2% from the year ago quarter. Highlights from the quarter included a 9% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and 13% increase in electronic banking income, both reflecting continuous strong consumer and business acquisition. Recall that the year ago quarter included a 6 million per quarter negative impact of deposit service charges from changes to our consumer deposit products including all day deposit implemented in July of last year. As this quarter\u2019s results demonstrate, we have now more than overcome that step down. Capital market fees increased 24% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing benefit of past investment and is key revenue capability for our commercial customers. Mortgage banking income declined 24% from the year ago quarter as 8 million MSR impairment more than offset 5 million increase in mortgage origination in secondary marketing revenues. Our wealth businesses were negatively impacted by the planned product substitution in our broker dealer following our 2014 transition to an open architectural platform and our strategy to move to more predictable revenue streams within the business. Trust services income decreased 11%, while brokerage income decreased 12%. During the quarter we announced agreements the transition are remaining equity and money market funds to our\u2013to other fund families and to sell Huntington asset advisors, the current advisor for the funds. We expect these transactions will close during the fourth quarter with an immaterial impact on our 2016 run rate. Recall that we previously transitioned our fixed income funds during the second quarter of 2014. Reported noninterest expense in the third quarter was 527 million, an increase of 46 million or 10% from the year ago quarter. This quarter\u2019s noninterest expense included two significant items, the previously mentioned 38 million addition to litigation reserves and 5 million of merger related expense from the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition earlier this year, the pending transition of the Huntington funds and the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors. Noninterest expense adjusted for significant items, increased 26 million or 6%. Slide 7 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased 2.9 billion or 6% year-over-year as we experienced year-over-year growth in every portfolio. Average commercial and industrial loans grew 1.2 billion or 7%, while average automobile loans grew 0.9 billion or 11%. The year-over-year growth in the C&I portfolio primarily reflected growth in asset finance including the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition, corporate banking and auto dealer floorplan lending. The 2015 third quarter represented the seventh consecutive quarter of indirect auto loan originations in excess of 1 billion. Auto finance remains a core component to Huntington and is detailed on the slides and the appendix. We\u2019ve remained consistent in our strategy which is built around a dealer centric model and focused on prime borrowers. Our underwriting has not changed and the portfolio continues to perform very well. Average securities increased 1.6 billion or 13% year-over-year. Approximately 600 million of this increase related to direct purchase of small of municipal instruments originated by our Commercial lending team. Turning attention to the right side of the balance sheet, average deposits increased 5.4 billion or 11% over the year ago quarter including 4.8 billion or 10% increase in core deposits. Average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased 21% year-over-year and average interest bearing demand deposits increased 12%. These increases reflect our continued focus on consumer checking, household and commercial relationship growth. Other core deposit categories continue to benefit from our efforts to deepen banking relationships and to increase our share of wallet. Average money market deposits increased 9% year-over-year and average savings increased 4%. We continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher cost CDs and to other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs decreased 20% year-over-year. Importantly the year-over-year growth in total core deposits more than fully funded our earning asset growth over this period. The strong core deposit growth also allowed us to pay down some short-term wholesale funding as average short-term borrowings and federal home loan bank advances decreased 2.7 billion year-over-year. Average long-term debt increased 2.5 billion as a result of three bank level senior debt issuances this year including 500 million increase - issued during the 2015 third quarter. Average broker deposits increased 500 million. These wholesale funding sources provided a cost efficient means of funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth for maintaining brokers on managing core deposit expense. Slide 8 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields and interest bearing liability cost. The net interest margin decreased 4 basis points year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to 3.16%. Recall the 2015 second quarter, net interest margin benefited from $3 million of prepayment penalties within the securities portfolio which added 2 basis points, similarly the 2015 third quarter net interest margin benefited from $3 million as well, again 2 basis points from interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans. We continue to experience pricing pressure across most asset classes in the quarter in addition the bank level senior debt issuances have increased our cost of funds on the margin. Going forward we expect net interest margin pressure to remain a headwind consistent with recent experience. Slide 9 provides some details on our current asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. For the past several years we have run a more neutral balance sheet in many of our peers, in part related to our swap portfolio. The swaps were added in light of the outlook for prolonged low rates and helped us support our net interest margin over this period. As shown on the chart on the top, our modeling estimates that net interest income would benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is consistent with estimates of the past several quarters. In a hypothetical scenario with 9 billion of asset swaps - without the 9 billion on asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 3.9% in the up 200 basis point ramp scenario. The chart at the bottom of the slide illustrates the weighted average life of our asset and liabilities swap portfolios as well as the net impact of the swaps and our net interest income, including an incremental 28 million in the 2015 third quarter. As you can see in the green line, the asset swap portfolio continues to age in and had a weighted average life of 1.3 years at quarter end. As we stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. During the 2015 fourth quarter an additional 800 million of these asset swaps will mature and at an additional 3.6 billion will mature during 2016. LLC for these swap maturities would increase our estimated asset sensitivity. Slide 10 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our risk based regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the prior quarter end, while transfer common equity or TCE remained relatively flat. We repurchased 6.8 million common shares during the third quarter at an average price of $10.66 per share, effectively returning more than 72 million of capital to shareholders. We have about 195 million of authorized capacity remaining for the next three quarters under 366 million share repurchase authorization. Slide 11 provides an overview of our provision, charge offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remain solid and in line with our expectations. The loan loss provision was 22.5 million in the third quarter compared to 16.2 million of net charge offs. Net charge offs were well controlled at 13 basis points, remaining well below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. The ACL ration fell modestly to 1.32% of loans and leases from 1.34% of the prior quarter end, in line with modest overall improvements in credit metrics. The ratio of loans to nonaccrual loans increased to 184% compared to 180% a quarter ago. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio. Slide 12 highlights trends and criticized assets, non-performing assets and delinquencies. The chart in the upper left shows a slight decrease in the non-performing asset ratio for the quarter to 77 basis points. The NPA ratio is slightly for the second quarter in a row due primarily for higher payments on existing problem loans. The chart on the upper right reflects [indiscernible] improvement on our 90 day delinquencies with the improvement driven by the consumer loan portfolios. The bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio which also improved for the second consecutive quarter due to a noticeable reduction in the amount of new criticized inflows in the quarter. Finally, the chart in the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans increasing slightly to 29 basis points from 26 basis points last quarter. I mean, I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Steve. Steve Steinour Thank you, Mac. Slide 14 provides the snapshot of the long-term trends in our consumer and commercial customer acquisition. Our fair play banking philosophy coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus continues to drive, we believe industry leading customer acquisition. We\u2019ve increased our consumer checking, households and business relationships by almost 9% and 6% compound annual growth rates since 2010. These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the two lower charts on the slide. A particular note, the last two quarters have shown improved momentum in the consumer household revenue metrics as we\u2019ve lapped the last fee change we implemented under our fair play philosophy last August and realized the benefit of the underlying customer growth. We remain focused revenues and we continue to grow revenues despite the headwinds of the interest rate environment. As we have stated before, our strategy is not just about gaining market share but also gaining share-of-wallet, slides 14 and 15 illustrate the success of our LCR strategy in deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. As we\u2019ve shared with you previously the corner stone of our LCR strategy is based around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers, knowing that this will translate both into more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth. During the first quarter of this year our LCR crossed our goal of six or more consumer products and services, crossed over the 50% mark for the first time. At the end of the third quarter this figure improved to more than 51% of our entire consumer checking households using six or more products or services. Correspondingly our consumer checking account household revenue is up 11% year-over-year. Turning attention to the commercial slide on fifth - on slide 15, our percentage of commercial customers with four or more accounts was 43.7%, up 30 basis points from the prior quarter and up 250 basis points from the year ago quarter. Again, this is translated directly to revenue growth, as commercial revenue increased 8% year-over-year. During conferences the past few quarters and during calls with our investor relation team, many of you have expressed the desire to better understand the economic strength and underlying trends in our footprint and so we\u2019ve added slides 16 and 17 this quarter to help address those questions. We hope you find this beneficial. Since the economic recovery began, 2008 or 2009, economic activity in the key states of Ohio, Michigan and Indiana which account for approximately 90% of our business as measured by deposits, has grown faster than the national average. This outperformance has persisted through the past three months and based on the Philadelphia\u2019s edge state [ph] leading indexes is expected to persist for the next six months. Chart on the bottom of slide 16 shows the unemployment rates in most of our footprint states continue to trend positively and most are in line with or better than the national average. One out layer is the state of West Virginia which continues to struggle with the impact of lower coal prices. Slide 17 shows the current and year ago unemployment rates for our ten largest deposit markets. These MSAs account for more than 80% of our total deposit franchise. As detailed in the chart, all of these markets continue to trend favorably. Slide 18 shows our year-to-date operating leverage results. Full year positive operating leverage is a long-term strategic goal for Huntington and a commitment we\u2019ve made again for 2015. For the second quarter in a row, we narrow the gap on operating leverage, moving from 1.7% negative at the end of the first quarter to negative 40 basis points at the midpoint of the year and now to negative 10 basis points at the end of the third quarter. We\u2019ve strong revenue momentum and we\u2019ll pace or continue to investment to franchise appropriately for the revenue outlook. Therefore we remain confident in our ability to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year, both inclusive and exclusive of the impact of Huntington Technology Finance. Turning to slide 19 for some closing remarks and expectations, we remain optimistic about ongoing economic improvements in our foot print. While we\u2019re monitoring certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by global macroeconomic developments, we remain bullish on the mid west economy as a whole. Customer sediment is positive, loan pipelines are encouraging, loan mutualization rates showed a slight increase for the second consecutive quarter. While competition remains intense, we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in growing our commercial real estate and our C&I portfolios along with our consumer portfolios. We\u2019re committed to delivering strong results regardless of the interest rate environment. A 2015 budget was built around the current rate environment and the achievement of our goals is not dependant on a rate increase. We will follow a similarly prudent approach as we plan and budget for 2016. We control our own destiny and our focus and execution will deliver results. The relative stability of our net interest margin has been a key component in our revenue growth and maintaining our pricing discipline remains a key focus for Huntington going forward. While we expect pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving back up, we expect to grow revenue despite this pressure. The benefit of our robust customer acquisition and OCR cross sale strategy was apparent as fee revenue improved this quarter with service charges on deposit accounts, electronic banking, treasury management, capital markets all contributing to the performance. We continue to invest in our businesses for the future, resulting in projected noninterest expense growth of 2% to 4% for the year excluding significant item that MSR activity and acquisition. We expect fourth quarter noninterest expenses excluding significant items will remain consistent with the adjusted noninterest expense levels of the prior two quarters. We expect full year 2015 revenue growth in excess of expense growth with committed positive operating leverage for the full year of 2015, again both inclusive and exclusive of Huntington Technology Finance. We believe the asset quality metrics will remain near current levels. We expect net charge offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. Modest changes are anticipated given the absolute low levels of our credit metrics. While we try and continue to be as a franchise with an emphasis on consistent shareholder returns, we build a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We\u2019re executing our strategies and adjusting to our environment were necessary. While past investments continue to pay off, we continue to move forward with further investments and enhance sales management, digital technology, data and analytics in optimizing our retail distribution network. None of our investments are matured. There\u2019s a high level of alignment between the board, management and all of our employees and shareholders and we\u2019re highly focused on our commitments to being good stewards of shareholder capital. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Muth : Thanks, Steve. Operator we\u2019ll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy of your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Just on the margin front. Just wanted to get a little bit color on the loan, this quarter they seemed they\u2019ve head up [ph] really well and then you indicated the margins should remain under pressure here. Should we expect a similar pace of compression like you saw this quarter about the 3 to 4 basis point range? Steve Steinour : Yes, John. So we\u2019re very deliberately focused on making sure that we appraise loans appropriately, so we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we go through the right process internally and maximize pricing on both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. That\u2019s really helping; I think the margin performance is some of the stability that you\u2019re seeing. We will continue to see the pressure going forward. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent in talking about 2 to 4 basis points. Some of the longer term debts that we are putting on the balance sheet at this point to fund 2016 growth and related to some of the rating agency changes will increase the margin or increase the funding cost on the margin. So I think the higher end of the range is probably what I would think about for the fourth quarter but again I think managing the margin for consistent stable performance. John Pancari : Okay, all right. Thank you. And then certainly I guess I was going to hop over to capital, just wanted to ask you about your updated thoughts on deployment priorities when it comes to the buyback, dividend and also in - importantly on M&A and if there\u2019s been any change to those priorities given the stubborn interest environment. Thanks. Steve Steinour : Yeah, our priorities have remained consistent with everything we\u2019ve disclosed historically. We\u2019re of course focused on the dividend and return of capital to our shareholders, organic growth and - but the buyback I think, certainly if Macquarie or Huntington Technology Finances agreed, example of the type of acquisition that we think is very advantageous for our shareholders performing better than we expected and when you think about it from an acquisition like Macquarie versus the share repurchase, I would do an acquisition like Macquarie any day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, this is Martin Turskin [ph] for Bob Ramsey. Steve Steinour : Hi, Martin. Unidentified Analyst : I had a question, so auto loans were up almost 800 million in the quarter and there was - this morning was a general article about OCC Director Cary [ph] being concerned about the activity in the market, are you seeing anything that concerns you? Dan Neumeyer : Yeah, Martin, this is Dan Neumeyer. No and industry wide I think his observations are spot on but we have said repeatedly when you look at our strategy on auto loans we\u2019ve been very consistent. Our numbers are rock solid in terms of what\u2019s originating [indiscernible], LTBs, the term of our loans, there is no risk layering within our portfolio, so we feel extremely confident in the performance of our book today. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Steve Steinour : Martin, this is a sort of industry I think of the control or the control of credit is done the industry and investors of service, pointing out where they have concerns, let\u2019s issues get addressed so we don\u2019t - as Dan said, we\u2019re in great shape, we don\u2019t see us sitting with any concerns right now but obviously they must be existing at that subprime space. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you. And then moving on to plant [ph] sale of Huntington asset division advisors, what do you expect to be the impact on revenues and expenses and what\u2019s the timing in the sale? Steve Steinour : It will basically have a non-material impact on revenue and expense and it will take place in the fourth quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you very much. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you, good morning. Dan Neumeyer : Hi, Bill. Bill Carcache : Hi, you guys talked about your commitment to achieving positive operating leverage and pacing your investments to make that happen. Can you walk through for us your tucking order of investment opportunities and perhaps give a little bit of color around whether those investment opportunities are revenue generating versus compliance related, just to give us a flavor of what some of those opportunities are? Dan Neumeyer : Yeah, so the opportunities that we\u2019re looking at are very consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing over the last two or three years and we are investing in distribution. You\u2019ve seen us bring online a number of in-store branches which we think are going to be very advantageous for us in the future in terms of optimizing the cost of distribution. Our customers are migrating to those branches for their transactions and we actually sell very, very well in those facilities. So that clearly has been one area. Investments in technology has been another significant area for us. You\u2019ve seen us do a number of things with image enabled [ph] ATMs with new teller platform, with our deposit image [ph] capabilities on mobile phones and we make - continue to make strong investments in the digital capabilities that we need to go forward. So these are the types of investments that we are making and we continue to make and as it relates to positive operating leverage in 2016, we\u2019re going to make these investments as appropriate, we\u2019re going to manage the expense base based upon the revenue environment. Steve mentioned that we are budgeting 2016 assuming an unchanged rate scenario, which means that we\u2019re going into the year with a very conservative expense outlook based upon an unchanged rate scenario. So again we\u2019re going to continue to manage for positive operating leverage on an annual basis and we\u2019re going to do that by making sure that we manage the expense based upon the revenue environment that we\u2019re in, so very confident that we\u2019re going to be able to achieve that in 2016. Bill Carcache : It\u2019s helpful, thank you. Circling back on auto, can you talk about what\u2019s happening with your participation within auto and speak to any changes and practices that you\u2019re seeing? Yes, at the industry level as well as potentially how those could impact Huntington? I\u2019m really just trying to, I guess assess the risk of disruption to the flow of auto loans that you get from your dealer relationships? Dan Neumeyer : Yeah, this is Dan again. We don\u2019t expect any disruption, we have a niche that we play on which is prime and super prime - we have great dealer relationships that\u2019s been established by Nick [ inaudible 0 :31:32]and his team over a long period of time, so while there may be disruption in the industry as a whole, we really think that we have a value proposition that we\u2019ve been very consistent. We know what our target market is and we really don\u2019t expect any disruption to that. Steve Steinour : Last time there were disruptions was \u201809 and \u201810 and we used it as an opportunity to expand. We\u2019ve been in the business for 60 plus years and we got multi-generational relationships particularly in our corporate brand. So we feel very bullish about the business. Bill Carcache : So the flow of auto loans that you guys get from your dealer relationships aren\u2019t really a function of dealer participation or be more function of the long-term relationships that you\u2019ve had? Steve Steinour : Yeah, I would say that\u2019s accurate. Our dealers know that they have a consistent source that has been there through every cycle and I think that dealer relationship is what drives the volumes. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s r very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, there. Thank you for taking the question. Following up on also and mark up[ inaudible 0 :32:47]. How do you expect the industry to evolve do you think over the next few years going to be going to the elimination mark ups, you mark ups just come down, do you think it\u2019s kind of different with different players. If you could kind of think a few years out, what do you think the industry is going to be? Steve Steinour : Geoff, the industry is trending towards a tighter range of pricing and we think a couple of years out it will be tighter but there will be a range, it won\u2019t be flat pricing. And we\u2019re basing that on the recent announcements with some banks and the safety B [ph] where those pricing discretion allowed and that discretion may be an important part of delivering sales to some segments of the market place and the population as a whole. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just to follow up, it looked like this quarter also was responsible for the bulk of increases in average loan balances. How do you see that changing over future quarters? When do you think the mix will shift away from also towards commercial and other categories driving loan growth? Steve Steinour : Geoff, it\u2019s really hard to say. I mean the - obviously the auto industry is very strong right now, record volumes and as we pointed out in our comments earlier, we\u2019ve had seven quarters of a billion dollars or more in production. So I think it comes down to - in this environment we think the way we run this business, the quality of our portfolio from risk return perspective this is a good asset to have on our balance sheet. So we\u2019re extremely comfortable with that. We certainly hope it continues long into 2016 and we think it will. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Huston from Jeffries. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, good morning. On the C&I side, you guys had been very clear about watching your growth and so you\u2019ve seen kind of a flatness over the last couple of quarters. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand what\u2019s happening on the HTF side, within that and then what other pockets of C&I are either growing or shrinking and how do you see that planning out forward? Dan Neumeyer : Yeah, Ken, this is Dan. The market remains competitive but we are seeing a nice growth in many of the segments, equipment finance continues to be a driver and Huntington Technology Finance as a part of that has macro [indiscernible] actually beating expectations, so we\u2019re happy with what\u2019s going on there. We had good growth in the quarter and in core middle markets, large corporate and our protocols continue to - each individual one is not huge but collectively healthcare franchise, AVL [ph] are all good contributors in the quarter. So it\u2019s really a matter of picking our slots and which ones align best with our risk appetite. Overall, our backlogs are actually quite healthy, a little bit better even than a year ago at this time. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and then on the credit side this is the first quarter we\u2019ve seen a provision build from you guys in quite a long time, I know you did have some recoveries in CRE but is this a flip over here, what are you guys seeing as far as the macro that\u2019s leading to that kind of decent delta from releasing to provisioning and should we expect builds going forward? Dan Neumeyer : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really. The numbers we\u2019re talking about are kind of smaller side. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any dramatic shift. We did over provide a bit this quarter. I think we\u2019ve been thinking for some time that the conversion of charge offs and provision would be more closely aligned and I think we continue - we\u2019ll continue to operate in that general range. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Steven Alexopoulos : Good morning everybody. Mac McCullough : Good morning. Mac McCullough : On the expenses, if I look at the year-to-date adjusted expenses of 1.4 billion and then I use your guidance for there\u2019s a [ph] consistent with the last two quarters for fourth quarter, that will imply somewhere around 1.9 billion adjusted for the year, which according to my math is 5.5% increase over the 2014 adjusted level of 1.8 billion. What am I missing there regarding to expenses in the 2% to 4% range? Steve Steinour : Yeah, so it comes down to the fact that we added Macquarie this year. So that guidance is excluding HTF. Steven Alexopoulos : The guidance is excluding that transaction. So what base should we be using for 2014 then with this 2% to 4% full year adjusted guidance? Mac McCullough : So it should be the 2014 adjusted and then 2015adjusted excluding HTF. The reason that we did that is because we gave this guidance originally before the HTF transaction and we just felt it was important to continue to give consistent guidance here. So that\u2019s the way to think about the math, that\u2019s the way it works. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, got you. Okay. Separately given such strong growth that you\u2019ve been having in auto are you guys planning for a securitization in the fourth quarter or may be just what\u2019s on timing for your next one? Mac McCullough : Yeah, we continue to look at kind of the efficiency of the securitization market and the need for us to actually that either from a risk concentration or funding perspective, we don\u2019t see a need to do that in the near future. We have talked about perhaps doing some funding transactions in 2016 but again we don\u2019t see that as being required at this point in time. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And Mac may be if I could just go back to the prior question I had, so what is the dollar of expenses assuming the numbers right that wish that were attributable to the deal that we should be excluding? Mac McCullough : So we gave guidance on that last quarter. Macquarie expenses were about $15 million a quarter and very consistent in terms of what we see in this quarter as well. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. Mac McCullough : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Okay, good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi, Ken. Ken Zerbe : Just take off with interest rates, yearly margin in particular, obviously we heard it should go down from here but when we think about sort of the new money rates that you are putting on new business versus portfolio rates, how far off are the two, right? Is it really asset yields coming down that\u2019s still causing all the pressure or is more the liability cost going up? And the reason I want to compare that to some of the other banks in the industry who\u2019ve been talking a lot more about NIM stability even in this environment? Thanks. Steve Steinour : So you know up until this point in time if it really has been on the asset side of the equation, so we still are seeing as new assets come on the balance sheet. They\u2019re actually replacing assets that are coming off at a higher yield. You know we\u2019re starting to see because of some of the debt issuance that we\u2019re doing a bit of a change of the liability side as well not significant. But I would tell you that we\u2019re probably pretty close to the assets life kind of neutralizing and I would think about maybe the second half of 2016 seeing some stabilization there. Unidentified Analyst : On total NIM or just the asset side? Steve Steinour : I would say probably both, given the current rate - given the current rate environment the current competitive environment lots of factors go into that of course but second half of \u201816 probably looks reasonable. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then second question I had, just on the swaps, are you guys planning to let those continue to runoff each quarter from here or just given sort of the low rate expectations about rate hikes, would you consider putting additional swaps on? Steve Steinour : No, we do evaluate that frequently and I would tell that right now we\u2019re comfortable with the current trajectory of how they are coming off. So again we spend a fair amount of time in ALCO, sub-ALCO reviewing the swap position and our overall asset liability position of course. And but I will stay that we\u2019re staying of course. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, what would have to happen to change your view on that in terms of rate expectations or is that something else? Steve Steinour : Yeah, I think - I think rate expectations length of still lay perhaps in seeing any changes coming out of the fed. I think we\u2019re just, just at a process the information that\u2019s available to us and make decisions on that. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, thank you very much. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : It\u2019s my first question, is just on credit quality, I did notice that on the auto side that both NPLs in auto and late stage delinquencies did go up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and I am wondering if that\u2019s just normal seasoning of that or there something else going on there? And relative to your normal range for charge offs overall 35 to 55 basis points, where do you think auto losses would normalize to relative to the 20ish basis points that we\u2019ve been seeing recently? Mac McCullough : Yeah, so Erika first of all I would say that you know when we get down the performance metrics we have today are very, very well so any change from quarter-to-quarter even year-over-year at this point you know a tick up might noticeable but it\u2019s still of a very low base. So I don\u2019t read anything into the any quarterly variance or year-over-year grants, but there is some seasonality and we do tend to be a little bit of an uptick in the third quarter and there might be a very small impact from some of the TCPA charges ability to call on customers therefore why was impacted but only very slightly, so that might be a part of it. But overall we\u2019re very pleased with these metrics. Obviously, overtime we could see an uptick in charge off as we move to the cycle, although we continue to originate very consistently. And so I think it would be in line with historical performance. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question is - a follow-up to John\u2019s question earlier. This quarter we saw headlines that Huntington was part of shooter, so to speak for a regional that would be a large portion of the bank. And given sort of your priority list in terms of capital allocation that you listed in terms of dividend buybacks and asset, is that in our part if the equation in terms of capital allocation in terms of buying a relatively lager deposit? Steve Steinour : You know Erika, we\u2019ve lost you, can\u2019t really hear the last part of the question. Erika Najarian : Oh, I am sorry, I don\u2019t know where I cutoff that, you know given that Huntington is boiled in rumor, so as it possible shooter for the large northeast depository, but relative to your priority list of capital allocation dividends, buybacks and asset purchases like Macquarie, should we eliminate Huntington as a potential shooter for large depository deals like that over the next year or two? Steve Steinour : So you know first we don\u2019t respond rumors in the marketplace, so that\u2019s the answer of on the specific question that you asked. But the way we think about acquisition is does not changed. We\u2019re extremely consistent; we\u2019ve been consistent before a number of years in terms of thinking about the fixed footprint. Core depository is looking in the contiguous states is something we talked about as well. So we\u2019ve been very consistent in how we talk about our M&A strategy. Erika Najarian : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samir Kafity [ph]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for talking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit about on the slops that you mentioned earlier, I might have missed it, but in terms of the outlook for the NIM going forward, what have you taken to your expectation as far as replacing that swap book as those mature because it seems like based on the benefit you\u2019ve been receiving from those as those slops mature on this, they were pleased if the negative impact on your margin and then to the extend you enter into a new swaps, you know could it be - possibility that those are maybe less economical than your current ones, so again that causes some downward impact on the NIM where you\u2019ve been. So if you could just help us kind of clarifying thing to the impact on the NIM from the reduction in your swap that would be helpful? Steve Steinour : Yeah, so the - the guidance that we\u2019ve given on our NIM historically and continue to give on our NIM assumes that we can change the assets swaps for loss, so there is no replacement in that work as we give guidance and think about the future. So again we\u2019ve been consistent in that approach and that guidance overtime. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you for the clarification. The other thing I was looking to just clarify also was in terms of again the dealer market issue, just kind of flush out a little bit in terms of settlements some of your peers have had with regulators, are you saying that you haven\u2019t needed to unsecured any sort of pricing changes or caps in terms of your relationships with the dealers given your focus on prime and super prime customers and therefore you don\u2019t see an impact or have you already unsecured those changes and still aren\u2019t seeing any impact on your business again because of the quality plus the account are going after? Just a clarify would be helpful. Steve Steinour : So I don\u2019t think that we are anticipating any changes from what was happening in the marketplace today. We\u2019ve made changes back in 2010 around the way we think about pricing and what we\u2019ve allowed the dealer to do. So we think that what we are doing today is very consistent with what we done sometime and that waiting time and don\u2019t see any issues there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just a quick one if I may, in terms of your digital investment, could you help us, how much you are planning to invest in 2016 and the used in vision also investing on the digital side not only on the - for consumer loans and consumer relate activities but also any potential opportunities to invest related to your commercial businesses? Thank you. Steve Steinour : So we don\u2019t really disclose the size of investment that we make in various aspects of the business from a technologic perspective. You know I will say that the investment they were making is broad across all segments and all lines of business and that we are accelerating that investment in digital. But again that\u2019s something that we don\u2019t disclose. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you for talking my questions. Steve Steinour : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby. Your line is open. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Steve I wanted to ask - Steve Steinour : Good morning. Marty Mosby : Well, yeah, same here. Steve Steinour : Okay. Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask you about the, when you look at the average customer relationships. As you are adding customers so quickly, but you are also being able to increase the pool that have six plus products, are you being able to just convert new customers with significant amount of products or is there just a wholesale change in the banker relationship and is that why you are being able to accomplish both those goals at the same time? Steve Steinour : Marty, we have invested in our brand and in our products to make them very attractive with unique, in some cases unique features. We talked in prior earnings releases about an investment we\u2019ve made last year in date and analytics and creating the capacity to better understand our customer base and their needs and desires and our capital to fulfill with them in different channels and the combination of those investments with our ongoing efforts to provide better sales execution is leading to growth in both new customers but growth in product penetration with the entire book. And we think we\u2019re - while we\u2019re better, we have opportunity to further improve. Marty Mosby : And it usually just takes a little time for the new customers to kind of rollup and add their relationships, so it\u2019s a very positive story to build you both at same time. And then Mac, I wanted to ask you about hedging in the mortgage banking unit. If you look at the volatility that you are getting just in the last you know two quarter, you had 6 million write-up, net write-up last quarter, you got a 8 million net write down this quarter. The volatility in your results is about 50% of your average mortgage banking revenue line, if you look Wells Fargo for incidence, their volatility is around 10%, is there any way that you can try to hedge out some of that volatility in the servicing portfolio with a change in interest rate? So just wanted to see if you had a philosophy that you all had or way to adopt maybe limit that volatility a little bit more? Mac McCullough : Yeah, Marty, we\u2019re taking to look at that. Obviously, I think the hedges are very efficient in last couple of quarters with just given some of the volatility and rate changes and kind of that market place. So we\u2019re talking to look at it, a strategy is there but we do feel confident in what we are doing. I just think the market has been a little, little volatile last few quarters. Marty Mosby : Okay, we could probably just talk offline a little bit about that because we have done in the past, so we could talk about few things, so we\u2019ve been able to do to help me on minimize some of that volatility. Steve Steinour : That\u2019s great. Thanks Marty. Marty Mosby : Alright, talk to you later. Thanks. Steve Steinour : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey. Your line is open. Bob Ramsey : Hi, just couple of question on fees. Given the mortgage, I am thinking weakness this quarter, could you give us some color around that and what\u2019s your outlook going forward? Steve Steinour : Yeah, so keep in mind that the MSR impairment that we mentioned earlier on the call is embedded in that mortgage banking line, so that\u2019s $8.4 million in the mortgage banking line, excluding that year-over-year, I think we\u2019re up $5 million in growth. So clearly we are seeing some reduction in volume relative to where we were earlier on the year, we do see revives like everyone else in the industry dropping off and purchases becoming more important, but I do think both the volumes are solid, but that as far as they weren\u2019t earlier in the year. Bob Ramsey : Got it. And service charges were up 5 million quarter, which kind of seems particularly strong and could you give me some color on what\u2019s driving that up? Mac McCullough : So this actually is the first quarter on a year-over-year basis where we no longer have the impact of changes that we made for fair play. Back in July of 2014 was the last adjustment that we made that actually impacted us by $6 million a quarter. So we\u2019re through that now and what you are actually seeing come true on that line is more reflective of the strength household growth that we\u2019ve able to drive really since we introduced fair play. So that I think I think is a very positive sign around the success of the strategy and what we would expect going forward. Bob Ramsey : Got it. Thank you very much. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Peter Winter : Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the new slides on the economic date. But just curious with the global slowdown, the strong dollar, have you guys seen any impact to your businesses or is it just so much new account that you are able to growth through that? Dan Neumeyer : Hey Peter, this is Dan. I would say that, yeah, we watch the dollar China commodity, but I think for our local economy, the strength of the auto industry, the strength of the housing market and the fact that low energy prices well that\u2019s a negative for the energy businesses for many of our customers, you know energy costs are major input and to our consumers. So I think those factors combined actually have been a net positive and we\u2019re still seeing strong demand and strong - pretty strong in our region. Peter Winter : Is that contracting, I know you talked about it, but is it having a little bit of an impact of the C&I side? Dan Neumeyer : You know I would say it\u2019s only epithetic, we\u2019re not seeing any trends in any industry. You know we\u2019re seeing you know case here and there of somebody being particularly affected but on the whole, we\u2019ve not seen any kind of industry level that impacts, we though at this point. Peter Winter : Got it. Thank you. Dan Neumeyer : Thanks Peter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr. Your line is open. Chris Spahr : Hi, good morning. I just have a question on deposit trends, I see that most accounts and the peers are down. I was wondering if we should read into that for the next few quarters? Mac McCullough : Hi Chris, see now, I don\u2019t think if there is anything you should really read into that. I think we continue to see very positive growth on both consumer households and on the commercial side of the business, you know some really good growth on the commercial side. So I really don\u2019t think there is anything you should read into that. Chris Spahr : Right, thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Steve Steinour : Okay, hearing no further questions. This is Steve, I want to just - Operator : Excuse me. We did have one more question from the David Darst from Guggenheim. Your line is open. David Darst : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi David. Mac McCullough : Good morning, David. David Darst : Thanks for including me. So I just wanted to ask about the HT of fee income and then I believe you got some operating leases with that portfolio as well, so should we see that the fee income contribution grow or is that going to betide overtime? Steve Steinour : Yeah, the operating lease income will betide overtime along with the operating lease expense. So we\u2019re not going to do operating leases going forward as we renew that business or bringing additional lease on and all end up in the margin going forward. So you will see both the income and the expense related operating leases are trying to come. David Darst : Okay, great, thanks a lot. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Any other questions, operator? Operator : There are not further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters. Steve Steinour : So we\u2019re pleased with our third quarter results. And our strategies are working, our investments are positively contributing to results and our execution is focused and strong. We continued to gain market share and improve share wallet. We produced 5% year-over-year revenue growth in a challenging environment and we\u2019ve remained focused on pricing and underwriting discipline. We continued to invest in our businesses but we pace those investments to assure positive operating leverage. We continued to work toward out long term corporate goals including becoming more efficient and boosting returns. And finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long term shareholders. Our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility, achieving positive operating leverage and driving solid, consistent long term performance. We are well aligned on these priorities. So thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares\u2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Mark Muth : Thank you, Chris. Welcome, I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for rebroadcast starting about an hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, our Chief Financial Officer; Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. As noted on Slide 1, today\u2019s discussion including the Q&A period will contain forward-looking statements such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 2 into and an overview of the financials. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Mark. And good morning and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington. We have great results to share with you today and we are very pleased with how we are positioned for 2016. For the past six years, Huntington\u2019s customer-centric strategy has resulted in growth in market share and in share of wallet through execution of our distinctive fair play philosophy, our welcome culture, and our superior customer service. 2015 was a year of continued disciplined execution of this strategy, producing solid results and delivering on our commitments to our customers, colleagues, communities and most importantly to our shareholders. We continue to invest in our colleagues and in the capabilities we need to continue to be an industry leader in customer experience, including digital, data analytics and cyber security. We also continue to optimize our custom-centric distribution strategy, including the accelerated buildout about in-store strategy in Michigan. In addition in 2015, we returned approximately $400 million of capital or more than 55% of net income to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Slide 2 shows some of the financial highlights for the year. Earnings per common share of $0.81, was up 13% from 2014, while tangible book value per share increased 4% to $6.91. Full year return on tangible common equity was 12.4%, which was modestly below our long-term financial goal of 13% to 15%. Return on assets was $1.01 for the full year. We are very pleased with our core fundamentals for the full year including revenue growth of 6%, average loan growth of 7% and average core deposit growth of 9%, and we delivered a positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year. Slide 3 shows some of the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.21, was up 11% year-over-year. Fourth quarter return on tangible common equity was 12.4% while fourth quarter return on assets was 1%. We again produced solid revenue growth despite the challenging interest rate environments. Year-over-year revenue growth was 9%, with both the net interest income and noninterest income contributing to the increase. We were particularly pleased with the 17% year-over-year increase in noninterest income in the fourth quarter, benefiting from performance in Capital Markets, mortgage banking, and SBA loans sales among others. Expense growth was well controlled with non interest expense up only 3% year-over-year. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.7%, a 250-basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. High quality balance sheet growth included 8% year-over-year increase in average core deposits and a 6% increase in average loans and leases. Growth in average core deposits more than fully funded average loan growth. As we noted the past several quarters while the value of core deposits may not be fully appreciated, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will prove to be a key differentiator in a rising rate environment. We remain pleased with our credit quality, with only 18 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and 79 basis points of non performing assets. Our capital ratios remain strong as well. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.81%, while common equity Tier 1 was 9.80%. Slide 4, provides a summary of the income statement, including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, total reported revenue increased 9% to $778 million. Spread revenues accounted for less than half of the increase as net interest income increased 5% to $505 million. We benefitted from 8% average earning asset growth partially offset by nine basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by mixshift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably the increase in low yielding LCR compliance securities in our earning assets, and higher costs senior bank notes in our funding mix. We continue to remain disciplined in pricing of both loans and deposits. During the 2015 fourth quarter, Congress passed a provision in fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act, more commonly referred to as the highway bill, which reduced and capped dividends paid by The Federal Reserve to banks with assets greater than $10 billion including Huntington. The reduction in this dividend is expected to negatively impact net interest income by approximately $7 million in 2016. We were pleased with our fee income performance in the quarter, as more than 60% of the year-over-year revenue increase came from noninterest income. Specifically, reported noninterest income was $272 million, an increase of $39 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter. Highlights included an 8% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and continued momentum in card and payment processing income. Mortgage banking income increased 124% from year-ago quarter as a result of an $11 million increase in mortgage origination and secondary marketing revenues, coupled with a $5 million increase from the MSR hedging-related activities. Other income included a $3 million gain on the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services, which was included in the quarter\u2019s merger and acquisition-related significant item. The decision to sell these non-core businesses allow us to focus on the core wealth business and continue to reposition the Regional Banking and Huntington Private Client Group segment for better growth and returns in coming quarters. The sale was expected to reduce noninterest income by approximately $14 million in 2016 primarily in the trust services line and reduce noninterest expense by approximately $22 million in 2016, primarily in the personal expense line. Reported noninterest expense in the 2015 fourth quarter was $499 million, an increase of $15 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. This quarter\u2019s noninterest expense included two significant items, $8 million of franchise repositioning expense related to branch closures, facilities impairments, and personnel actions, and $3 million of merger-related expense from Huntington Technology Finance acquisition and the previously mentioned sale of Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Services. Noninterest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $25 million or 5% year-over-year. Of this increase approximately $14 million was related to the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we have re branded in Huntington Technology Finance. During the fourth quarter the FDIC announced the surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion including Huntington. We expect the surcharge will negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million 2016. Turning to Slide 5, average loans and leases increased $2.7 billion or 6% year-over-year as we again experienced year-over-year growth in every portfolio. Average securities increased $2.1 billion or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR compliance securities into a lesser extent growth in direct purchase municipal securities originated by our commercial segment. Average commercial and industrial loans grew 1.3 billion or 7%, primarily driven by a 1.1 billion increase in asset finance, 0.8 billion of which came via the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. The quarter also benefited from seasonal strength in auto floor plan lending and growth in corporate lending, while core middle business banking saw modest portfolio reductions. Average automobile loans, grew $1.8 billion or 9% from the year ago quarter. The 2015 fourth quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of more than one billion of auto loan originations. Auto finance remains a core competency of Huntington and is detailed on the slides in the appendix, we have remained consistent in our strategy which is built around a dealer-centric model and focused on prime borrowers. Our underwriting has not changed, in fact while our industry volumes were up around 5% to 6% in 2015, our origination volumes were essentially flat reflecting our lending discipline. Yields on new auto paper dipped slightly in the fourth quarter to the 290 to 295 range, just above the 3% in the prior quarter. We also saw the normal seasonal shift to new car sales in the quarter resulting in a mix shift reduction in the overall yield. We expect the new used mix will return to more normal levels in the first quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide and the right side of balance sheet, average total deposits increased $4.6 billion or 9% over the year-ago quarter, including a $3.9 billion or 8% increase in average core deposits. Average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $ 2billion or 13% year-over-year and average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $1 billion or 16%. These growth numbers reflect our continued focus on new customer checking households and commercial relationship account acquisition. Average money market deposits increased $1.4 billion or 8% year-over-year, reflecting our continued efforts to deepen banking relationships and increased share of wallet. We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 21% year-over-year. As shown on Slide 5, average total demand deposits accounted for 38% of non-equity funding in 2015 fourth quarter, while money market deposits accounted for 31%. By contrast, average score CDs accounted for only 4% of our non-equity funding in the quarter. As we have highlighted in the last few quarters, the year-over-year growth in our total core deposits more than fully funded our average loan growth over this period. Average long-term debt increased $2.9 billion or 72% as a result of four bank-level senior debt issuances this year, totalling $3.1 billion including $850 million issued in November, as well as the assumption of $500 million of debt in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. These long-term debt issuances allowed us to reduce average short-term borrowings by $2.2 billion or 80% from the year-ago quarter. While this trade had a negative impact on the net interest margin, the long-term debt provides us with advantages of long-term stable funding. Average broker deposits increased $500 million, we continue to view wholesale funding sources as a cost efficient means for funding balance sheet growth including LCR-related securities growth, while managing core deposit expense and maintaining sales focus on acquiring core checking account customers. Slide 6 shows our net interest margin deposit against earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs. Fourth quarter NIM decreased nine basis points year-over-year and seven basis points linked quarter to 3.09%. Recall that the third quarter of 2015, net interest margin benefitted from approximately two basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial portfolio. We continue to experience pricing pressure across most asset classes, though the majority of the compression reflected unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet most notably the growth in LCR compliance securities funded by senior bank debt issuance. While we were encouraged by the December interest rate increase by the FOMC, the impact on the fourth quarter\u2019s net interest margin was negligible. Going forward we expect modest net interest margin pressure to remain a headwind as several asset classes continue to price lower given average portfolio rates above new money rates. Despite the recent increases in LIBOR and prime. Based on our current outlook, we remain comfortable reaffirming that the net interest margin will remain above 3% in 2016. Slide 7 provides an update on our assets sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. We continue to have a relatively neutral balance sheet largely due to our swap portfolio. As shown on the chart on the top, our modeling estimates that net interest income would benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve, unchanged from a quarter ago. In a hypothetical scenario, without the $8.5 billion of asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 3.4% in the up 200 basis point ramp scenario. The chart at the bottom of the slide shows our $8.5 billion asset swap portfolio and the $5.9 billion liability swap portfolio, including the respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefits of swaps was $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, up from $28 million in the 2015 thirty quarter and $24 million in the year ago quarter. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. And during the 2015 fourth quarter 800 million of the asset swaps matured. As we communicated a few quarters ago we intend to allow maturing asset swaps this year to run off, gradually shifting our balance sheet positioning more asset sensitive. As of year end, 3.6 billion of swaps were scheduled to mature of the next 12 months. Slide 8 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our risk-based regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the prior quarter end, while tangible common equity or TCE decline slightly. We repurchased $2.35 million common shares during the fourth quarter at an average price of $11.59 per share, and a total of 23 million common shares on average price of $10.93 over the full year. Coupled with cash dividends we effectively returned approximately $400 million of capital to shareholders during 2015. We have 166 million of authorized repurchase capacity remaining for the final two quarters under our 366 million share repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectations. The loan loss provision was $36.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $21.8 million of net charge offs. Net charge offs remained well-controlled at only 18 basis points, or well below our long term expectations of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Net charge offs for the full year were also 18 basis points. The ACL ratio ticked up one basis point to 1.33% of loans and leases, compared to 1.32% at the end of the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans eased to 180% compared to 184% a quarter ago, due to a slight uptick in NALs. We believe the allowances are appropriate and request the underline credit quality of our loan portfolio. Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart on the upper left shows a slight increase in the non-performing asset ratio for the quarter to 79 basis points compared to 77 basis points a quarter ago. The increase primarily reflected two oil and gas exploration and production credits, which were placed on nonaccrual during the quarter. The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remain flat from a quarter ago. The bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio which also remains unchanged. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans of 29 basis points in fourth quarter again unchanged from the prior quarter. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Mac. Our fair play banking philosophy, our welcome culture, and our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus continues to drive, we believe to be industry-leading customer acquisitions. Slide 11 illustrates these long-term trends in consumer and commercial customer acquisition. We\u2019ve increased our consumer checking households and our business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compounded annual growth rates since 2010. While the law of large numbers might be beginning to weigh on these growth rates, the underlying customer growth rates remain impressive. And these robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the two lower charts on the slide. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the recent trend visible in the chart on the bottom left as the past three quarters have shown improved momentum in the consumer household revenue metrics as we\u2019ve lapped the last fee change we implemented under our fair play philosophy and continued to realize the benefit of the underlying customer growth. You\u2019ve heard me say this before but our focus remains on growing revenues. We will continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment. Although the slides have been slightly redesigned from what you are used to seeing Slide 12 and Slide 13 illustrate the continued success of OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. As we\u2019ve stated before our strategy is not about gaining market share \u2013 our strategy is about gaining market share and share of wallet. Now this strategy is built around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers, knowing that this will translate both into more loyal stickier customers, as well as revenue growth. As of year-end, almost 52 % of our consumers checking households use six or more products and services and that\u2019s up from 49% a year-ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similarly, 44% of our commercial customers used four or more product or services at year end, up from 42% a year-ago. Again, this has translated directly to revenue growth, as commercial revenue increased 4% year-over-year. We introduced the next two slides to you last quarter and many of you indicated how helpful you found them. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rate across our six core Midwestern states, as well as other leading coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trend in the unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Despite the recent volatility exhibited in the equity and commodity markets, we remain bullish on our core Midwestern footprint. Our small and medium-sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses and while consumers continue to benefit from recovering real estate markets, low energy prices and early signs of wage inflation in certain markets, such as here in Columbus. The auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016. Other industries that contribute meaningfully to the regional economy, such as healthcare, medical devices, medical technology and higher education amongst others, also remain strong. Our small business customers continue to experience strong performance and improving balance sheet. Our SBA lending also remains quite robust. I find the chart in the lower right on slide 14 particularly encouraging. This chart shows the state-leading economic indices as reported by The Federal Reserve bank of Philadelphia for our six-state footprint, all of which are projected to be positive over the next six months. The chart on the bottom left of Slide 14 shows that unemployment rates in our footprint states continue to trend positively, including recent improvement in West Virginia, following several challenging months as they doubt the impact of lower coal prices. Unemployment rates in most of our footprint states remain in line with or better than the national average. The chart on the bottom of the Slide 15 shows a similar trend for our 10 largest deposit markets, which collectively account for more than 80% of our total deposit franchise. As detailed in the chart, the majority of these markets continue to trend favorably and seven of the 10 markets currently enjoy unemployment rates below the national average, and this is quite a departure from several years ago when most of these markets were above the national average. In 2014, we introduced long-term financial goals, including positive operating leverage annually. Slide 16 shows that we\u2019ve delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage in 2015, our third consecutive year to achieve this goal. Further, we also delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage both including and excluding the highly accretive Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. Over the course of the past year, some of you expressed concern about our ability to deliver this commitment in 2015, and while others have questioned the prudence of such a commitment even in the first place. So therefore, rather than taking a victory lap or dwelling too much on the accomplishment, I think it\u2019s important to reflect back both on the impetus for establishing annual positive operating leverage as one of our long-term financial goals, and why it\u2019s made us a better company. Just a few years ago, some shareholders questioned our spending discipline as we invest in the future, while the related revenue growth was often difficult to ascertain because continued refinements of our fair play philosophy masked the underlying momentum and ultimate return on those investments was not always easily enough quantified. But we continue to invest thoughtfully, strategically and opportunitistically for the future. However, we committed to our owners that we would better pace our investments with revenue growth and improved transparency. You can now see the fruit of these commitments in our daily culture at Huntington, a culture in which continuous improvement, a focus on driving sustained revenue growth and accountability for every dollar of investment has been established as an absolute expectation. We\u2019ve developed a culture in which our share owners should expect more often than not that we will deliver positive operating leverage as we constantly strive to post improved returns and top tier performance. With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 17 for some closing remarks and our initial 2016 expectations. We continue to manage the company with a focus on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long-term, and maintaining our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile throughout. We successfully build a strong, distinguished consumer brand, differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and to adapt or adjust to our environment where necessary. We completed and integrated the highly accretive acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which we rebranded Huntington Technology Finance, or HTF. Other past investments also continue to pay off. Such as our data analytics effort, which will drive better customer targeting and ongoing efforts to improve sales execution across the franchise and grow revenue. None of our investments are mature. We also continue to invest in enhanced sales management, digital technology, further investments in data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network, all of which will help drive future performance. The early anedoctal evidence from the buildout of our Meyer in-store strategy in the back half of 2015 is very positive, pointing towards a faster ramp than in prior in-store branch openings. We\u2019ve refined our in-store execution over the past several years to drive this improved performance and these new stores represented some of best locations, which were therefore also naturally lend themselves to stronger results. We remain bullish on the economic vitality and economic outlook of our core Midwest footprint, while we\u2019re prudently monitoring certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by global macroeconomic development such as oil and gas exploration and production. We believe these risks remain well contained within our portfolio and the majority of our core consumer, and small-medium-size businesses and customers enjoy a positive near-term outlook. Customer sentiment also remains positive. Commercial loan utilization rates showed a slight increase for the third consecutive quarter and loan pipelines are steady. Competitive pressures across our businesses show signs of stabilizing and while our commitment to be disciplined lenders has not wavered. 2016, our commercial teams will be refocusing on our core middle market and small business customers, following the recent year\u2019s focus on building out our specialty lending verticals. Our commitment to consumers remains constant. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our 2015 results and are optimistic as we enter 2016. Just as we did last year, we built our 2016 budget, assuming no benefit from interest rates and have established contingency plans, should an even more challenging environment materialize. We control our own destiny and once again, our focus and execution will deliver for our shareholders in 2016. While we expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind in the near term, we expect to grow revenue despite the pressure. That said, we continue to expect the NIM will bottom out later this year, assuming no interest rate increase and will remain above 3%. And further, we expect to grow both net interest income and noninterest income. We expect 2016 full-year revenue growth will be consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and net MSR activity. As you should have come to expect from us, we will continue to invest in our businesses, but we\u2019ll pace those investments, consistent with our revenue outlook. The bulk of these investments will remain focused in technology, including data analytics, digital and mobile, and improved sales execution. We continue to manage our loan portfolio closely, particularly sectors in specific relationships most likely to be affected by recent market volatility, the strengthening dollar, declining commodity values, and other macroeconomic factors. I\u2019m incrementally more concerned today about our credit outlook than I was when we spoke a quarter ago, but I stress that we do not see significant deterioration on the near-term horizon. Given the absolute low level of our credit metrics, recent global economic volatility and the strength of the dollar, we expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward and anticipate that loan loss provisioning for both ourselves and the broader industry will likely begin to increase sometime in 2016. On the other hand, we expect our net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Finally, I always like to close with a reminder that there\u2019s a high level of alignment between the board and management and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We\u2019re highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders capital. So now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark so we can begin the Q&A. Mark Muth : Thanks Steve. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up, and then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Houston of Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Houston : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve Steinour : Hi, Ken. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Ken. Ken Houston : Steve, if I could ask you to talk a little bit more about your comment about credits. This quarter obviously you put up a bigger reserve than we had seen in a while and you mentioned a couple specific things. Charge-offs, however, are just remarkably low. So just in terms of the outlook, how \u2013 can you talk to us just about where you\u2019d expect that volatility to start to come from, and should we also expect you to continue to have to start building reserves going forward? And why would that be the case? Thanks. Dan Neumeyer : Hey Ken, this is Dan. Actually, the outlook is very strong and we feel very good about charge-offs entering into 2016. The one area that we\u2019ve seen some volatility in is kind of the whole commodities and oil and gas arena. To remind you, we have very modest exposure there. Where all the volatility has been is in the ENP space we have less that, we have 0.5% of our total loan in that area, although we did build reserves this quarter based on that book, the majority of the provision increase was aligned with that very small portfolio because we know there\u2019s a lot of volatility and we want to continue to take a conservative stance. In terms of the charge-off outlook, I expect to remain below our long-term stated range. Mac McCullough : And Ken, I think the other thing is we\u2019ve had remarkable recoveries on CRE and we won\u2019t see that continuing into 2016, so we would naturally see some increase in charge-offs there. Ken Houston : Yes, okay. So just to play that forward just one more, so then how do we think about if you\u2019re really confident about the loss forecast, and this was a specific reserve action, then should we anticipate you needing to build reserves incrementally, or is this more just about charge-off normalization to both of your points? Dan Neumeyer : Since we\u2019ve been at these very low levels, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to move towards normalization. And I guess that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the same comment I would have, is we\u2019ve been at a historical lows with change in the cycle and with the loan growth. Yes, I think you will see some level of reserve build. This quarter was probably a little bit more pronounced because we did have a particular focus on our small ENP book. Ken Houston : Understood. Thanks, guys. Mac McCullough : So Ken, clearly, below our long-term range of 35 to 55. We\u2019ll probably see some increase towards that range, but we\u2019ll definitely be below it. Ken Houston : Yes. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Moss : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Steve Moss actually for John here. Mac McCullough : Hi, Steve. Steve Moss : On credit one more time, with regard to the inflows you had this quarter on criticized assets and commercial loans, how much of that was tied to commodities? Mac McCullough : Well, the majority of the increase in the nonaccrual loans were \u2013 as we said, we moved two reserve base loans to nonaccrual. The criticized category was actually much more stable. There was a very slight uptick in that category, but that obviously would be included in the NALs. Steve Moss : Okay. And then turning to, on the commercial loan yield side, commercial loan yields declined 10 basis points here during the quarter. Just wondering, where is the new money yields versus the fourth quarter book yield on the commercial loan book? Mac McCullough : You know, Steve, it\u2019s going to be mixed across the portfolio and I would tell you that we continue to see the same demand that we have seen historically in terms of the, our customers wanting to borrow. It\u2019s just a matter of us being more disciplined and making sure that we bring onto the balance sheet what we feel comfortable with. Clearly, we still see pressure on pricing, maybe less pressure on structure, but still some pressure on structure. And we\u2019re just being disciplined in terms of what we do. Steve Moss : Okay. And I guess to follow that up on the liability side, just wondering, you know, are we nearing a plateau on the increase in total interest bearing liabilities, or should that trend continue? Mac McCullough : Well, we\u2019ve done a great job of growing households and commercial operating accounts. And we\u2019re going to continue to see that, I believe, because of the, the philosophy we have around customer service, our fair play strategy. So I would expect that we\u2019re going to continue to grow households and we\u2019ll still see good noninterest bearing growth along with that. Steve Moss : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler, O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Two questions on overall loan growth. You guys give a lot of color on what\u2019s going on in the markets. I expect I know the answer to the first one, but Steve, if you can offer any additional thoughts on just any changes you\u2019re seeing in overall loan demand within the footprint. And then specifically I was hoping you guys could update us as well on your thoughts on your appetite for auto production, whether it\u2019s given pricing concerns or just any other pressures, perhaps building in the market. Steve Steinour : Scott, happy to try and answer on the first part. From what we can tell, and we\u2019ve talked to businesses in all of our markets over the last couple of weeks in particular, through multiple channels. And there\u2019s generally a bullishness. And you see that reflected in some of the economic statistics we\u2019ve provided you. But when you take it down to the customer level, it\u2019s very positive, very encouraging. So we\u2019re \u2013 and our pipelines would reflect that. We have a good pipeline for this time of year on the commercial side. And your second question, Scott, was? Scott Siefers : Appetite for auto production, just any changes, if it\u2019s decrease due to pricing pressures or maybe any other emerging pressures, still feeling very good about that space. Steve Steinour : I think the team has done a pretty good job. We essentially were flat year-over-year with origination and that reflected efforts to maintain yield. More recently, we\u2019ve been able to increase the yield on new production. So we\u2019re back above the 3% level. Scott Siefers : Okay, Steve Steinour : We like the asset class. There\u2019s no change in outlook for it. We just remain very disciplined in it. You get to see that discipline as we release it every quarter in terms of the different credit and other metrics. Scott Siefers : Okay. Great. Thank you guys very much. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR. Your line is open. Bob Ramsey : Hi, good morning. I was just curious, how much of the provision this quarter was specific to those two energy credits that you highlighted? Mac McCullough : $10 million Bob Ramsey : I\u2019m sorry? I didn\u2019t quite catch that. Did you say $9 million? Mac McCullough : It was $10 million. That applied not just to the two credits, but that was our reserve base loan portfolio in total, we added $10 million. So we now have a 6% reserve on our reserve base lending portfolio. Bob Ramsey : Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And are these \u2013 are any of the loans in that portfolio snicks, or are these, I guess, more direct lending relationships? Mac McCullough : No. Actually, our strategies are all, pretty much all tier national credit. Our target is larger well capitalized firms that have generally had access to the capital markets, have sophisticated hedging strategies, et cetera. So this is largely a tier national credit book. Bob Ramsey : Got it. Mac McCullough : We have no oilfield services either, as a reminder. Bob Ramsey : Perfect. All first lien, I take it? Mac McCullough : Yes Bob Ramsey : All right. Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Darst of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. David Darst : Hi, good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi, David David Darst : I guess with the swaps that are rolling off this year, that would be about eight basis points to your commercial yield. I guess is that the key driver behind some of the margin compression, or is there anything you can do to offset that? Or would it be volume? Mac McCullough : Yes. David, it\u2019s certainly a component of pressure to the margin. I would tell you that a good portion of it continues to be LCR and how we\u2019re funding LCR with wholesale funds. But, you know, this is all built into our plan around the expectations for 2016. So we\u2019re comfortable with that guidance of staying at 3% or above in 2016. And again, we\u2019re letting these swaps roll off so we can become more asset sensitive over time and we feel very comfortable with that strategy. David Darst : Okay, and if you had another 25 basis points midyear, would that give you enough to stabilize the core commercial yields, ex swaps. Mac McCullough : I\u2019m not sure about the commercial, but I think across the entire portfolio, another 25 basis points would certainly give us some relief from that pressure. David Darst : Okay, great. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello again. Another question on credit, what are the sorts of early indicators that you typically look at to see whether the cycle might be turning? Mac McCullough : Well, obviously we look at delinquencies and all the kind of traditional measurements. But as we\u2019re kind of even a step beyond that as we\u2019re talking to our customers and looking for the signals that did obviously, we\u2019re looking at job formation and interest rates and, you know, and the manufacturing base within our footprint, which continues to be strong. But in terms of the metrics, we try to look at the, you know, the early indicators, which are downgrades within the portfolio, including credit migration within the pass rated loan category and delinquencies are the primary measures. But again, before we even get to that point, we\u2019re trying to stay in touch with our customers and look at the key indicators that they are watching. And as Steve indicated earlier, right now in our region, the indicators are actually quite positive. Geoffrey Elliott : So I guess to follow-up how should we reconcile the indicators being quite positive with the message that you are kind of incrementally more cautious on credit as we go through 2016 for Huntington and for the industry? Mac McCullough : Well, I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there right now. And that is \u2013 we always take a conservative stance. If we have questions in the economy, we\u2019re going to \u2013 going to take a more cautious approach. But I would say that there\u2019s a Stark contrast today between what you see in the news and the way our customers and then folks in our region are feeling. But nonetheless, we are paying attention to the warning signs and clearly, you know, the energy and commodities businesses are quite volatile and that goes into our thinking. Steve Steinour : And I think that\u2019s the key, right? Because we\u2019re at a very low level in terms of charge-offs and nonperforming assets and we will see more volatility in 2016. So off of this low level is it likely that we see a trend towards the upside that\u2019s likely? We\u2019re very comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thanks. because if we continue to manage this risk profile with an aggregate, moderate to low position and we\u2019re coming off of a very severe cycle with absolute lows. So, we\u2019re not overly concerned about it. In fact, we like the \u2013 we very much like the geography we\u2019re in and what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Stapp of Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open. Andy Stapp : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi, Andy. Mac McCullough : Hi, Andy. Andy Stapp : All of my questions have been answered, but I just want to make sure you said you have no exposure to oilfield service companies? Steve Steinour : That\u2019s correct. It would be negligible. There would probably be a couple of small deals out there that you could classify as oilfield services, but we have \u2013 as a strategy, we have specifically avoided that and within our energy vertical, we have zero exposure. Andy Stapp : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. John Arfstrom : Thanks. Good morning guys. Steve Steinour : Hi, John. John Arfstrom : Mac, a question for you on your guidance. It\u2019s a bit of a propeller head question, but I\u2019ll ask it this way. This 3%, keeping the margin above 3%, are you talking about end of the year or full-year average for that? Mac McCullough : I would say both, John. John Arfstrom : Okay, hopeful. And then the other part is on the buyback, you have a tremendous amount of room left, given your share price, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the buyback versus other uses of capital. Thanks? Mac McCullough : Yes. So we did slow the buyback down as the quarter progressed, wanted to keep our powder dry. We fully intend to use the remainder of the buyback over the next two quarters. And we\u2019ve talked about how we use capital in terms of supporting the core growth and supporting the dividend. And after that comes share buybacks and M&A activity. But obviously at this price, we like our \u2013 we like the price very well. John Arfstrom : And do you plan to exhaust it, Mac? Or is this \u2013 is that just too big of a bite? Mac McCullough : Obviously, it will depend on market conditions and where we go from here, but, certainly that is possible for us to use the entire authorization. John Arfstrom : Okay, thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, John. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens. Your line is open. Terry McEvoy : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi, Terry. Mac McCullough : Hi, Terry. Terry McEvoy : Hi. Just \u2013 first question, service charges on deposit accounts, it was nice to see that 8% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter and up positive, I believe, for 2015. Looking ahead with no regulatory changes at all on fees, do you think the growth in that revenue line should be at or above the piece of new checking account or deposit relationship growth in the deposit base? Mac McCullough : Terry, there are two components in that line, right. There\u2019s the commercial, the treasury management revenue and then there\u2019s the retail side. Keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, we made our last fair play adjustment of $6 million. So you\u2019re seeing the first full quarter of kind of year-over-year growth off of the consumer side of the business reflecting the great job we do in bringing new households to the bank. And also tell you that treasury management had a great year in terms of product capability, penetrating the customer base, and fee growth. So, you know, certainly encouraged by what we see this quarter and definitely expect the trends to remain intact, especially relative to what you saw previous to this quarter. Terry McEvoy : And then just a follow-up question for Steve. You talked about contingency plans, should the revenue growth in 2016 not attractive your kind of outlook that you discussed today. Could you just shed a little bit of light on, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s on the expense side, where you see some opportunities if that does happen to be the case this year. Steve Steinour : Well, we continue to invest in the business. That\u2019s part of the plan. We\u2019ve been investing every year. We pace that investment and taper it off. And then there are other categories of expenses that that we would look to and some of that would be some of the business expansion in terms of people and related. Certainly, if we didn\u2019t see the revenue, the incentives and commissions would be adjusted. I think we may adjust some of our discretionary investments in a number of areas that we routinely want to look at. An example might be marketing. So hopefully that gives you \u2013 there is a smorgasbord that we\u2019re working with. We do this routinely. It\u2019s part of what we deliver to our board. If for some reason the economy starts changing, then we have a series of levels of contingent adjustments. Terry McEvoy : Thank you, both. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Terry. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Peter Winter : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi, Peter. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : Mac, I just want to go back to the comment, the wanting to keep the powder dry. Can you just talk about the M&A environment right now and also, can you talk about what your financial parameters are for a bank acquisition? Mac McCullough : So we\u2019re obviously always looking for acquisitions. I think we\u2019ve been very consistent in how we talk about it. I would say for us, there\u2019s really no change in terms of activity. We look at core banking franchises. We look at opportunities like MacQuarie that we had this year and continue to look into six to eight-footprint contiguous states. So I say, Peter, there\u2019s really no change in how we see the environment or really how we approach the environment. Peter Winter : Have you seen an increase in maybe willingness of sellers, given what\u2019s been going on recently in the lower for longer kind of rate environment? Mac McCullough : It\u2019s probably too early to make that call. I would say it\u2019s been consistent in terms of what we see happening. Peter Winter : Got it. Okay, thanks. Mac McCullough : Okay. Thanks Peter. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I return the call to our presenters. Steve Steinour : Well, we\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter and certainly the full-year 2015 results. We delivered 13% annual growth in earnings per share and 4% annual growth in tangible book value per share. 2015 results reflected a 12.4% return on tangible common equity, and a one-on-one return on tangible \u2013 return on assets. As we enter 2016, I\u2019m optimistic, equally optimistic, I should say, with regard to the year ahead. Our strategies are working. Our investments continue to drive results and our execution remains focused and strong focused and strong. We\u2019re gaining market share and we\u2019re taking share of wallet. So we expect to generate annual revenue growth consistent with our long-term financial goals, and we\u2019ll manage our continued investments in our businesses to the revenue environment. We continue to work toward becoming more efficient and improving returns. Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility, and driving solid consistent long-term performance. So I want to thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Tracy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Mark Muth, you may begin your conference. Mark Muth : Thank you, Tracy, and welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides, we will be reviewing, can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this Slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let's get started by turning to Slide 3 and an overview of the financials. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks, Mark, good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another quarter of solid results and believe 2016 is off to a good start. Huntington's customer centric strategy continues to deliver consistent growth in market share and share of wallet through execution of our distinctive fair play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service. Disciplined execution of our strategy and well timed investments in our businesses over the past several years are producing solid results for our shareholders, our customers, our colleagues and our communities. Slide 3 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.20, was up 5% from the 2015 first quarter, while tangible book value per share increased 8% to $7.12. Return on tangible common equity was 11.9%, while return on assets was 0.96%. Core fundamental trends remain strong and reflect the benefit of our strategic investments over the past several years. Year-over-year revenue growth was 7%, comprised of 8% increase in net interest income and a 4% increase in non-interest income. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top-line growth, despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. We also believe that our disciplined investment strategy combined with a focus on achieving positive operating leverage on an annual basis is proving to be a key differentiator. While we achieved positive operating leverage for the quarter, non-interest expense increased 7% year-over-year reflecting our ongoing investments including 44 new in-store branches and digital and technology investments such as our new mortgage origination platform that is currently being piloted. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6%, which remains well above our long-term financial goal of 56% to 59%. We will continue to work to improve our operating efficiency organically by growing revenue faster than expense, but we also continue to expect that our recently announced acquisition of FirstMerit will yield meaningful improvement in our pro forma efficiency. Turning to the balance sheet, average loan growth was 6% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth was 5%, continuing a seven quarter tend of year-over-year core deposit growth being greater than 5%. Overall, credit metrics remain solid. Criticized assets remain stable. We incurred only 7 basis points of net charge offs in the quarter as we continue to benefit from large commercial real estate recoveries. Non-performing assets increased 23 basis points from the previous quarter with the majority of the increase centered in our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios. Our capital ratios remained strong. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89%, up 7 basis points from year-end. While all regulatory capital ratios, except common equity Tier 1, increased meaningfully during the quarter due to the issuance of $400 million of perpetual preferred stock on March 21. Slide 4 provides a summary income statement, including some additional details on our non-interest income and non-interest expense for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, total reported revenue increased 7% to $754 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as net interest income increased 8% to $512 million. We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression. The NIM was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably the increase in our low yielding LCR compliant securities in our earning assets and higher cost senior bank notes in our funding mix. We continue to remain disciplined in pricing of both loans and deposits. Fee increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $242 million primarily driven by continued customer acquisition gains and relationship deepening. Highlights included a 13% increase in service charges on deposit accounts, and a 12% increase in card and payment processing income. We also faced some headwinds in the quarter in mortgage banking and trust service income. Mortgage banking income decreased 19% from the year ago quarter as a result of a 5% decline in origination volume, coupled with a $2 million decrease from net NSR activity. Trust services income declined 21% year-over-year primarily due to the sale of our funds management and servicing businesses at the end of last year. Reported non-interest expense in the 2016 first quarter was $491 million, an increase of $32 million, or 7% from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's non-interest expense included one significant item : $6 million of merger and acquisition related expense from the pending FirstMerit acquisition. As detailed on Page 7 of the press release, non-interest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $29 million or 6% year-over-year. In March, the FDIC announced the final rule approving the previously disclosed surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. In our conference call last quarter, we started that the surcharge would negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. Due to the delay and the implementation until July 1st, we now expect the negative impact will be approximately $7 million this year. Slide 5 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased $2.8 billion, or 6% year-over-year as most portfolios continue to experience year-over-year growth. Average securities increased $2.1 billion, or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR complaint securities into a lesser extent growth in our direct purchase municipal securities and our commercial banking segment. We are currently above the 100% threshold for liquidity coverage ratio. Digging into the loan growth little deeper, average commercial and industrial loans grew $1.5 billion, or 8%, primarily driven by $0.8 billion increase in asset finance. The quarter also benefited from continued momentum in auto floor plan and broad-based commercial lending. Average automobile loans grew $0.9 billion, or 11% from the year-ago quarter. Auto finance remains a core competency of Huntington and we're committed to this business and our dealer customers. The first quarter of 2016 represented the 9th consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of automobile loan originations. We have achieved this by remaining absolutely consistent in our strategy, which is built around a credit model that is focused on prime and super prime borrowers and a business model of high touch and local delivery. As detailed on Slide 46 and 47, in the appendix, our underwriting has not changed and our credit performance remains superior. Yields on the new auto paper rebounded slightly in the first quarter backup to around 3% compared to the 2.90% to 2.95% range in the fourth quarter. Recall yields last quarter were impacted by the normal seasonal mix shift towards new vehicle sales that occur in the fourth quarter as manufacturers try to drive yearly volume goals. While the first quarter's originations reflected a return to more normal, new used mix. The auto portfolio continues to perform very well as expected the seasonal increases in delinquencies and charge-offs we experienced in the fourth quarter reversed course this quarter with delinquencies declining 26 basis points sequentially and net charge-offs declining 5 basis points. Further, if you compare our delinquencies and non-accrual loans with the year ago quarter, you will see they're essentially flat. Net charge-offs are up modestly year-over-year, but will remain well below the level to which we underwrite the portfolio. Staying on Slide 5 and moving to the right side, average total deposits increased $2.9 billion or 5% over the year ago quarter including a $2.6 billion or 5% increase in average core deposits. We continue to see strong growth in demand deposits as average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 7% year-over-year, and average interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.6 billion or 26%. This growth reflects our continued focus on new customer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening. All of which are detailed on Slides 11 through 13 that Steve will discuss later. We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base at a higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs increased $0.5 billion, or 19%, year-over-year. Average total demand deposits accounted for 37% of non-equity funding in the 2016 first quarter, while money market and savings deposits accounted for a combined 38%. By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 3% of our non-equity funding in the quarter. Average total debt increased $2.1 billion, or 34%, as a result of five senior debt issuances over the past five quarters totaling $4.1 billion, including $1 billion issued in March of this year as well as the assumption of debts in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. The $1 billion senior debt issuance this quarter was a part of our normal funding strategy. Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields, interest bearing liability cost and other deposit cost. First quarter NIM decreased 4 basis points year-over-year, but increased 2 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.11%. This quarter, the net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio and another 1 basis point to 2 basis points in day count. Adjusting these benefits out of the first quarter margin, we expect another 2 basis points to 4 basis points of contraction in the second quarter, but remain comfortable reaffirming our previous guidance from last quarter that the net interest margin will remain above 3% for each quarter in 2016. Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, we estimate that net interest income would benefit by 3.6% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points, in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase from what we estimated a quarter ago, as we recently updated our non-maturity deposit models, resulting in a reduction in the sensitivity of these deposits. In addition, as we have discussed for some time, our asset swaps are beginning a period of steady amortization as disclosed in our 10-K. We also proactively terminated $1.9 billion of swaps in January taking advantage of volatility in the markets. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. These actions coupled with changes in our overall balance sheet mix drove the increase in modeled asset sensitivity. As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $5.8 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 5.4% in the up 200 basis point gradual ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $5.8 billion asset swap portfolio and $5.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including the respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $24 million in the 2016 first quarter, down from $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter and $25 million in the year ago quarter. Slide eight, shows the trends in our capital ratios. Tangible common equity increased 7 basis points sequentially to the 7.89%. All regulatory capital ratios improved meaning fully from the prior quarter end with the exception of common equity Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, which declined slightly. Late in the quarter, we issued 400 million of 6.25 fixed rate non-cumulative preferred equity in order to take advantage of unusual market conditions and low interest rate environment to lock in low cost permanent capital. With this issuance, we are now more in line with our peers with respect to the amount of preferred equity in our capital structure, although as market conditions allow, you may see us further optimize our capital structure in the future relative to the Basel III rules. Slide nine provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectation. Criticized assets remain stable. The loan loss provision was $27.6 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs represented 7 basis points of average loans and benefited from the previously mentioned large recovery and our commercial real estate portfolio. As we've stated last quarter, we expect credit costs will gradually migrate back to more normalized levels particularly as recoveries from previously charged-off commercial real estate loans diminish. For 2016, however, we expect net charge-offs will range below our long-term expectations of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.  The ACL ratio ticked up one basis point to 1.34% of loans and leases, compared to 1.33% at the prior quarter end. The ratio of allowance to non-accrual loans decreased to 138% compared to 180% a quarter ago due to the uptick in ALs primarily within our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio. Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart in the upper left shows an increase in the non-performing asset ratio for the quarter to 102 basis points compared to 79 basis points a quarter ago. The increase again primarily reflected several oil and gas exploration and production credits into one large coal credit, which replaced a non-accrual during the quarter. The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained essentially flat for the past year. The bottom left chart shows the criticized asset ratio, which also has remained relatively stable for the past few quarters. Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans at 48 basis points for the first quarter reflecting the oil and gas exploration and production in coal nonaccrual credits mentioned previously. All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Results were consistent with past exams and then we had a handful downgrades as well as some upgrades. We processed all the downgrades. However, we only processed a few of the upgrades as we believe we either have more recent or more complete information on the relationship or we simply opted to take a more conservative stance. This practice would also be consistent with past exams. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Mac. Slide 11 shows the continued progress driving what we believe to be industry leading customer acquisition and associated revenue growth from both acquiring and building meaningful banking relationships with these customers. We owe these results to the unique combination of our Fair Play banking philosophy, our welcome culture, and execution of our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus on relationship banking. Since 2010, we've increased our consumer checking households and business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compound annual growth rates respectively. These robust customer acquisition rates have allowed us to post the associated 5% and 9% compound annual growth rates in consumer and business revenue, which you can see in the two lower charts in the slide. You've heard me say this for a number of years and you'll hear me say it again in the future. Our focus remains on growing revenues. We continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment. Slide 12 and 13 illustrates the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. Our strategy has remained consistent since 2010 and has built around two simple objectives gained market share and gained share of wallet. Our track record has illustrated and we will continue to demonstrate that this strategy results both in more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers, as well as revenue growth. As of the quarter end, almost 53% of our consumer checking households use six or more products and services, up from 50% a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up $33 million or 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. Similarly, almost 48% of our commercial checking customers used four or more products or services at year end, up from 43% a year ago. Commercial revenue increased $4 million or 2% year-over-year and you'll notice a step-up this quarter in the number of business relationships utilizing four or more products or services. This increase results from a recent change in pricing for certain of our treasury management products and related impact on the measurement of products and services utilized by these customers. We expect this will represent a one-time step-up. Slides 14 and 15 provide a glimpse at some of the key economic data for our footprint. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our six core Midwestern States as well as other leading coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Unemployment rates in Ohio and Michigan are the lowest since the early 2000s and the unemployment rates in the four largest states in the footprint Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania are all at or below national unemployment rates. Further, the higher rate in the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Over 50% of the net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Finally, despite recent market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, average consumer confidence in the Midwest is around what it was in 2002. Slide 15 takes a \u2013 deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Most of the large MSA\u2019s in the footprint were near 15 year lows for unemployment levels at the end of January. As you can probably gather from this data we remain bullish, on our core Midwestern footprint. The auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016. Our small and medium sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses. Real estate markets across the footprint are improving. There is a significant amount of economic activity in our footprint tied to higher education and healthcare. And I continue to believe the benefit of low energy prices, for consumers and manufacturers more than outweighs the isolated pockets of stress on business, within the energy sector in our footprint. Our SBA lending also remained quite robust, in fact March was our best month ever for SBA originations. Turning to slide 16, while we're only one quarter into the year, slide 16 shows, that we're off to a good start to execute on our long-term financial goal of annual positive operating leverage. We expect, 2016 will represent our fourth consecutive year, to deliver positive operating leverage. So, with that let's turn to slide 17 for some closing remarks and messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. For this strategy entails, reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance, over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. Our value proposition, for both consumers and businesses, continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and refine or react where necessary. We've invested and will continue to invest in our businesses particularly around enhanced sales managements, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook and we expect to grow revenue. We are optimistic on our core Midwest footprints local economies and the businesses and consumers within them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained and the majority of our core consumer and small and medium size business customers enjoy a healthy near-term outlook. We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problem looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive and commercial loan utilization rates showed a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near-term. But we continue to expect that the NIM will remain above 3% throughout 2016. We expect to grow revenue despite these pressures consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and net event of MSR activity and obviously the impact of FirstMerit. We'll continue to place ongoing investments in our businesses consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual operating positive leverage. We closely monitor our loan portfolio and given the absolute low level of our credit metrics in recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility and \u2013 in our credit metrics going forward. Anticipates that loan loss provisioning for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels. So, let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon or simply moving off cyclical lows and we'll gradually move back toward normal for both provisioning in net charge offs. We expect our net charge offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Next we always like to include a reminder that there is little alignment between the Board, Management, our employees and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment, to being good stewards of shareholders and capital. And finally, before we move in to the Q&A period, I'd like to give you a quick update, on the status of the FirstMerit acquisition we announced earlier this year. We've filed our application with the regulators and anticipate that we will receive both regulatory and shareholder approval to allow us to close the transaction in the third quarter. We also continue our integration and planning, we've made significant progress in our product and data mapping process, as well as our planning around the organizational structure. The more we get to know, the FirstMerit team, the quality and depth of their talent, and similarity of cultures, the more excited I get about this transaction and our ability to deliver on our commitments, as we come together. So, I'll now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Operator, we'll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question, and one related follow-up and if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : At this time [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Mac McCullough : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to follow-up on the credit side and hearing your points about not seeing much else, but expecting the normalization. This is the \u2013 your second quarter of a pretty meaningful reserve build and I think for specific reason, so I guess just the questions are, can you help us understand kind of what you think the core charge-offs if we \u2013 and the size of that recovery and then just your general premise around building reserves from here. Do you think you've kind of gotten at there for what you need as far as the energy and coal related? Dan Neumeyer : Hey. Good morning. Ken, this is Dan. So, I think, the one thing this was a record quarter for us in terms of recoveries. So that 7 basis points charge-off is obviously very good performance, but it is driven by some really unusual \u2013 an unusual level of recovery so that is not going to continue. So if there is going to be one difference in the subsequent quarters, it's going to be a more normalized level of recovery, so that in and of itself will take the net charge-off number up, but we are not seeing anything on the horizon that leads us to conclude that there would be any notable changes other than that we've given guidance that we still expect to be below the 35 to 55, so I think that gives you a pretty good range of what we might see. In terms of the energy build this quarter, we think we've been very conservative in identifying the issues that we about there we are well reserved on that portfolio. We've got our credit mark on that portfolio at 10%, which given the combination \u2013 the constitution of our portfolio, no energy services have invested big differentiator when we're looking at energy exposure. Ours is all E&P very well secured exposure. So even if you say, there is going to be continued low energy prices, we think that portfolio on a relative basis is going to hold up quite well. Ken Usdin : Okay. Then just to follow up quickly then is just on reserving builds from here, more for growth or what if you think you've gotten the energy right, then what would be the base of seeing builds from here? Dan Neumeyer : I think \u2013 I think it will be largely driven by portfolio growth, and then again we do point out always there is \u2013 there is always unevenness in the C&I portfolio, so you are going to have episodic movements here and there, but we are not seeing any significant movement. I think you see in our criticize asset number holding fairly steady. We still have in flows, but we have a lot of good resolutions as well. So I don't see any tremendous movement there either. Ken Usdin : All right. Got it. Thank you. Dan Neumeyer : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers, Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Your line is now open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Scott. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : I just wanted to ask just sort of an energy related question. So of the total increase, are you - you guys able to sort of bifurcate how much of that came from the coal versus the E&P side by any chance? Steve Steinour : Yes. Absolutely we can and we do, do that. The coal was one transaction and actually it was not even performance related. This is a more of a \u2013 there is a lawsuit involved in it, so the coal deal actually is a low cost producer performing very well and we expect a good resolution to that particular situation. Scott Siefers : Okay. This might make the same question little less relevant, but as you look at \u2013 you have said some understandable increase in nonperformers in the energy area, but based on guidance for the entire portfolio, lost content, of course, looks pretty low and still in the aggregate for everything. Just wondering, as you guys are thinking about the sort of stuff that you would keep on, on watch from the energy portfolio. When or how might actual lost content manifest itself just in the way you guys are thinking about things? Steve Steinour : Yes. I mean, it certainly the potential for lost content increases the longer that we have that protected low energy phenomenon. So \u2013 but I'll say that the stressed analysis we do, there is still quite a bit of room between where we're at today and where we feel we would incur significant losses. So we do various stressing on the portfolio. Our sensitized case that we use is well below the strip case and we even do modeling that goes well below that and even under those scenario, this is going to be a very manageable series of events for us. Just, we have a very small portfolio \u2013 it's one-half of 1% of our entire portfolio for the overall impact. This is not going to be that dramatic. Scott Siefers : Yes. Okay. Perfect. If I can sneak one last one in there, Mac you have said, so you guys disclosed the two basis points margin benefit from the CRE recovery, did you say two basis points benefit from day count, so in other words in total four basis points of kind of net benefit of which you would be forecasting the margin for the second quarter? Mac McCullough : Scott, that's exactly the way to think about it. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you guys. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Scott. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about also \u2013 you sound pretty positive, but I guess looking at the year-on-year changes in net charge-offs to strip out some of the seasonality, but that has been a bit of an increase. So, can you talk about the normalization that you're seeing there and what makes you still pretty relaxed on auto credit? Dan Neumeyer : Sure. This is Dan, again. So, one \u2013 I think we have to look at \u2013 we're looking at very low levels of charge-offs. So, I think if you look to a year ago, probably about 19 basis points and then most recent quarter up to about 28 basis points. That is a very low level of charge-offs and well below what we actually modeled. So, I think that's important. There is a bit of an effect in there from we\u2019ve talked about TCPA, which is the telephone consumer protection act, which limited our ability to make a calls to cellphones, that had a small incremental effect. So, we probably have a couple of basis points of additional charge-offs that was in that number and that the impact of that will dissipate over time. But just as a reminder, our origination strategy on indirect auto has not moved at all. We continue to maintain the same FICO Scores, LTVs terms, it's a very dealer centric model and I think it is important, when we look at our portfolio relative to others. The distinction in terms of our focus on prime and super prime customers, when we expand in the different markets, which we do from time to time. We go in with more conservative origination criteria than for the book as a whole. So, we just feel we have been rock solid in our origination strategies and don't expect to see any significant movement. So, we remain very confident in our performance. Geoffrey Elliott : Okay. And then just follow-up, there has been a decline in the Manheim in the last couple of months. What are you budgeting for used car prices and how do you think about that? Steve Steinour : Yes. So, we've look \u2013 we obviously follow the Manheim closely, and I think their forecast called for the index to decline about 8% cumulatively over the next few years. And even with that adjustment, we don't see this moving the needle significantly in terms of our performance. I would point out that the mix of our vehicles is a little bit different than what industry average would be as well. When you focus on a high FICO borrower, when you have to take the vehicles back you tend to get a vehicle that is in better shape and having a higher resale value. I think the mix of our book also has more trucks and SUVs in it, and those values tend to hold up better than vehicles as a whole. So, those factors also are going to aid us, so we feel very confident even though we know there will be some reduction in the Manheim because we've been at historically high levels for probably the last five years or six years. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you very much. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Geoff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is now open. Kyle Peterson : Hey, good morning guys. This is actually Kyle Peterson speaking for Bob today. I had a question on mortgage banking, kind of your thoughts on that obviously it looks like part of \u2013 it was down partly due to kind of seasonal trends. But, notice it was comes down year-over-year as well, I'm not sure if you view that is mostly really to kind of the MSR impairment or I guess kind of how should we look at mortgage banking moving forward? Mac McCullough : Yes. Kyle, this is Mac. So, I think if you take a look on a linked-quarter basis there was a fairly substantial decline, that's really \u2013 this can be explained by two things. One is the MSR impairment, which was $6 million to $7 million on a linked-quarter basis, and the other portion of the decline was just due to lower origination volume. So that \u2013 I think that explains linked-quarter pretty well and actually that's the same explanation for year-over-year it's MSR and lower origination. So we're pleased with origination volume where it is that currently. We do have this seasonal effects and also just the impact of the MSR valuation. Kyle Peterson : Okay. Thank you. And yes, I guess just one other kind of I guess follow-up kind of modeling question. Is the merger related expense for the HBAN for the FirstMerit merger. Is that following into the other expense line item or kind of I guess where is that $6 million shaking up? Mac McCullough : Yes. A fair amount of it's going to be in professional services in that line and other expense as well. So, that's \u2013 I think that\u2019s the way to think about it. Steve Steinour : Kyle, that's broken out on page seven on the release. There is the table that will give you some guidance there. Kyle Peterson : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open. Steve Moss : Good morning. It's actually Steve Moss for John. I wanted to just touch based on the inflows to non-performing status, how much of the $240 million was for E&P? Mac McCullough : E&P was about 40% of the inflows. Steve Moss : Okay. And then in terms of also in the E&P credits in what basins are your E&P credits located? Mac McCullough : Our entire portfolio is \u2013 it's broadly syndicated shared national credit, so the distribution tends to be very granular throughout the country, obviously would include the Permian basin which is probably one of the most profitable, but I would say it's very well diversified, no concentrations within the portfolio. Steve Moss : Okay. Thank you very much. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Dodd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ricky Dodd : Hi, everyone. Steve Steinour : Hi, Ricky. Ricky Dodd : I just had a quick follow-up on energy. Have you guys provided the dollar value as of period end for your total energy and coal portfolios? Steve Steinour : The aggregate amount of the loans? Ricky Dodd : That's right. Steve Steinour : We've indicated that it's right around 5% of total loans. Mac McCullough : 0.5%. Steve Steinour : I'm sorry \u2013 a big difference. Thank you. 0.5%. Ricky Dodd : And then you said reserves on those loans are about 10%? Steve Steinour : Yes. The credit mark, which on a go-forward basis will reference credit mark that takes into account charge-offs and reserves, but it's yes 10% is the number. Ricky Dodd : Perfect, and then a quick follow-up on recoveries. I think eight of the past nine quarters you've seen some lumpy recoveries in the CRE portfolio. How should we be thinking about that going forward? Steve Steinour : That there will be less. Ricky Dodd : All right. Perfect. Thanks for the time. Steve Steinour : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Hi, Kevin. Mac McCullough : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Barker : The order growth is very strong this quarter and what \u2013 usually the January and February usually seasonally pretty slow. How much of this growth is due to existing markets and how much of it was taking market share in the new markets that you're attempting to target? Mac McCullough : Which portfolio? Kevin Barker : Auto. Mac McCullough : So it\u2019s still on the auto portfolio. So, we're stepping into the new market, as Dan mentioned very, very cautiously, we actually increased our standards and how we underwrite in newer markets. Dan Neumeyer : Yes. And I think, in \u2013 of the year-over-year increase in originations, about 25% came from Illinois, North Dakota, South Dakota, which were our newest markets that we entered into. Kevin Barker : So, roughly, 25% of your incremental was primarily due to the newer market, is that how you would categorize it? Steve Steinour : Correct. Kevin Barker : Then \u2013 and also, a follow-up on the balance sheet items. You obviously shifted gears and become more asset sensitive when you mentioned some of this last quarter and your NIM has increased this quarter. When we look forward, given your guidance for NIM to decline, how should we look at it, going into back half of the year? And then what your expectations are for the Fed increased rate? Mac McCullough : So, starting with the last question first. I mean, we've budget in and continue to forecast 2016 assuming no rate increase. And under that scenario, which is the scenario that we use in order to provide the guidance for the year. As Scott pointed out, earlier, the 3.11% that we reported probably comes down about four basis points, due to four basis points. And whether that compression is been driven just due to the fact that we're adding the LCR compliant securities. And then on the funding side, a lot of that is coming through on the debt side. So that results in some compression as we move. Throughout the year there is some additional compression that will take place on certain asset categories. But, again based on everything we know today and way the forecast looks for the remainder of the year, we do believe we stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016. Kevin Barker : Okay. What would drive the additional compression from outside \u2013 is it just lower asset yields or other items that were push down and NIM in the back end. Mac McCullough : Given the fact that we're at 100% or over 100% for LCR, it's going to be asset compression for the most part, just continued pricing pressure on commercial portfolio. But again, not material as we think about where we are today, and the guidance that were given for the rest of the year. Kevin Barker : Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Kevin. Steve Steinour : Hey Mac, I want to clarification in Ricky\u2019s question, I didn't realize he asked about our exposure including coal, and oil and gas. And so when we take the E&P and the coal together it still less than 1% of revenues, but the half percent was in relation to just the E&P did not include coal, but our coal portfolio is actually about half of the size of E&P. So, it still well under 1% when we combine those. So, I just want to make that clarification. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Stapp with Hilliard Lyons. Your line is now open. Andy Stapp : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Andy. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Andy. Andy Stapp : What was driving the sequential increase and other non-interest income other than the general lumpiness that can occur in the side? Mac McCullough : So, fourth quarter compared to the first quarter? Andy Stapp : Yes, sequentially, yes. Mac McCullough : So, on Table 6 of the press release, we actually show other non-interest income going down. Andy Stapp : Right, it went down pretty substantially \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, yes, that's why I mean to say sequential decline\u2026 Mac McCullough : Yes, I think exactly. Andy Stapp : Yes. I just wonder why it was driving that if that's a good run rate? Steve Steinour : It\u2019s a model. Mac McCullough : It's a bit difficult of lines of forecast. Andy Stapp : Right. Mac McCullough : There is a lot of [indiscernible] gains that go through there, there is leased income that goes through there. So, it is a bit lumpy in the scheme things, I think taking a look at just the quarterly progression over time and taking an average might be the best way to think about it. Andy Stapp : Okay. And, what was your \u2013 what's your reserve or your credit marks on oil and gas versus coal, I want to ask that as well? Mac McCullough : Actually, they are equal, 10%. Andy Stapp : Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Peter Winter : Good morning. Mac McCullough : Hi, Peter. Peter Winter : I had a question about the loan growth. So, average loans was pretty solid and then in the period was even stronger. So I was just wondering in terms of the monthly trend, did it start off a little bit slow with all the volatility and then pick up as the year \u2013 as the quarter moved on and that would carry over into the second quarter? Mac McCullough : Peter, that's a very good conclusion, accurate conclusion, good analogy. And I think the volatility just had people paused as the quarter progressed more confidence emerged. And as we sit here today, our pipelines look reasonably good, going into the second quarter. And frankly they did at the end of the fourth quarter, again that volatility just created, I think a bit of a timing issue. Peter Winter : Okay and just a quick follow-up. Steve, you mentioned on the FirstMerit, as you spend more time you feel better about the FirstMerit deal. I was just wondering if you could add some color to that? Steve Steinour : Well we\u2019ve spent considerable amount of time with our team and their team. I mentioned we've gotten through much of the product matching, and mapping, and so the things that would be done early-stage for integration purposes are well underway, terrific cooperation and communication, and we continue to be very impressed with the quality of the people where \u2013 from FirstMerit that we have the pleasure of interacting with. So we had outlined a sequential integration plan when we announced the deal. We\u2019re certainly well on track with that and expecting to get approvals necessary to close in the third quarter. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks very much. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Steve. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joe Shea with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Joe Shea : Good morning. Just related to industry positioning, what's the incremental impact on our asset sensitivity positioning over the next few quarters as the swap book rolls off. And then just more broadly, is there a certain level of asset sensitivity that you are targeting over time, can you just walk us through how your thinking about overall positioning? Mac McCullough : So, on the first question Joe, about 70% of our \u2013 of the margin benefit from our derivatives actually comes from the debt swaps. So, when you think about the impact of the asset swaps at about 30% of the impact and if you roll that forward, I think we see another $2.4 billion of the asset swaps coming off by the end of 2016, and the remainder come off basically by the end of 2017. That impact is completely manageable when you think about the quarter-over-quarter impact and how slow those are rolling off. On the second question, we really don't have a target in terms of what we\u2019re looking for. We do think eventually it\u2019s going to be good to be asset sensitive. We\u2019re very comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned today, and how we're managing the balance sheet, with the swaps rolling off. And I think some of the changes that we've made in the non-maturity deposits we have seen the increase in asset sensitivity. But, again we\u2019re very comfortable with how the balance sheet is positioned and the outlook for interest rates as we go through 2016. Joe Shea : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now open. Terry McEvoy : Thanks. Can you just talk about the 2% C&I growth in the quarter maybe some industries that stand out, as well as maybe some markets that come to mind? Steve Steinour : Well, our core markets have done well. So, Ohio and Michigan have had good growth. And we've also had growth on the assets \u2013 in the asset finance portfolio Terry. So like what we\u2019re seeing with how the year is progressing at least at this stage, and we're feeling much more confident with the market settling down and this volatility, abating from where it was in early January, February. Terry McEvoy : And then on the equity you're talking about the efficiency ratio at 65%, above that 56% to 59% long-term target. Can you just remind us what FirstMerit will do to the efficiency ratio? I'm pretty sure it was addressed in the investor handout, once you get to the full run rate of cost saves? Steve Steinour : Yes, we had it coming down 300 basis points to 400 basis points I think is what we disclosed in that investor presentation. So clearly a good opportunity for us when you think about 80% of their markets overlapping with ours and the number of consolidations that we're going to be able to achieve. Terry McEvoy : Great. Thanks for helping me there. I appreciate it. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Terry. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Steinour I'll turn the call over to you for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Thank you. We are off to a good start in 2016 as our first quarter results provided a solid base to build from. We delivered 7% year-over-year revenue growth, 3% net income growth and 5% growth in EPS and an 8% increase in tangible book value per share. So these are solid fundamentals and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver good results through the remainder of the year. You've heard me say this before and it remains true, our strategies are working and our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improve share wallet in both consumers and businesses. We expect to generate annual revenue growth consistent with our long-term financial goals and manage our continued investments in our businesses, consistent with the revenue environment and our long-term financial goal of positive operating leverage. We\u2019re optimistic on the economic outlook in our footprint and believe the gradual transition to more normalized credit metrics will be effectively managed. Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long-term shareholders and our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth - Director of Investor Relations : Thank you, Carol, and welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com, or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast, starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call. As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to the slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let's get started by turning to slide three and an overview of the financials. Mac? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mark, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016, built on the strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning. We have followed a contrarian path since 2009, focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. While others have pulled back with a focus on cost-cutting, we invested on our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. Second quarter results, again, provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a high level. Turning to slide three, let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11%, while reported return on assets was 0.96%. Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. Non-interest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. Non-interest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased the reported efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal. Balance sheet growth continued to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year, while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. Overall credit performance continues to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remain well below our long-term financial target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Non-performing assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Turning to slide four, and diving in deeper to the income statement, net interest income was up 3% from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression. Non-interest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by 8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015. Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund-servicing businesses, as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix. Non-interest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit integration expense accounting for $21 million of the increase. After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, non-interest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by salary expense, medical claims, and technology investments. Of note, we continue to see wage inflation, given the relatively low unemployment levels in many of our markets. Turning to slide five, let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined and strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack. Auto lending increased 26% from the year-ago quarter, as production continued at record levels, while we maintained our long-standing underwriting consistency and discipline. Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix show the underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance, dealer floor plan and corporate banking. Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio run-off into LCR-compliant securities, and to a lesser extent, growth in direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning assets from the year-ago quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide, average total deposits increased 5% over the year-ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits. Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. Our focus on new consumer checking, household and commercial relationship account acquisition, as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits. Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion in senior debt over the past five quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings. Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. We also continued remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other, less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year. The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year, while security yields declined 9 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past four quarters, as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield, and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect net interest margin at stand-alone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining two quarters of 2016. Slide seven provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risks. As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for stand-alone Huntington projects that net interest income would benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the curve \u2013 implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our asset swap book continue to mature. Though we expect additional run-off from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered and there are no cliffs moving on the horizon. As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4%, in the up 200 basis point gradual ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $19 million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year-ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps. Turning to slide eight, we see our capital ratios which increased across the board on both the year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Tangible common equity as of the quarter is 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter. Referring to slide nine, we booked provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $17 million. This modest reserve bill, along with the reduction in NPLs, led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. The ACL as a percentage of loans fell 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth. Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter as indicated on slide 10. NPA is still in the quarter, as new inflows were down substantially for prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. New additions to criticized were offset by upgrades and pay downs. Delinquencies were also well-controlled, exhibiting continued reductions. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Stephen D. Steinour - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mac. I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken a contrarian approach for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition and relationship deepening through our Fair Play banking philosophy. Slide 10 (sic) [Slide 11] shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010, while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009, while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period. I want to call out particularly strong revenue growth on the consumer side over the last five quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014. And the investments in data and analytics we began in 2015 are starting to show results. We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked quarter growth. Now, these are very strong numbers, and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed, the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, this strategy has remained consistent, since put in place in 2009, and we continue to see progress. The next two slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households use six or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. On the commercial side, 47% use four of our products \u2013 or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. These figures are important, and ones we monitor closely. We believe the revenue growth is result of a deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our product, services and experiences to fit those needs. So, we're not just adding new customers, we're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships. Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom-left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our six Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan, in particular, remain at or near their lowest level since the early-2000s. The chart on top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May shows that five states of the six states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next six months. Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs' footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, in particular, continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. There's additional cause for optimism here in our home footprint. Per capita disposable personal income growth has outpaced the national average through the recovery, and continued to do so through the second quarter. Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average. Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. A higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation, and over 50% of net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Three states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession. Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near the 2002 levels. Now, we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it can pose to business here in our footprint, but effects, so far, had been modest. Turning to slide 16, operating leverage. The first six months through the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall, this is almost exactly where we were at the end of the second quarter of 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year of doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal. So, with that, let's turn to slide 20 (sic) [slide 17] for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate to moderate risk to low risk profile throughout. Our DFAST stress loss estimates continue to reflect comparatively well, and for this year, included FirstMerit loan portfolios. Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continues to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand, with differentiated products and superior customer service. For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others. We continue to execute our strategies and refine or react when necessary. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We expect to grow revenue. We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well-contained. We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for stand-alone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016. We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure, consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items, net MSR activity, and the impact of FirstMerit. We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward, and as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels. Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows, and we'll gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Next, we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees, and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold-through-retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital. Finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received sign-off from the Department of Justice for a divestiture that resolves our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We've identified the branch closures that will occur coincident with the branch conversion in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress in building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress, as our IT teams have completed all product mapping and are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016. I'll now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Thank you. Mark Muth - Director of Investor Relations : Thanks, Steve. Operator, we'll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : And your first question today comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Good morning, Erica. Stephen D. Steinour - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Erica. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, I apologize if you've already addressed it in the prepared remarks. There are a bunch of calls that are happening today. Very much noting that you've reiterated your goal for revenue growth and annual positive operating leverage, and I'm wondering how we should think of that $503 million core run rate as we move into the second half of the year? And also, as we think about core Huntington ex FirstMerit for 2017, I know it's a little too early, but you do have some peers that in the face of lower for even longer did give a little bit more color on how they're thinking about expense management over the medium term. And just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. Hi, Erika, it's Mac. So, as you think about the expense base in the second quarter, keep in mind, we're very focused on the FirstMerit integration. We've had a lot of focus, a lot of attention going into that. We're being very disciplined in how we approach the expenditures right now. And I think, that's a good base if you think about core Huntington. As it relates to 2017 and beyond, the focus we have on positive operating leverage, we are going to each planning year, understanding the revenue environment. And in particular, we've been planning, assuming a rate environment that's flat. And we've been building our expense base that allows us to achieve positive operating leverage. So, we're going to continue to take that approach going forward. Also, keep in mind, we've got the cost takeouts from FirstMerit that will start to materialize in 2016 and 2017. And we're highly confident in terms of the cost takeout achievement that we put on the table. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And just a follow-up question on CCAR, clearly, a lot of ink has been written about your quantitative results. And I'm wondering if you could share any insight in terms of how that process went, and how \u2013 the Fed was thinking about the timing of the deal close and whether or not that those results are really just sort of onetime in your mind relative to the timing of when the deal was going to close. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yes. It's a good question, Erika. And, clearly, we don't have complete insights into what happens inside the black box. And we do think that the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition, if that's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective. So, we knew going into this year's CCAR process that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to the tune of 120 basis points on average. And that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 in returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the two years. Also, keep in mind that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So, that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed on announcement of FirstMerit that we had 100 basis point impact to CET1 because of the structure of the transaction, so that impacted as well. And then, finally, we know that as we went through a business combination in a severely adverse scenario inside the CCAR process, that it probably cost us 50 basis points to 70 basis points of CET1. So, when you reconcile all those things and consider everything but the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Good morning, Bob. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: I just wondering if you could touch a little bit on the personnel cost. The adjusted personnel cost number was higher than we were looking for. Was there much in terms of variable comp related to the strong mortgage banking quarter in that number, or what were some of the drivers of the sequential increase in the quarter that, I guess, seasonally usually would be a little bit better? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. Bob, there were a few things that impacted that. I think you did see merit increases come into effect in the quarter. We also had some higher comp related to mortgage, as you point out. And then we have higher healthcare costs, which I pointed out in my comments, just some higher medical expense relative to prior years. But those are the primary things that impact that. And I would say, outside of the medical costs, nothing extraordinary. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Can you quantify the medical and the \u2013 maybe the variable mortgage comp? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : In the scheme of things, I think the medical might have been a couple million dollars. And the mortgage comp side, I don't really have it at my fingertips right now. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then it was a real strong quarter for mortgage banking. Curious just how the pipeline looks headed into the third quarter, and whether you think this is a level that we repeat in this third quarter possibly? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. Pipelines are strong. We're seeing good purchase volume. And, of course, refi is picking up as well. So, really, really good quarter, as you point out. And, in particular, when you think about year-over-year, the $8 million MSR net impact, $6 million gain last year, $2 million loss this year. So, the outlook is good, just given where the pipeline is today. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott, Autonomous. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Two more CCAR-related questions. The \u2013 I guess, a question and a follow-up. But the first is you said in the presentation when you announced the FirstMerit deal that you were suspending the buyback, I think, until the deal closed? And then, no announcement, no buyback, asked for the full CCAR submission. So, why that change? And then, secondly, just wanted to clarify on the 4Q 2016 to Q2 2015, 50% total payout. Do we now just think about that leading from 3Q 2017 to 2Q 2018 up for that shorter period? Thank you. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yes. Geoff, it's Mac. So, starting with the first question. Clearly, as we went through CCAR this year, the most important outcome for us was getting the FirstMerit deal through the process and getting approval for the deal itself. Of course, we're still waiting for approval, we expect that to happen in the third quarter. But we just thought it best to be a bit cautious and making sure that we got through the process, because we can create so much more value by getting FirstMerit closed early and on time relative to the buyback that we had in for 2016 CCAR process. What I would tell you going forward is that we'll take each year as it comes. Next year is a different process. We expect to be in a different position. Not quite sure what the economic scenarios that the Fed will give to us will look like. So, don't want to comment on what the future looks like. But that's basically our thought process around this year's process. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : And do you expect the deal closing during 3Q? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : We still expect to get the 3Q closing. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Thank you. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Mac, you're increasing your asset sensitivity in a time when most of the market is expecting a lot less in rate hikes. You have a lot of banks that are moving the other direction. They've been asset-sensitive throughout, anticipating what the Fed was going to do. Now that they don't have that hope anymore, they're kind of swimming, what I would call, out of the pool of pain and trying to get as much as they can before the yield curve kind of collapses on the back end on them. You're really going in the opposite direction and creating a lot of revenue headwinds when you're looking at about $10 million from the peak of what you were getting out of the swaps. Are you still committed to do this, and do you feel like \u2013 what's the behind-the-scenes driving you in this direction? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. Thanks, Marty. So, just a few things to think about. So, the asset sensitivity numbers that we published are a 200 basis point gradual increase scenario. If you think about where the rate curve is today and you think about a flat rate environment going forward, over the next 12 months we have maybe 1 basis point or two basis points of margin at risk. So, I'm not totally uncomfortable with that position, plus we've got the FirstMerit closing, integration, and I would say, optimization of the two balance sheets as they come together. So, we have that entire process to work through as well. So, that's the way I'd take a look at it. We feel good about the margin and where it's at today. We still believe that we're above 3% for the remainder of the year in core Huntington. And if you take a look at FirstMerit, excluding any impact from the first accounting adjustments, it's actually additive to the margin. So, that's our perspective, Marty. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : When you're looking at issuing the debt, what are you matching that up against on the asset side? So, kind of what is the \u2013 is there a balance in securities and trying to not have any more asset sensitivity come from that initiative as well, or are you matching it against shorter-term assets that will increase your asset sensitivity? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. It's primarily funding the securities. And that's been a bit of the pressure that we've had on the margin over the past year. Today, we're bringing securities on at probably close to 1.9%. And the next issuance that we \u2013 if we issued debt today, we'd probably be in the 210 basis points range, something like that, swap to floating. So, you can see where some of the pressure starts to build from a margin perspective. But having said that, we're at 115% LCR right now. We feel good about where we are from a securities perspective. And really, we're just replacing and also keeping in mind the amount of debt that we need from a rating agency perspective and an FDIC perspective. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : You bet. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Hi, Bill. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: You guys have been \u2013 Hi. You guys have been spot on in calling for used car prices to continue to hold up, even when others have kind of taken the opposing view, and really just based on the idea that new car payments continue to exceed used car payments by increasingly larger amounts and not everyone can afford a new car payment. And that's been the right view. And as we look at the market now though, it seems like there's increasingly more controversy around whether the Manheim Index can hold up from its current levels. Can you share your updated thoughts on the sustainability of used car prices at these levels, and how important is that to the continued health of the market? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Sure, Bill. This is Dan. We plan \u2013 one, the Manheim scale, as you suggested, it has held up. And we don't expect it to necessarily be sustained at those levels, but even when we look at a worst-case scenario, I think we have a chart in the deck that shows what the Manheim has been over the last 10 or so years, and I think it bottomed out in the 107 range briefly. And we have stressed the portfolio on our end going down to 100, which we don't think is really possible. But even at that level, the impact to us on our portfolio is about 9 basis points of charge-offs. Keep in mind, we have a different customer base than average. So, with our prime \u2013 super-prime focus, we managed the probability of the cost. We think that we will \u2013 our portfolio will have a much lower incidence than default. And therefore, the impact of the used car value relative to the rest of the market is not as significant. So, we're very comfortable where we stand. And even if the index were to fall, we think we're very well-positioned. Again, we have a differentiated model from what an average would have. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Hi. Good morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just a quick question. Just in terms of the merger costs. Looks like I probably underestimated them this quarter. But can you just give us an estimate sort of timing of when those might come in from quarter to quarter? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Ken, so we're still tracking, we said about $420 million when we announced the acquisition. And I would tell you that we've probably realized 75% of that in 2016, is the way I would think about it. It's going to start to tick up from here. We're, obviously, very deep into the integration process. But that's how I would think about it from a timing perspective. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Okay. That does help, actually. And then just a quick question. On the preferred stock dividends, were there any sort of unusual catch? I think it was like $19 million in total this quarter \u2013 I wouldn't have thought it would be that high, given what you issued. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, there was a bit of a stub period related to the first quarter payment for the period that it was moved out, about $3 million. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you. So, in an all-in basis next quarter, what should the run rate be for pref? Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : It's going to be 6.25 times the $600 million is the way to think about it. So, about $70 million. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. Okay. Thank you. Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks, Ken. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks. Stephen D. Steinour - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, thank you. The second quarter built upon a solid foundation we laid in the first quarter. The performance continues to be solid, delivering revenue growth despite challenging headwinds. And our fundamentals remain solid, and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver through the remainder of the year. You've heard me say this before and it remains true. Our strategies are working and our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improved share of wallet. We expect to generate annual revenue growth, consistent with our long-term financial goals and manage our continued investments in our businesses consistent with the revenue environment and our long-term financial goal of positive operating leverage annually. We expect modest growth in our economic footprint and continue the gradual transition to more normalized credit metrics, which will be effectively managed. We've made significant progress in our integration planning for the FirstMerit acquisition, and we look forward to completing the acquisition later this quarter, following receipt of all regulatory approvals and our customary closing conditions. Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and its management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priorities include increasing primary relationships across our business segments, managing risks, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent, long-term performance. So, thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Ruth and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mark Muth, you may begin your conference. Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thank you, Ruth, and welcome, everyone. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com, or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast, starting about an hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call. As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let's get started by turning to slide three and an overview of the financials. Mac? Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by acknowledging that the third quarter was a bit noisy, but underneath the noise we are very pleased with the core financial performance. As you know, the FirstMerit acquisition closed on August 16. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit received 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5 in cash for each share of FirstMerit common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $3.7 billion, including $0.8 billion of cash, $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. Huntington issued 284 million shares of common stock that had a total fair value of $2.8 billion based on the closing market price of $9.68 per share on August 15 of 2016. We are extremely pleased with the progress we are making in bringing the two companies together as one. We believe the combination strengthens our company by improving efficiency, accelerating our long-term growth rate and driving a higher return profile. We are excited to have the opportunity to introduce our strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set, and industry-leading customer service in new geographies and to new customers. Integration is moving along as expected and our new colleagues are embracing our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture. Turning to slide three, let's review the financial highlights of our third quarter. Huntington recorded earnings per common share of $0.11, inclusive of $0.11 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.48 per share. Return on tangible common equity was 7% while return on assets was 0.58%. Except where noted, all comparisons to previous quarters are inclusive of FirstMerit. But I want to emphasize that core organic performance continued to meet our expectations. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 24%, with net interest income up 26% and noninterest income up 19%. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% year-over-year. Noninterest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $7 million or 14% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, the accelerated buildout of our in-store channel last fall, and ongoing technology investments. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 75%. However, the acquisition-related expense stemming from the FirstMerit transaction added 17 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. While revenue strength in the quarter, including mortgage banking, capital markets, and a large interest recovery, combined with a $4 million expense benefit from retiring trust preferred debt, lowered the core efficiency ratio by approximately 150 basis points, we are pleased with the progress toward achieving our long-term efficiency ratio goal of 56% to 59%. Balance sheet growth in the third quarter showed continued organic strength, which was enhanced by the addition of FirstMerit's loan and deposit base. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. Average core deposits grew 22% year-over-year, with average core deposit growth excluding FirstMerit registering 3%. Our third quarter credit performance reflects Huntington's commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Net charge-offs of 26 basis points remain below our long-term financial target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Nonperforming assets improved 21 basis points to 0.72% compared with the linked quarter. Criticized assets and delinquencies have remained at a relatively tight range for the past several quarters. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 63 basis points year-over-year and 71 basis points linked quarter to 9.09%, reflecting the impact of the FirstMerit transaction. Turning to slide four and getting more in-depth with the income statement. Net interest income was up 26% from year-ago quarter as were average earning assets, reflecting strong organic loan growth and the impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. The net interest margin for the quarter came in at 3.18%, up two basis points from the year-ago quarter and up 12 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 12 basis points on the margin and we had an interest recovery in the quarter that added an additional two basis points. Noninterest income increased $49 million or 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FirstMerit, but also driven by strong organic growth in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% from a year-ago, with significant items accounting for $116 million of the increase. After adjusting for significant items, noninterest expense increased 14%, primarily reflecting the impact of bringing FirstMerit on for one-and-a-half months in the current quarter. I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the transaction. All the cost savings are identified, being executed against, and will be implemented within one year of the deal closing, with the vast majority implemented prior to or coincident with the branch and systems conversion over President's Day weekend in the first quarter of 2017. In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches or roughly 9% of the combined post divestiture branch network. In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating nine legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter of 2017. Turning to slide five, let's review operating leverage. As you would expect, the combined entity has significant positive operating leverage through nine months. Positive operating leverage remains an important annual financial goal which we delivered on in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and, of course, we expect to deliver, again, in 2016. Turning to slide six, let's look at balance sheet trends. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the page, the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. The chart on the right side of the page illustrates how the addition of FirstMerit has increased the proportion of low cost DDA in our funding mix. Average securities increased 32% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of $7.4 billion from FirstMerit, additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities, and growth in direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. Our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 110% at quarter end. Average total debt increased $2.9 billion or 42% as a result of the issuance of $3.3 billion in senior debt over the past five quarters. Turning to slide seven, as previously discussed, we have continued to evaluate opportunities to optimize the balance sheet. And while not affecting quarterly average balances, approximately $2.6 billion of total loans and leases comprised of $1.5 billion of auto loans, $1 billion of predominantly non-relationship C&I loans and leases and $1 billion of predominantly non-relationship CRE loans were moved to loans held-for-sale at the end of the third quarter. We are taking these actions to improve risk-weighted asset efficiency and specific to the C&I and CRE assets to free up capital that was not generating acceptable returns. Regarding the $1.5 billion of auto loans moved to held-for-sale, our intention is to securitize these assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. Let me emphasize that we remain steadfast to our commitment to our auto finance business, including our well-established strategy which is built upon deep, long-term relationships with our core dealer customers and our focus on prime and super-prime indirect lending. However, we are reducing our indirect auto concentration limit back down to 150% of capital, and we are adopting an operating guideline of 125% of capital. You might remember that in mid-2015, before we had an agreement in place with FirstMerit, we increased our indirect auto concentration limit to 175% of capital. Given the larger capital base of the new combined organization, we cannot foresee any circumstance in which we would grow our indirect auto portfolio anywhere close to the 175% of capital. In addition, with the new 125% operating guideline in line, we expect to return to the securitization markets on an annual basis going forward. Moving to slide eight. Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the third quarter, up two basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected a 10 basis point increase in earning asset yields, a two basis point increase in the benefit from noninterest bearing deposits and a 10 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields improved 16 basis points year-over-year while securities yields declined to 12 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past five quarters as the cost of deposits was unchanged year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 12 basis points driven by an 11 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and a one basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the margin in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, the core net interest margins was 3.06% or unchanged from the prior quarter. In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, one large interest recovery added two basis points to the margin during the third quarter. Finally, as we communicated previously, core NIM will stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016. Slide nine illustrates the impact of our capital ratios of effectively deploying capital through the acquisition of FirstMerit. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 75 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points linked quarter. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.09%, down 63 basis points year-over-year and down 71 basis points sequentially. Referring to slide 10, we booked provision expense of $64 million compared to net charge-offs of $40 million. The higher provision expense compared to the prior quarter was the result of a higher level of net charge-offs, organic loan growth and incremental reserves on the legacy FirstMerit portfolio and excess of the credit mark due to the rate mark partially offsetting the credit mark on certain portfolios. In addition, there was approximately $10 million of incremental loan loss provision expense in the third quarter associated with the previously discussed movement of loans held-for-sale. Net charge-offs, while higher, represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 1.06%, reflecting the addition of the FirstMerit loan portfolio to the denominator, without additional reserves being added to the numerator due to the credit mark applied through the purchase accounting process. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 174% as a result of the continued decline in nonaccrual loans. On slide 11, the asset quality metrics remain favorable in the quarter as indicated. The nonperforming asset ratio increased further, reaching its lowest level in two years at 0.72%. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly to 3.54% but has remained in the 3.5% range for the past several quarters. Delinquencies were also well controlled, having remained relatively flat for the past six quarters. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Mac. Normally, at this point in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter, given the recent addition of FirstMerit and our inability to produce similar data for legacy FirstMerit customers. We believe providing OCR data for just legacy Huntington customers will not provide you with the complete picture. Let me assure you, though, that we remain fully committed to our Fair Play philosophy and OCR strategy, which is built upon the simple thesis of putting customers first, looking after their needs, and doing the right thing will result in more substantial, long-term customer relationships. Now, for years, we've focused on customer acquisition and relationship deepening with our Fair Play banking philosophy and our OCR strategy. While this was considered a contrarian approach when we started these actions back in 2009 and 2010, the results paint a picture of resounding success. And I want to stress that we are not just seeking relationship growth but, indeed, are looking to deepen existing relationships. Our OCR strategy is also built upon the fundamental belief that we are here to understand and serve our customers' needs. The Fair Play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers with products and services that are simple, clear and fair. We couple that with a customer experience designed to fit their needs, not ours. For us, the strategy has remained consistent since it was put in place in 2010 and it continues to bear fruit. In light of the recent headlines, some of you have asked about our sales and incentive compensation practices and complaint management, particularly with respect to our OCR strategy. The focus of our OCR model is on building, deep, trusted and lasting relationships. And this is achieved by getting to know our customers, understanding their needs and helping them meet their financial needs with the appropriate products and services. Further, Huntington is a company built upon a distinguished legacy of superior customer service. Our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture are built upon the premise and promise of doing the right thing for our customers. As you'd expect, given the investor, media and regulatory interest in this matter, we've undertaken a detailed review of our practices, policies and procedures for any signs of misalignment of incentives or other areas of risk or concern. While the review is ongoing, to-date, we've not uncovered any systemic, cultural or operational areas of concern. We will likely refine some of our monitoring, but we do not anticipate any material changes to our practices or procedures and certainly not to our overall OCR strategy. Moving to the economy, slide 12 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our now eight core Midwestern states. As you can see, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average with Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin particularly showing resilience this past quarter. Charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of August, show that all eight states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next six months. Slide 13 focuses on trends and unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan areas, and many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment, at the end of August. Also notable, 11 of the top 15 MSAs experienced declining unemployment rates in the last three months. The auto industry is still strong and is a major economic contributor within our footprint, but the housing markets are also strong. Labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016 with several markets such as here in Columbus, where we are at structural full employment. We are seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan continue to outpace overall U.S. growth, since the recovery. We remain confident in our footprint Midwest economies, based on the sustained job growth and economic production since the recovery that began after The Great Recession. Turning to slide 14, I'd like to give you some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through the cycle, shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long-term, and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As you heard Mac mention earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides what we believe is an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We're committed to and progressing as planned toward realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition. We continue to win new customers through a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. The new customers and dynamic markets offers, from the FirstMerit acquisition, provide a deeper and more vibrant pool to deliver our value proposition and add customers and deepen relationships. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively among the largest shareholders of Huntington. We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital. Looking forward to full year 2016 results, excluding the impact of significant items, we expect total revenues to increase 16% to 18% and noninterest expenses to increase 13% to 15%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We expect the asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. And consistent with our historical practice, we anticipate we'll provide initial expectations for 2017 at an investor conference later this quarter. Finally, we are very pleased with the smooth integration process with FirstMerit, which we acquired on August 16. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Canton, Ohio market will occur this quarter. We've completed the onboarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February of 2017. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress, as our IT teams have completed all product and data mapping and are now managing system testing and preparing for mock conversions. So now, I'll turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Thank you. Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then, if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers. Please state your firm. Your line is open. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning, guys. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Good morning, Scott. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Scott. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey. A quick question on the provision. Mac, I appreciate the color on the roughly $10 million or so of provision that might have been kind of unusual related to the move of loans for held-for-sale. But, I was hoping you might be able to give just a little more color on rationale behind such an elevated provision. And kind of whether or not, I guess, (24:13) to exclude the $10 million going forward if something in the $55 million range represents kind of a new customer elevated run rate, that has been the case more recently. So just, I guess, really any color that you can provide, please. Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Sure. Scott, this is Dan. So, there's a couple of things going on in the quarter. First, we did have higher charge-offs than what we have been experiencing although still below our long-term expectations. So, replenishing the $40 million of charge-offs was one piece of that. Second, as you've already noted, we had the movement of loans to held-for-sale. We also had the organic originations from FirstMerit post-closing. So, the new loans that are generated have allowance associated with them. And then, we did have a portfolio where we had a positive rate mark that offset the credit mark. So, it's recorded at a premium. So, we have allowance build there. So, I wouldn't say that this is a situation where this is the new normal. I think, this was a bit of an outlier and I think on a go-forward basis, we will have provision expense that is more in line with charge-offs and with an allowance for some growth. I also would note that, in the quarter, charge-offs were up partially due to the fact that we had lower recoveries in the C&I portfolio. That added about $5 million of additional charge-off over what we have been experiencing. So, we had quite a number of factors that would have resulted in the higher provision this quarter. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: And, Scott, I think this is where we see the volatility that we've been talking about in terms of charge-offs because of the low levels that we're running at. As Dan mentioned, it's a credit or two on the commercial side without the recoveries to offset that. So, clearly, the volatility is as we expected. And I would say that there's probably about $12 million that Dan mentioned associated with the loans held-for-sale and kind of the date to FirstMerit provision for the portfolios that he mentioned that had higher interest marks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: And, Scott, just one other comment. I think just as you're looking at it go-forward, the asset quality metrics in terms of the criticized, we had a reduction in nonaccruals, et cetera. So, very steady delinquencies. So there's nothing out there that would indicate that we expect a turn here, so, just in terms of you thinking about provisioning going forward. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. Okay. That's good color. Thank you guys very much. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey. Please state your firm. Your line is open. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. With FBR. I wanted to touch base on net interest margin. Is the 11 basis points some sort of one-time thing from accelerated pay-offs on acquired loans or is this more the level that we'll just gradually amortize lower over time? And then maybe could you sort of tell us what the margin was in the month of September, so we can think about a starting point headed into the fourth quarter? Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, Bob, I would think about that core margin as being 3.04% \u2013 3.06% absent of purchase accounting impact and it's two basis points for the interest recovery that we had in the quarter that added two basis points to it. There probably was about $4 million or $5 million in the quarter related to accelerated accretion for early pay-offs and those types of things. But, I think, thinking about the rest of it from a purchase accounting perspective and thinking about projecting that forward would be the right way to think about it. We are comfortable with the core margin staying above 3% for the remainder of the year. And I think it's also important to note that, on a core basis, FirstMerit was accretive to the core margin simply because of asset mix and the fact that they brought more DDA to the funding mix as well. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. And I guess, given the full quarter impact next quarter, so should we really be thinking about something above the 3.04% on a core basis? And do you know sort of what the core was, I guess, at the end of the quarter as we head into the fourth? Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. I think 3.04% is the right way to think about the core. The purchase accounting piece is a bit difficult because of what could happen from an accelerated accretion perspective, but I think you're pretty safe thinking about that core of 3.04%. Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos. Your line is open. Please state your firm. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : JPMorgan. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I wanted to first follow-up on Steve's comments regarding the customer acquisition and cross-sell strategies being under review. Do you guys currently use sales orders in the incentive comp calculation for branches, frontline folks? And do you think you'll need to more broadly change the incentive systems? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: We don't anticipate any meaningful change in incentive systems. There are certain things that we measure top of the house that are not pushed down at the account level, so \u2013 or at the officer level. So, that would include \u2013 we focus our branches and officers on revenue, not product-specific or product required sales, Steven. So, we don't anticipate any meaningful change on the incentive plans from where we are now. And I do think we'll put more sort of oversight and analysis in, but we've already been doing a fair amount of that. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up. A lot of moving pieces to the loan balances in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of what organic loan growth looked like in the quarter if we just think about Huntington on its own, maybe adjusting out some of the movements in the held-for-sale? Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yes. So, Steven, it'd be about 8% year-over-year, and it would be the categories that we've talked about previously that were driving the growth. It's indirect auto, its equipment financing, at least, on the Huntington side. I think we continue to see good pipelines on the commercial side of the business. And, I think, resi probably had some growth in the quarter as well. So, those were the categories that have been good for us this year. And the 8% is not out of balance, maybe a little bit higher than where we've been so far quarter-by-quarter this year. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Pipelines look strong at this point as we go into the fourth quarter in those categories, Steven, as well. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin. Please state your firm. Your line is open. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Ken from Jefferies. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Mac, I was wondering if you could walk us a little bit through the landing point for the balance sheet, meaning that it looks like you've got a whole bunch of pending and future loan sales. You got the divestitures. You've got core growth going on. And so, where do you see kind of pro forma ending up maybe as a fourth quarter start point, just so we can understand once you've moved through some of this additional clean-up underneath as a base. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Let's see if there might be a page we can direct you to in the deck. I mean, if you take a look at page 30 of the slide deck, might be the best place to look. It's September 30 balance sheet. It's on the asset side. And you can see that total commercial loans sort of about $35 billion at a spot basis, consumer about $31.4 billion and total loans and leases are about $66 billion. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Right. So, with the pending sales, though, does that \u2013 that's in the loans or in \u2013 already moved to the held-for-sale, right? So, period-end, we should think about that whole loans for-sale bucket going away and then you use the what's left kind of as the new base for loans? Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Exactly. So, you can see loans held-for-sale about four or five lines down there at $3.4 billion. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, those were already taken out. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Okay. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, those are actually \u2013 yes. Go ahead. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : No. That's fine. Then, just in terms of just your \u2013 the rest of liquidity and any changes to your funding mix going forward? What do you \u2013 do you anticipate continuing to build the securities book or is that now on a pro forma basis also in the right zone? Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: The securities book will go up a bit from here, because we are going to replace the auto loans with zero weighted risk-weighted assets. So, think about maybe another $2 billion or so in securities. So, that will come on, some others have already come on, some will come on in the fourth quarter as well. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: From a funding perspective, for the other loans that we're going to sell, we're going to pay down funding sources. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Well, I wouldn't see any material change in the way we're going to fund the balance sheet. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you guys. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Ken, some of the puts and takes on the restructuring are on slide seven, the optimization. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Is that good, Ken? Did we gave you what you need? Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Morning. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Ken. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just have a question on the auto side. Obviously, you reduced the concentration limits. You guys want to hold. You want to do more securitizations. How much of that relates to the environment that we're in for auto? Like are you seeing any deterioration in the broader industry auto credit that's leaving you to get more conservative? Thanks. Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Ken, this is Dan. We've commented on the past that we observe what's going on in the marketplace, but it really doesn't impact our business model or our performance. So we have not changed our view on the auto portfolio at all. And as we referenced in the slides, we continue to show our history of performance in originations. Haven't moved off that. We don't have a change in our go-forward view of what we believe we're going to experience. So, while there may be activities going out in the market that are of concern, because of our prime, super-prime focus, because of our strong origination scores, absence of risk layering, we have not changed our view at all with regard to the quality of the portfolio. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. No, that helps. And then, just to be clear on the comment you guys made, if I understood the prepared remarks correctly, I thought I heard you said that you're reducing the limit to the $150 million because sort of \"you can't originate enough to get you up to $175 million.\" Did I \u2013 I just want to make sure I fully understand the rationale of why your limits are going down. Thanks. Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, yes. So, the $175 million was put in place before we had an agreement with FirstMerit. So, it was put in place on a smaller capital base and we define capital as Tier 1 capital plus the allowance. So, there really wasn't an ability for us to get to the $175 million. We're not going to be a national player in auto. We like the geography that we're in. We like the business model that we have in place. We're not going to change the underwriting or the risk profile. And, quite frankly, as we bring on FirstMerit, we have other opportunities to invest capital at higher returns. So that's primarily why we did it. We've always been at $150 million historically, and we just feel that operating at $125 million gives us flexibility to perhaps go over $125 million from a timing perspective, if we're getting the securitization done. And if we don't like the market conditions, we can hold this above $125 million until we like the market conditions. So, that's the way we're thinking about it. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Okay. The third quarter was highlighted by the closing of FirstMerit acquisition and our continued strong financial performance. With sound fundamentals in place, we're well-positioned for solid performance in the coming quarters. And our strategies are working. Our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet. The addition of FirstMerit's solid balance sheet, strong credit performance, valuable customer base and dynamic new markets provide opportunity to further augment or accelerate the achievement of our long-term financial goals. Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priority is integrating FirstMerit and growing our core business while managing risks, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent long-term performance. So, thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thank you, Melissa, and welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO, and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call. As noted on slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the information and assumptions available at this time, and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let's get started by turning to slide 3 and an overview of the financials for 2016. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. 2016 was a transformational year for Huntington. As you know, we closed the acquisition of FirstMerit in the third quarter, and much of our efforts since close has been focused on ensuring a smooth and seamless integration. We are extremely pleased with the progress we're making in bringing the two companies together as one. As evidenced by fourth-quarter results, we're already seeing significant benefit in our efficiency ratio and return on tangible common equity. And we are looking forward to introducing the distinctive Huntington brand to the Chicago and Wisconsin markets later this quarter, helping to accelerate our long-term growth rate. All of our colleagues are engaged and excited by the opportunities in front of us in 2017 and longer term. Before we move to the detailed financials, I want to provide a few quick comments on the integration. As Steve will discuss later in the call, we are ahead of schedule, as we completed a number of significant milestones in the fourth quarter. Our new colleagues are embracing our fair play philosophy and welcome culture, and they are excited to have access to Huntington's more robust product set and capabilities. We're very pleased with our progress thus far, but we know the work is not yet finished. We are focusing on achieving flawless execution with the conversion, resulting in minimal disruption for our customers and the acceleration of our long-term financial goals. With that in mind, let's move to slide 3 and discuss the full-year 2016 financials. As I mentioned, 2016 was a transformational year for Huntington, and there were acquisition-related significant items which affected bottom-line results. I want to emphasize that legacy Huntington performance, including our net interest margin, operating leverage and balance sheet growth, continued to meet if not exceed our expectations in 2016. We delivered core revenue growth well within the range of our long-term goal, positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year and a NIM greater than 3% for each quarter of 2016. As I walk through our results for full year 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2016, please note that comparisons to previous periods are inclusive of FirstMerit. Huntington recorded earnings per common share of $0.67 for full-year 2016. This is inclusive of $0.20 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics that I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $6.41. Return on tangible common equity was 10.2%, while return on assets was 0.82%. Full-year revenue increased 18%, which included 11% growth in non-interest income. Full-year non-interest expense grew 24%, although after adjusting for FirstMerit's acquisition expense, full-year non-interest expense growth was 13%. Average total loans grew 18% for the full year, while average core deposit growth fully funded loan growth also increasing by 18% year over year. Credit quality remained strong in 2016. Consistent prudent credit underwriting as one of Huntington's core principles, and 2016's financial results continue to reflect that. Net charge-offs were 19 basis points of loans, relatively flat from 2015, while remaining well below our long-term financial goal of 35 to 55 basis points. The NPA ratio decreased 7 basis points from year end 2015. We managed the bank with an aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite, and our results illustrate this disciplined focus. Finally, our capital ratios declined midyear, as we effectively deployed capital via the acquisition of FirstMerit. Assisted by the balance sheet optimization strategy that we detailed on the third quarter earnings call and that was completed in the fourth quarter, we have strengthened our capital ratios since acquisition close. And as of yearend 2016, our CET1 ratio was 9.53%, well within our 9% to 10% operating guideline. Moving to slide 4, let's take a look at some of the financial metrics for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with the year-ago quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings per share was $0.18, inclusive of $0.06 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition. Also including the impact of significant items, ROA was 0.84% and return on tangible common equity was 11.4%. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 39%, with net interest income up 48% and non-interest income up 23%. Non-interest expense increased 45% from the year-ago quarter. Although adjusted for significant items, non-interest expense growth was 29%. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.4%. However, FirstMerit related acquisition expense added 8.8 percentage points to the efficiency ratio in the quarter. The reconciliation for this number can be found on slide 18. The efficiency ratio also benefited from $7.5 million of net hedging activity on mortgage servicing rights, a $5.6 million gain on our November auto loan securitization. $5 million of gains on the sale of loans resulting from our balance sheet optimization strategy, and a $6.5 million benefit from the extinguishment of trust preferred securities, as well as the impact of normal fourth-quarter seasonality. Moving on to the balance sheet, average total loans for the fourth quarter grew 33% year over year. Average core deposits grew 40% year over year, once again, fully funding loan growth. Fourth-quarter net charge-offs were 26 basis points, up 8 basis points from a year ago. Again, this remains below our long-term financial goal, and is consistent with our outlook of gradual reversion to our long-term range of 35 to 55 basis points. Turning to slide 5, let's take a closer look at the income statement. Fourth-quarter revenue was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Primarily driven by net interest income, which was up 48%, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and disciplined organic loan growth. The net interest margin was 3.25% for the fourth quarter, up 16 basis points from a year ago and up 7 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 18 basis points on the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, net interest income increased 23% year over year. Non-interest expense increased 45%, but adjusted for significant items, non-interest expense in the fourth quarter grew 29% from the year-ago quarter. For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations contained on pages 16 and 17 of the presentation slides or in the release. While we're on the subject of expenses, I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the FirstMerit acquisition. All the cost savings have been identified, and we have already realized roughly 50% of our cost savings goal. We expect to realize the majority of the remainder of the cost savings during the branch and systems conversion over Presidents' Day weekend next month. In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches at conversion or roughly 9% of the combined post divestiture branch network. Recall that there is a significant amount of overlap in the two branch networks, as 39% of legacy FirstMerit branches are within one mile of Huntington branches. In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating nine legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter. Slide 6 shows the expected pretax net impact of purchase accounting adjustments on an annual forward-looking basis. We introduced this slide at a recent conference, and we think it will be useful in helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion, and do not include any projected accelerated accretion from early payoffs or renewals. Therefore since in reality we're likely to experience some level of early payoffs and accelerated accretion, just as we already did in 3Q of 2016 and 4Q of 2016, you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars pulled forward as early payoffs occur. Some of the accelerated accretion may be offset by provision expense, as acquired FirstMerit loans renew and we establish a loan-loss reserve in normal course. As a result, we intend to provide regular updates of this schedule going forward until the majority of the purchase accounting accretion has been recognized. Slide 7 illustrates the achievement of positive operating leverage for full-year 2016. Of course we talk about this every quarter, and stress how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. In 2016, we enjoyed our fourth consecutive year of positive operating leverage, realizing adjusted revenue growth of 17.8% which outpaced adjusted expense growth of 13.1%. As you know, annual positive operating leverage is one of our long-term financial goals. We contained our target positive operating leverage on an annual basis, and we have budgeted to meet this goal for the fifth consecutive year in 2017. Turning to slide 8, let's look at balance sheet trends. As you look at the left of the slide, you can see that the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. Recall the last quarter, we announced certain actions to optimize the balance sheet in order to improve capital efficiency and flexibility. With that in mind, during the fourth quarter, we completed a $1.5 billion auto securitization and invested the proceeds into 0% risk-weighted securities. We also repositioned approximately $2 billion of higher risk-weighted securities into 0% risk-weighted securities. Finally, we sold almost $1 billion of non-relationship C&I and CRE loans. Completing all announced actions during the fourth quarter, added approximately 41 basis points to CET1 at year end, positioning us well for the 2017 CCAR cycle. Turning back to fourth-quarter performance, average earning assets grew 41% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 54% increase in average securities, and a 37% increase in average C&I loans. The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit's portfolio, the reinvestment of cash flows and additional investments in liquidity coverage ratio level one qualifying securities. The increase in C&I loans primarily reflected FirstMerit as well as increases in the automobile core plan and corporate banking loans. Average auto loans increased 17% year over year, with the acquired $1.5 billion FirstMerit portfolio essentially offsetting the impact of the $1.5 billion securitization. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.25% in the fourth quarter, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter and up almost 35 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Turning to the right side of slide 8, I want to call attention to the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase on low-cost DDA. Average total deposits increased 39% from the year-ago quarter, including a 40% increase in average core deposits. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit's low-cost deposit base. It has been almost two full quarters since the acquisition closed, and we are extremely pleased with customer and deposit retention. Our net interest margin was 3.25% for the fourth quarter, up 16 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected a 23 basis point increase in earning asset yields, balanced against the 7 basis point increase in funding costs. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 7 basis points, driven by an 8 basis point improvement in earning asset yields. Purchase accounting contributed 18 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. After adjusting for this impact, the core NIM was 3.07, up 1 basis point from the third quarter of 2016. Also adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, the fourth quarter NIM includes 1 basis point favorable impact related to one large interest recovery. Recall our core NIM included two basis points of favorable impact last quarter. Slide 10 illustrates the progress we have made in rebuilding our regulatory capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. CET1 [indiscernible] the quarter at 9.53%, down 26 basis points year over year and up 44 basis points from the previous quarter. We mentioned previously that our operating guideline for CET1 is 9% to 10%. We are very pleased to have reached the mid-point level only one quarter following the close of the FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 68 basis points year over year and flat linked quarter. Moving to slide 11, for the fourth quarter, we booked provision expense of $75 million compared to net charge-offs of $44 million. The higher provision expense was due to several factors, including the migration of FirstMerit loans from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio, portfolio growth and transitioning the FirstMerit portfolio to Huntington's reserving methodology. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases consistent with the prior quarter, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The ACL as a percentage of loans increased to 1.10% from 1.06% at the end of the third quarter, while the non-accrual loan coverage ratio remained stable at 174%. Asset-quality metrics were largely favorable in the quarter. The NPA ratio remained flat at 72 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly from 3.54% to 3.62%, driven largely by risk rating calibration within the FirstMerit book which increased our OLEM loans in the quarter. Importantly, substandard loans, the most severe category of problem loans, actually decreased in the quarter due to pay downs and refinancings. Also of note, 58% of our non-performing commercial loans remain current. Other indicators of credit quality include very low 90-day delinquencies at 19 basis points, and lower NPA inflows in the quarter. I will now turn the presentation over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Mac. Moving to the economy, slide 13 contains what we believe to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. A footprint that has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our eight core Midwestern states. And as you can see, despite a leveling off of economic growth during recent periods, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average. The charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. I want to call particular pretension to the bottom chart which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of November. This is the chart we look to for insights into expected future growth within our footprint, and as you can see the chart shows that all eight states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next six months. Turning to slide 14, it also focuses on trends in unemployment rates, but specifically for our largest Metropolitan markets. In many of the large MSAs, the footprint remained at or near 15-year lows for unemployment as of the end of November. The auto industry remains a major economic contributor within our footprint, housing markets are strong as well. Home price stability and affordability are some of the best in the nation right here in our footprint, and we continue to see broad-based home price growth in all of our footprint states. The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016, with several markets such as here in Columbus where we are at structural fullest employment. We are seeing wage inflation in our expense base, and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. The election is behind us and many of the businesses in our footprint have expressed optimism about a new business-friendly environment expected from the new administration and regulatory regime. Overall, the underlying trends and fundamentals remain strong. We are confident in our footprint Midwest economy, based on the sustained job growth and economic production. So with that, let's turn to slide 15 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low-risk profile throughout. And as you heard Mac mention earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We are progressing as planned toward realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition, with a significant portion of the planned savings, roughly half of them, already implemented. The majority of the remaining savings will be implemented during the branch conversion this quarter over the Presidents' Day weekend. We continue to win new customers through a strong distinguished brand with differentiated products and superior customer service across all of our businesses. Our new customers provide a deeper pool to deliver our value proposition and to fuel our growth. We are now five months past the close of the FirstMerit acquisition, and we have seen little attrition from the FirstMerit accounts. This is a testament to our emphasis on customer service, and the progress of our combined teams coming together. We have maintained momentum in our core businesses throughout the integration. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly within our customer facing teams and in mobile and digital technologies as well as data analytics. Importantly, we continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the Board, Management, our employees and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively amongst the largest shareholders of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares, and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder's capital. Looking towards 2017, we expect total revenue growth in excess of 20%. This includes an expected benefit from one rate hike around midyear of this year. We continue to target positive operating leverage on an annual basis. We will grow the average balance sheet in excess of 20%. We expect to fully implement all the cost savings from the FirstMerit acquisition by the third quarter of 2017. We believe asset quality metrics will remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Finally, we continue to be extremely pleased with the integration with FirstMerit and with the outstanding colleagues we have dedicated to a seamless conversion. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Canton, Ohio market, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2016, and we have completed the onboarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February, and our system conversion efforts continue to progress well. As you can see, it was an exciting quarter and indeed an exciting year. We are very focused on the future we're building. We have a lot of momentum across our businesses, and we're ready to build on the hard work that got us to this point. So I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you. Mark Muth : We will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Sounds like things are going well on the integration from the expense side, and what I was curious about was the revenue synergy piece. I know that you did not include that in the accretion guidance initially from the acquisition, but in your important messages, you are saying you were executing on the revenue synergies. So maybe give us an idea or an update in terms of how that's going so far? Mac McCullough : So, Jon, it's actually going very well. We are continuing to make investments into a number of areas, including SBA lending, home equity and home mortgage origination. And the other fact is that we are seeing really good acceptance and interest in capital markets products with the FirstMerit customer base, interest rates, revenues, foreign exchange, those types of things. So really good traction there as well. And then as we take FirstMerit's [indiscernible] portfolio and capabilities and expand that into our markets, and further we think that's a great growth opportunity. So if you add to that just from the performance that we've seen from a customer retention perspective, a deposit retention perspective with FirstMerit, I would tell you that we are really hitting on all cylinders there. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. And the other number that you laid out was a percentage of revenues from non-interest income, and if you raised the FirstMerit average to your average that there's more accretion in the acquisition. Anything that you see right now that would prevent you from hitting that corporate average? Mac McCullough : No. We think that there's probably close to $100 million of revenue if you normalize FirstMerit's fee income to total revenue to ours. And we really have that identified in terms of where we think that's coming from, and we've got the incremental expenses and capabilities built into 2017 and 2018. So we feel pretty comfortable with achieving that number. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Usdin : Just a question on costs and efficiency progress to your clear points about getting to the cost saves run rated by the second half and the third quarter. And then also with this planned accretion runoff, just wondering if you can help us understand how you expect the efficiency ratio to traject? You have got that long-term goal 56%, 59%. Just wondering if think you can get inside of that by the end of next year? How are you thinking about exiting 4Q 2017 to your point moving -- you're still committing to positive operating leverage but with a lot of these moving parts back and forth? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Ken. So we are very comfortable with the range we have put out there the 56% to 59% longer term. And clearly as we start to see increases in interest rates, we do think that's going to help us get towards the bottom end of the range. We do go through system conversion branch closures in the February timeframe, and we will see the expense come out in the second quarter. There might be a little bit that will come out in the third quarter as well. So I would expect that in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll be a run rate that will certainly reflect the range that we've signed up for longer term. Ken Usdin : So you think you can get into the range. And I guess you've given the 20% revenue outlook on the top line, and I'm just wondering, I think we're all wondering just what that magnitude of operating leverage is that you were thinking through. Is there any way to help us understand like you did for the fourth quarter just around what you think the rate of expense growth will be versus that 20% plus on the top? Mac McCullough : We've come out and told you what we expect the fourth quarter expense number to be at a regional conference in the fourth quarter. So that's $609 million. Ken Usdin : Okay. So that's still on track? Mac McCullough : That's still on track. That gets us to the $255 million cost takeout we've signed up for growing at 3%, and achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Connor: Obviously some moving pieces on the NIM, the purchase accounting accretion was a lot better this quarter, but seems like the core NIM was also better. Wondering if you can help us shape what both components could look like in the first quarter of 2017? Mac McCullough : Yes, Matt, there are number of moving parts here. And as we discussed, the core NIM is 3.07, 3.06 if you exclude the interest recovery that we saw in the quarter. We do think the core NIM is going to expand from this point. We are 6% asset sensitive. We're going to continue to see the swap book on the asset side roll off. We have about a little over $3 billion in asset swaps that will come off by the end of the year, that will increase asset sensitivity by probably another 0.7, 0.8 and we did see some impact from the December rate increase. So I would suggest that it's going to be difficult to project the NIM because of the purchase accounting impact and some of the accelerated accretion. That we do expect to happen, that we have seen happen in both the third and fourth quarters. But feel good about the core margin expanding from this point. Matt O'Connor: And can you help size the impact of call it the 25 basis point increase in rates that we saw in December? Obviously the industry is not experiencing a lot of deposit repricing, so I think we are seeing more NIM left than expected from the first couple rate increases. But maybe just size how much benefit you expect to get from December's hike. Mac McCullough : We are assuming probably a 40% to 50% beta on that change. And I think as you play that through, it really is going to depend a lot on what happens with competition and how we see pricing change in the environment. So I don't think the impact of this first increase is going to be hugely material, but certainly it will be a positive to the margin going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : On the auto side, wanted to see if you can give us an update on some of the dynamics you are seeing there in the industry just given that we've been seeing some of the auto lenders see some volatility there? So just curious about the competitive dynamic, your appetite for ongoing growth there, maybe your growth outlook as well as credit trends how they are moving along. Thanks. Dan Neumeyer : This is Dan. So I would say in terms of the credit trends, we feel very good as we have stated in the past. What goes on in the market isn't completely relevant to what we are doing since we haven't adjusted our origination strategies in terms of FICO, LTV, term, et cetera. So we are still a prime, super prime lender and our results have been quite consistent. A lot of noise in what's going on in the market, but I think that relates more to those who are in the sub prime rate or near prime space. So we still see good originations, as Matt noted earlier, we actually saw some margin expansion. We think on a risk-adjusted basis, we are in a really -- in a great spot. So trends are good, delinquencies remain well controlled. So on the whole, very solid outlook. We continue to plan for more growth, but very steady origination strategy. Steve Steinour : And our expectation, John, is the dealers will continue to have a good year, roughly in line with last year. And we are very well-positioned in that regard, both on the direct side core plan, the indirect and to finance some of the supply base. And all that's broken out for you on the different schedules that we provide. Dan Neumeyer : And just I would add that there are a couple of items this quarter that are worth noting. So we do have the FirstMerit portfolio included. And so when you look at the charge-off numbers on page 46, we provide a table that outlines. They do have a higher charge-off rate, but part of that is impacted by the fact that recoveries do not reduce gross charge-offs. Because it's an acquired book, and therefore the recoveries flow through the income line. And so that's one factor to consider. The other thing is we had securitization. So we had $1.5 billion move out of the denominator, and there are no delinquencies in that pool of loans. So when you really make those adjustments, our originated book continues to be very steady, 1 to 2 basis points higher than last year. Either if you're looking at quarter over quarter, it was 1 basis point, year over year, 2 basis points. So again, very steady performance that we are very pleased with. John Pancari : And then, Steve, I just would love to get your thoughts on capital deployment here, and how you are thinking about deployment going into 2017 CCAR. Do you see an opportunity to get more aggressive there in returns, and how would you prioritize buybacks versus dividends? Thanks. Steve Steinour : Our capital priorities haven't changed from what we've had over the years, organic growth, dividend, and then other actions. The balance sheet optimization activities of the fourth quarter were all successfully completed, and that was with the view of giving us the capacity to come into CCAR with a strong foundation. The Board will make decisions later, we don't even have CCAR scenarios yet so it would be very premature for me to comment at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kyle Peterson : This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Bob today. It looks like your tax rate has been a little bit lower here. It looks like even when backing out the merger charges, it's running more in that 24%, 25% range. I just want to see if you guys could give any color moving forward on where we should expect that to run? Mac McCullough : That's pretty consistent with where we have been, and the guidance that we provide is in that same range I think 24% to 27% is what we said in the press release, and that excludes significant items. So when you tax back the significant items of 35%, it does make that rate look lower on a GAAP basis, but if you adjust for the significant items, you get to the 25%. And if you actually FTE adjusted that, it would actually be higher. But that's a range we're very comfortable with going forward. Kyle Peterson : Okay, great. Then I guess just a little bit on margin. I know you guys mentioned your guidance includes a rate hike in the middle of the year. Where do you guys see the core margin going in the event of no additional rate hikes throughout the year? Mac McCullough : Higher. We're going to see the core margin continue to expand. Again, it's not going to be hugely significant, but we have talked about probably one to two rate hikes requiring to take place in order for us to start to see margin expansion. And we actually think we're going to get that with the one rate hike now. And again, March will be a bit volatile this year because of what's happening with purchase accounting and accelerated accretion. But we'll be sure to keep you informed in terms what we see there an update it as it rolls through. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Mac, I was hoping you could expand on your comments on the nuance of the purchase accounting pull forward. Just curious specifically on slide 6 if you can walk through the changes and what drove those relative to when you guys had given that slide out at the Goldman conference last month. Just kind of curious, is that just initial behavior of the acquired portfolio or what changed in that time period? Mac McCullough : Scott, so the best way to think about it is if a loan pays off and it renews early, then we accelerate the purchase accounting adjustment and that comes into the margin. That happened in the fourth quarter to the tune of about $10 million. Scott Siefers : Okay. Mac McCullough : Okay. So what you have to also realize the flip side of that, as an acquired loan moves from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio we have to establish a reserve for that. So in the fourth quarter, roughly half of the increase or of the reserve build is due to acquired loans from FirstMerit being in the originated portfolio. So we are going to continue to see accelerated accretion in the margin, and we're going to continue to see some higher provision expense as we've reserved for those loans that come into the originated book. Scott Siefers : Okay. Mac McCullough : That's where it gets a little complex, and we can't actually predict what is going to renew on a forward basis. But we will give you this chart every quarter updated for what's happened, and let you know what the inflows and outflows are. Steve Steinour : Scott, if I could just add to try and -- normally, you would expect to see renewal activity first and second quarter on these commercial loans. So we're trying to share with you an expectation that there will be, in addition to scheduled maturities, there will be we think just more economic activity associated with the outlook, the improved outlook. Expansions of working capital lines, maybe more CapEx, things like that, so we could be in a period that's more active than what we've had recently as we go through the first half of 2017. Scott Siefers : Okay, that all makes sense. Thank you. And then was just curious as well, I think when you originally gave the guidance for 2017 on that 20% plus revenue growth, that was assuming no rate increases either the one we got in December or anything this year. So would the 20% still hold true even if we got nothing else? And just out of curiosity, you guys have always been so conservative on the rate outlook with basically always assuming none. Just curious why you decided to add even just the one into the outlook? Mac McCullough : Scott, I think the guidance still holds true. We just felt that it feels more certain this time, and that it just made more sense from a reality perspective and how we've built out the budget and how we thought about 2017. So we did put the one additional increase in midyear, and that's rolling through our budget for 2017. Scott Siefers : Okay. Steve Steinour : And, Scott, like prior years, we have contingent expense reduction should we find the environment to be different than we anticipate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : I wanted to ask a question on how given that rate hikes could potentially be more certain in 2017 and especially beyond, I'm wondering if you could help us think about how your asset sensitivity could have changed with the FirstMerit acquisition now fully in your books for the next rate hike? So in 1Q of 2016, your margin went up 2 basis points. And I'm wondering given the comments on a potentially structurally higher NIM anyway, core NIM in 2017, plus the 25 basis point rate hike, plus the fact your deposit costs haven't moved. Whether the expansion quarter over quarter in core NIM is likely going to be greater than the 2 basis points in 1Q 2016? Mac McCullough : So, Erika, the FirstMerit balance sheet actually didn't change our asset sensitivity or interest rate risk significantly. So if anything, FirstMerit might have been a little bit more asset sensitive. So we don't really think that this has had a huge impact on how we are positioned, either before or after the FirstMerit acquisition. And clearly, it's all going to depend on what happens in the marketplace and what happens with the competition. We're in a new environment for liquidity based on new regulations and requirements. And certainly when the first rate hikes come through on an increasing cycle, you typically don't see as much of up pricing on the deposit side as quickly. We might be conservative with the 40% to 50% beta in what we are assuming. But we feel comfortable with those assumptions, and we are going to continue to monitor what's happening in the environment just to make sure that we are competitive from a liquidity perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. David Long : I just wanted to see if you guys can talk a little bit about your strategy on the retail banking side in your newly-acquired Chicago market here after the FirstMerit deal? In the Chicago market, you guys may not have the critical mass like several of the competent larger banks here. Just want to see how you plan to compete, and then also how you'd look to invest in that market in the future? Steve Steinour : David, we have outlined it and I will try and cover this again. Mac may want to add to it. We've outlined that we will continue with the strategy that FirstMerit had, which was a niche approach emphasizing commercial or business lending. We have made a commitment to SBA lending in Chicago, and the team largely is in place now, the same with home lending. With our mortgage capabilities, we've added significantly. We are continuing to add at this point into our Chicago team on the mortgage front. So we like our distribution in terms of the spread. It's not concentrated given the size of that market. It's obviously grossly under scale, and that will cause us to focus on these niches and growing these niches and perhaps growing in some other areas over time. But the emphasis will be to maintain the disciplined that FirstMerit had in terms of growing commercial lending activities in Chicago principally. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Terry McEvoy : I just wanted to circle back to Ken's question on that 4Q expense target of $609 million. If I remember that presentation last quarter, it did not include some personnel expenses, the FDIC insurance premiums. And I'm wondering if you could help us with the GAAP number, and also just the amortization as well to better understand what 4Q could look like again from a GAAP standpoint? Mac McCullough : Yes, Terry. So the $609 million does not include intangible amortization. That's a number excluding that figure. And certainly the $609 million is a quantitative measurement looking at the $255 million growing at 3%. And we're making investments in revenue-producing capabilities, personnel, technology basically for FirstMerit markets where we have additional opportunities. We've talked about SBA, we've talked about home lending. And we will be adding some expense relative to those investments without a doubt, but we will also be adding revenue associated with those investments too. So certainly, the $609 million as we get closer to that we will reconcile in terms of what those investments look like. But feel very comfortable that we're going to get the cost takeouts that we have signed up for, and we're going to make additional investments into revenue opportunities that we think are available to us. Terry McEvoy : And then earlier you said for the most part, you'd get the full cost saves by the end of 2Q, with a little bit moving into Q3. Could you be a little more specific in terms of what you expect to realize by the middle point of 2017? Mac McCullough : It's going to depend a bit on how we move through the conversion and integration process. There's still some expenses that we are working to get out that might be more longer term in nature around real estate and those types of things. To the extent anything bleeds into the third quarter, I don't expect it to be material but there will be some third-quarter impact. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Barker : I just wanted to follow up in regards to some of the questions around capital. Your CET1 ratio obviously appears to have very healthy and plenty of excess capital to be deployed over time, but it seems like your TCE ratio is relatively low compared to the peer group. Are you comfortable bringing down the TCE ratio below 7% as long as you have the CET1 ratio well above an 8% ratio? Mac McCullough : Kevin, it's Mac. So we are focused on CET1, and we do have an operating range of 9% to 10% for CET1. As you see, the 9.50% which is where we are today calibrates, translates to a 7.2% TCE. We do monitor the tangible common ratio. It is something that we pay close attention to. I'm not sure I see it going below 7%, but it certainly is calibrated to CET1 and that's the ratio that ratio that we're really focused on. Kevin Barker : And then you're obviously building the provision given the purchase accounting accretion that's coming off of FirstMerit, and you will probably see that continue to grow. How long -- at what point do you feel like you would be at a more normalized level in a reserve to loan ratio, and how long do you think it will take to get to that point following the FirstMerit acquisition? Mac McCullough : Kevin, I would probably refer you to slide 6 in terms of what the accretion around purchase accounting. Basically as the acquired portfolio moves into an originated portfolio as those loans renew, we will see the purchase accounting adjustments decline. And you will see us over that period of time replenishing the reserve, building a reserve, on those loans as they move from acquired to organic. So clearly, what you see on slide 6 would be an elongated view because we're going to see this pull forward as loans renew early. So I would just ask you to think about slide 6 and calibrate around the numbers on that page, understanding that it's going to be accelerated. Kevin Barker : Okay. And when you think about the risk profile pro forma on the FirstMerit acquisition, do you feel that your reserve to loan ratio should run higher than it was in the past or do you feel like it could run a little bit lower than what it was in previous quarters prior to the acquisition? Mac McCullough : I think as we move towards normalization, you are probably going to be a little bit higher than previously. That's what I would say. Because just our base charge-off level, we still remain below the long-term target but we are definitely moving towards more normalization as recoveries decrease. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with KBW. Please proceed with your question. Brian Klock : I wanted to follow up just really quickly, Mac, on an earlier question about the deposit beta assumptions. I think you said 40% to 50%, is that what you're expecting from the December hike that just happened in 2016 or is that what your asset sensitivity assumptions are or is that yes to both? Mac McCullough : That would be us to both. Brian Klock : Okay. Mac McCullough : So the 40% to 50% is average across the entire deposit portfolio, and we have been pretty consistent in talking about a 50% beta over time. And as we think about the December hike, we have modeled something in that range. Brian Klock : Okay. And then I guess a follow-up question. Steve, you mentioned some of the improved commercial sentiment post election. Actually you guys in the fourth quarter your C&I loan growth was pretty solid relative to some others that we've seen softness in middle market. So maybe you can talk about what kind of trends you're seeing in the C&I book? And is there that potential for some enhanced an increase capital expenditures that may actually finally happen in the Midwest? Steve Steinour : I think the early read from many of our customers is one of more optimism. And what they are telling us and what are more broadly our various line management and RMs are telling us is much more activity compared to prior periods in terms of potential investments. So we are I think better positioned than we have been for maybe a decade in terms of CapEx and expansion in the different businesses here in the Midwest. Brian Klock : And if I could throw one more in. I don't know, Mac, do you have the growth you did get in loans this quarter from FirstMerit versus HPN? Mac McCullough : I don't have that. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Thank you all again. 2016 was highlighted by the acquisition of FirstMerit, and our continued strong core financial performance. We are encouraged by the focused activities of our colleagues and the sentiment of our customers. With sound fundamentals in place at the start of the year, we are positioned for solid performance in the coming quarters. Clearly, our strategies are working and our execution of goals continues to drive good results. We expect to continue to gain market share and grow share of wallet. The addition of FirstMerit's solid balance sheet, strong credit performance, valuable customer base and new markets provide opportunities for us to further accelerate achievement of our long-term financial goals. We're already realizing revenue synergies in several areas. And finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this Management Team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priority is integrating FirstMerit and growing our core business. At the same time, we will continue to manage risks and volatility and do so with the intent of driving solid, consistent long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. Mark Muth : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com, by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO, and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call.  As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.  Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 3 and an overview of the first quarter financials. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Mark, and thanks to everyone joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by saying we are very pleased with what we accomplished in the first quarter. Not only did we deliver solid core financial performance, we\u2019ve materially completed the FirstMerit systems conversion and branch consolidations over President\u2019s Day weekend. As Steve will discuss later in the call, both the systems conversion and branch consolidations went very well, and we remain on pace to deliver the expected cost savings and the incremental revenue enhancement opportunities. We continue to expect that the economics of the FirstMerit acquisition will accelerate the achievement of our long-term financial goals. As I discuss first quarter results, please keep in mind that all year-over-year comparisons will benefit from the inclusion of FirstMerit, as the acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2016. With that in mind, let me dive into the financials. On Slide 3, Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.17 for the first quarter of 2017. This is inclusive of $0.04 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics that I will highlight on this slide. Return on assets was 0.84%, return on common equity was 8.2%, and return on tangible common equity was 11.3%. The net interest margin was 3.30%, up 19 basis points year-over-year and 5 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Tangible book value per share decreased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $6.55.  Total revenue increased $300 million or 40% year-over-year, which included 45% growth in net interest income and 29% growth in non-interest income. Non-interest expense increased $216 million or 44% year-over-year. Non-interest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $149 million or 31% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and ongoing investments in technology and our colleagues. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.7%; however, net acquisition related expense added 6.7 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. The reconciliation for this number can be found on Slide 16. Moving onto the balance sheet, average total loans grew 32% year-over-year while average core deposit growth, fully funded loan growth increasing 39% year-over-year. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles and our financial results continue to reflect that. Net charge-offs were 24 basis points of average loans, remaining well below our long-term financial goal of 35 to 55 basis points. This is up from 7 basis points in the year-ago quarter but down slightly from 26 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-performing asset ratio decreased by 34 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from the impact of purchase accounting and the acquired portfolio. We managed the bank with an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and our results illustrate this disciplined focus. Finally, our capital ratios continue to increase modestly. As of quarter end, our CET1 ratio was 9.67%, well within our 9% to 10% operating guideline, while our TCE ratio was 7.28%.  Turning to Slide 4, let\u2019s take a closer look at the income statement. First quarter revenue was up 40% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by net interest income which was up 45%, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and disciplined organic loan growth. The net interest margin was 3.30% for the fourth quarter, up 19 basis points from a year ago and up 5 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 16 basis points on the net interest margin in the first quarter compared to 18 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-interest income increased 29% year-over-year driven by mortgage, trust services and card and payment processing.  Non-interest expense increased 44% year-over-year. Significant items again impacted both the first quarters of 2017 and 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, acquisition related expense totaled $73 million. Adjusted non-interest expense for the first quarter grew 31% from the year-ago quarter. For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations on Page 15 of the presentation slides or in the release. We remain on track to achieve the $255 million of annual expense savings that were communicated when we announced the FirstMerit acquisition. In total, we consolidated 110 branches during the first quarter or roughly 10% of the branch network. We consolidated 101 branches at systems conversion. In addition, as part of our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we consolidated nine legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter. Slide 5 shows the expected pre-tax net impact of purchase accounting adjustments on an annual forward-looking basis. We introduced this slide last fall and believe it is useful in helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion and, except for what we actually experienced in the first quarter of 2017, do not include any accelerated accretion from early payoffs in the projected periods.  As our results for the past three quarters illustrate, in reality we are likely to experience loan modifications and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion, therefore you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars continue to be pulled forward as modifications and early payoffs occur. Let me also remind you that some of the accelerated accretion may be offset by provision expense as acquired FirstMerit loans renew and we establish a loan loss reserve in the normal course. As a result, we intend to continue to provide regular updates of this schedule going forward until the majority of the purchase accounting accretion has been recognized. Slide 6 illustrates that we are off to a positive start with respect to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2017. Of course, we talk about this every quarter and stress how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. In 2016, we enjoyed our fourth consecutive year of positive operating leverage and we are confident that 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year. Turning to Slide 7, let\u2019s look at balance sheet trends. Average earning assets grew 38% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 57% increase in average securities and a 35% increase in average C&I loans. The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit\u2019s portfolio, the reinvestment of cash flows including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the fourth quarter, and additional investments in liquidity coverage ratio Level 1 qualifying securities. The increase in average C&I loans primarily reflected the FirstMerit acquisition as well as increases in core middle market, the specialty lending verticals, business banking, and auto core plan. Offsetting some of this growth, we saw large corporate borrowers pay down their bank debt by tapping the debt markets in order to lock in current low rates. Average auto loans increased 14% year-over-year with the acquired $1.5 billion FirstMerit portfolio essentially offsetting the impact of the $1.5 billion securitization in the fourth quarter. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.54% in the first quarter, up approximately 25 basis points from the prior quarter and up about 50 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Average residential mortgage loans increased 29% year-over-year as we continue to see strong demand for mortgages across our footprint. Turning attention to the chart on the right side of Slide 7, average total deposits increased 38% from the year-ago quarter, including a 39% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 60% year-over-year. I want to call your attention to the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase in low-cost DBA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit\u2019s low-cost deposit base. We continue to experience only modest core deposit attrition from the FirstMerit book, limited primarily to some rate-sensitive government deposits. Importantly, we are ahead of our original pro forma model with respect to retention of deposit balances. Moving to Slide 8, our net interest margin was 3.30% for the first quarter, up 19 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected a 26 basis point increase in earning asset yields and 1 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits balanced against an 8 basis point increase in funding costs. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 5 basis points driven by a 10 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and 1 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits partially offset by a 6 basis point increase in funding costs.  Purchase accounting contributed 16 basis points to the net interest margin in the first quarter, down from 18 basis points in the fourth quarter. After adjusting for this impact, the core net interest margin was 3.14% compared to 3.07% in the fourth quarter of 2016, also adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.  I would also like to call your attention to the orange line at the bottom of the graph on the left. This shows our cost of deposits, which was only 26 basis points for the first quarter. This represents a 2 basis point increase over the year-ago quarter, clearly illustrating the strong core deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing.  Slide 9 illustrates the continued progress we\u2019ve made in rebuilding our regulatory capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. CET1 ended the quarter at 9.67%, down 6 basis points year-over-year but up 9 basis points from the previous quarter. We have mentioned previously that our operating guideline for CET1 is 9% to 10%. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.28%, down 61 basis points year-over-year but up 14 basis points linked quarter.  Moving to Slide 10, we booked provision expense of $68 million in the first quarter compared to net charge-offs of $39 million. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 24 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains well below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down 2 basis points from the prior quarter and up 17 basis points from the year-ago quarter, which benefited from material commercial real estate recoveries.  The higher provision expense was due to several factors, including the migration of FirstMerit loans from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio, portfolio growth, and transitioning the FirstMerit portfolio to Huntington\u2019s reserve methodology. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased to 1.14% from 1.10% at year-end, and the non-accrual loan coverage ratio increased to 190%.  Asset quality metrics remained stable in the first quarter. The non-performing asset ratio eased 4 basis points to 68 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly from 3.62% to 3.72%. Our 90-day plus delinquencies remained flat. We also experienced lower NPA inflows for the second quarter in a row.  With that, let me turn the presentation over to Steve. Stephen Steinour : Thanks Mac. Moving to the economy, Slide 12 illustrates a few key economic indicators for our footprint. Our footprint has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery of the last several years, and I remain very bullish on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our footprint, and as you can see, unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint continue to trend favorably. The charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region.  I want to call particular attention to the bottom chart, which shows the leading indexes for our footprint as of January, which is the most recent data available. This is the chart we look to for insights into expected future growth within our footprint, and as you can see, the chart shows that seven of our eight states expect positive economic growth over the next six months. Slide 13 illustrates trends in the unemployment rates for our 10 largest deposit markets. Now, many of the large MSAs in our footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment as of the end of February. The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016 with several markets, such as here in Columbus and in Grand Rapids, where we\u2019re at structural full employment. We\u2019ve noted previously that we\u2019re seeing wage inflation in our expense base, and our customers are too. Housing markets across the footprint are strong, displaying home price stability and even increases while remaining some of the most affordable markets in the U.S. We continue to see broad-based home price appreciation in all of our footprint states. Consumers and businesses alike continue to express optimism about a more business-friendly environment expected from Washington. This optimism is broad-based and shows in our loan pipelines. I know there\u2019s been much focus for this quarter on the Federal Reserve H8 data and the lack of loan growth acceleration for the sector. For the past several years, we\u2019ve seen weak performance in the first quarter followed by building strength over the rest of the year, and based on the acceleration and growth of our pipeline during March, I\u2019m hopeful that this will prove to be the case again in 2017. That said, we continued to see reduced rates of pull-through from the pipeline to booked loans restraining our loan growth overall. Finally, most of our state and local governments continue to operate with surpluses.  With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 14 for some closing remarks and important messages. We started the year with good financial performance in the first quarter, but as always, we do not manage the bank around the quarterly earnings cycle. We manage for the long term and remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long term, and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. The integration of FirstMerit continues to progress very well. The branch and systems conversion went very well with no widespread issues or challenges. You probably do not have a good sense of just how much work was involved in the conversion, so I\u2019d like to share a few statistics. There were more than 1,000 colleagues involved and they converted more than 350 different systems. Over 750 terabytes of data were converted. We had 24 separate plans for conversion weekend, containing more than 17,000 tasks. We had more than 230 milestones over the weekend, and finally we mailed 1.2 million welcome kits, so it was truly a tremendous amount of hard work and our colleagues, I\u2019m proud to say, performed it very well. Now with almost all of our technology conversions complete, we are progressing as planned toward realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition, with more than three-fourths already implemented. We also remain on pace with our revenue enhancement opportunities, such as the SBA and home lending expansions in Chicago and Wisconsin, and the RV and marine lending expansions which we\u2019ve discussed at recent investor conferences. We have previously discussed some of the early wins we had in capital markets and insurance by bringing our superior product offering to the legacy FirstMerit customer base. We are delivering the promised financial benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition and believe you can already see the benefits in our underlying fundamentals. We approached the branch conversions with the mantra of retain and grow customer relationships and deposits, and I\u2019m very pleased with our success. When we announced the transaction, we shared that one of our assumptions in our model called for about 10% deposit runoff, and we\u2019re clearly outperforming that assumption.  We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly with our customer-facing teams and in mobile and digital technologies, as well as data analytics. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. Finally, we always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the fifth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We\u2019re highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders capital.  First quarter is now in the books, so it\u2019s time to look forward to the remainder of 2017. I\u2019ll ask you to note that our expectations for the full year 2017 are unchanged from what we shared with you at year end. We expect total revenue growth in excess of 20%. We continue to target positive operating leverage on an annual basis. We will grow the average balance sheet in excess of 20%. We expect to fully implement all the cost savings of the FirstMerit acquisition by the third quarter of 2017. We also expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you. Mark Muth : Thanks Steve. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up, and then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. Just a couple questions related to the merger. First of all, you mentioned, Steve, three quarters of the saves gotten through the conversion was in February. So can you just help us understand, do we see a step-down again in 2Q? And then also, Mac, to your prior commentary about that 609-plus amortization by the fourth quarter, is that also still what you expect by year-end? Mac McCullough : Yes, thanks Ken. So absolutely we\u2019re still focused on that 609, excluding intangible amortization and not adjusted for the expense that we need to basically support the revenue initiative. But we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to achieve that 609 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Regarding how it plays out from here, keep in mind that there\u2019s seasonality as we move through the year, but we\u2019re definitely headed towards that 609 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Ken Usdin : So Mac, just a follow-up on that, then. You mentioned it\u2019s ex-amortization and ex-investment, so how do we think about netting all that together? How much is that investment and how much--and or, is any of that investment not already in the run rate? Mac McCullough : So the investment is coming into the run rate, even as we speak, because of the fact that we\u2019re hiring personnel in Chicago, for example, for SBA lending, mortgage banking, those types of activities. I would think about it in terms of your model, whatever you assumed for the incremental revenue, to put an efficiency ratio against that revenue and build it in that way. Ken Usdin : Okay, and just one quick follow-up - short-term borrowing costs were elevated. You mentioned in the release that it was related to liquidity around. Does any of that roll of, and does that help the margin going forward? Mac McCullough : You know, we do have some medium term notes that are rolling off here shortly, and that should be of some assistance to the margin going forward but clearly the March rate increase is going to be helpful as well. Ken Usdin : All right, thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Okay, thanks Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks, good morning guys. Just following up on Ken\u2019s question on the margin, loan yields are up. Maybe Mac, can you touch a little bit on what\u2019s going on there? Is that just the impact of the December rate increase, and could we see a similar type increase in 2Q from the March hike? Mac McCullough : Yes, thanks Jon. So clearly we are seeing the impact of the December increase in the first quarter with the core margin increasing 7 basis points to 3.14. I think probably 2 basis points of that is day basis, so I\u2019d be thinking more about a 5 basis point increase from a core excluding day basis. We definitely expect the core margin to expand from here. Purchase accounting is going to be a bit difficult to forecast, which is why we put the slide in the deck to help you do that. We did have $8 million of accelerated accretion in the quarter above and beyond the normal accretion, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to see the amortization be pulled forward and likely help the margin. But I would continue to look at that accelerated accretion and even some of the normal amortization being allocated to the reserve, because as we see the acquired loans move to the organic book for FirstMerit, we\u2019ve got to provide a reserve for those loans. Does that help? Jon Arfstrom : Yes, that helps. I think what you\u2019re saying is there\u2019s some moving parts, but this is sustainable and we\u2019re likely to see some benefits in Q2. Is that fair? Mac McCullough : Yes, the core margin will expand. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Just a quick follow-up - you touched on the deposit costs, and I noticed they were up modestly, 3 basis points. But anything going on there? Are you seeing any kind of pressure or demands from clients to raise those rates? Mac McCullough : You know, I think - we don\u2019t see a lot of pressure at this point in time. There are some one-off requests that take place. In general, I think liquidity is good in the industry, and I think maybe some of the lack of asset growth in the first quarter across the industry is helping to take some pressure off of deposit pricing. But we\u2019ve actually seen less than 10% deposit beta since the increase in the Fed cycle starting in December of \u201915, so we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s going to be a lot of pressure around pricing in 2017, at least in the near term. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. All right, thank you. Mac McCullough : Okay, thanks Jon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Mac McCullough : Morning John. John Pancari : Good morning. On the credit front, just wanted to get a little bit of color. I saw some movement in the past dues, in the 30-plus past dues on the commercial side of the shop. Not too concerning just yet, but wondering if you could just give us some color on the C&I side, they\u2019re up, and CRE looked like it was up a good amount in the 30-plus past dues as well. Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes, so there is nothing there that is concerning at all. In fact on the CRE side, that movement was one credit that was just an administrative past due, not a payment issue. It just wasn\u2019t renewed prior to quarter end. So we are at a very low level of delinquencies overall, so while there is some movement, it\u2019s still all well controlled in the range, and the CRE is just, again, one item, so very confident in our delinquency levels. John Pancari : Okay. Apologize if I missed any of this - I hopped on late, but in terms of your retail CRE exposure, have you commented on that in terms of sizing and how it looks? Mac McCullough : I haven\u2019t, but I will. So we have a certain level of retail exposure. Obviously we have it both from the C&I space and in the CRE space. In CRE, we have about $1.7 billion of exposure that is in secured exposure and the retail project type, and then we also have about $600 million in our REIT portfolio. The REIT portfolio obviously has a very strong credit profile secured by an unencumbered pool of assets, and no credit issues there. Within the REITs, we have about $250 million of regional mall exposure, so again fairly modest exposure there. A good majority of our exposure is in strip centers, so you would have grocery-anchored strip centers and other anchored strip centers, so those are the local destinations and so not a risk profile that we\u2019re overly concerned about. We do have a list of watch tenants, so we\u2019ve gone through the entire portfolio and reviewed any of those customer that have filed bankruptcy or are intending to file, and then also another tier where they\u2019ve announced store closings, etc. When we go through that entire portfolio and look at the impact of all of those entities, were they to stop paying their rent, we really have --we\u2019ve had a couple of downgrades, a handful of downgrades of no meaningful amount, so we feel very good with where we\u2019re standing in the CRE portfolio. Then on the C&I side, obviously retail is a very broad category, but when you strip out auto dealer and those kinds of exposures, which really aren\u2019t what we think of as conventional retailers, and you get down to food and beverage, building materials, nurseries and then clothing stores, etc., we have about a billion dollars of outstandings, and again no exposure to any of those entities that have been in the headlines filing bankruptcy or maybe intending to. So overall, very confident in our retail exposure. John Pancari : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Lastly, if I could just ask one more on the credit side on auto, I just wanted to see if I could get a little bit more color out of you in terms of what you\u2019re seeing when it comes to the decline in used car values, what that could imply in terms of your exposures, and then also your outlook for growth there. Thanks. Mac McCullough : Sure. I\u2019ll answer that and then I\u2019ll also give a few reminders of what we\u2019ve stated before in terms of our portfolio and why we think it\u2019s different. So first of all, in terms of the used car values, the Manheim Index, while moving around a bit, is still quite strong. It doesn\u2019t impact us quite as much because as a prime/super prime lender, we\u2019re focused mainly on probability of default, not loss given default. We\u2019ve done some stress analysis on our portfolio, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, and a fairly significant drop in the Manheim does not impact us to any great degree, so we aren\u2019t concerned about the values and I think overall they\u2019re holding up fairly well right now. A reminder - we have consistent FICO LTV and term. If you look at the schedules that are included, no movement there. We have no leasing. Again, we\u2019re focused on prime and super prime borrowers. We have no risk layering where we\u2019re combining low FICOs with high LTVs and extended terms. Again, we tend to have a little bit more exposure to the used car markets, which is much more affordable for our customer base, and our performance continues to demonstrate the consistency in our origination policies. So again, very confident in the auto book. John Pancari : Okay, thanks for all the detail. Mac McCullough : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe : Morning. Just a question on the purchase accounting adjustments. Just wanted to make sure I understand Slide 5 properly. Versus what you reported, if I got the numbers right, I think you reported $36 million of PAA in the NII line this quarter, but for the full year you\u2019re saying 68. Does the 68 include any of the accelerated, or is that just sort of the normal scheduled amortization? Just trying to reconcile the numbers. Mac McCullough : Yes Ken, so the 68 does include the first quarter accelerated. Ken Zerbe : Okay, so that would imply roughly $32 million of sort of normal amortization for the next three quarters, ex-any accelerated? Mac McCullough : Yes, that looks right. Ken Zerbe : Got it, okay. Makes sense. And then just one other question on the expenses, just to sort of super clarify, the 609, if we assume that amortization - I don\u2019t know, pick a number, $13 million for the quarter, I just want to make sure that you weren\u2019t--I mean, obviously you exclude any other one-time items, but just from an investment standpoint, is the right number to think about sort of including amortization, sort of that 620, 622 number, or is there--when you report it, is there going to be sort of other investments, other things that are a little more recurring that would take that number higher? Just want to make sure, thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes, the 609, you would need to add the amortization to, right, and I think that\u2019s close to 14. And then we shouldn\u2019t see any non-recurring items related to the FirstMerit acquisition in the fourth quarter. We think we\u2019re going to get through all those expenses in the third quarter. Then the only other thing you need to think about is the expense associated with the revenue investments that we\u2019ve spoken about around the FirstMerit acquisition. Ken Zerbe : Got it. See, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m more asking about. Let\u2019s say you spent $50 million just hypothetically to hire more lenders, to build out something, then your expense number would be meaningfully higher than the 609 plus amortization. I just want to make sure that we\u2019re all thinking about that it\u2019s likely to be higher, if that\u2019s the right way of looking at it, because-- Mac McCullough : Yes, that\u2019s absolutely the right way to think about it, and keep in mind that we add the incremental revenue associated with those initiatives, things like SBA lending and mortgage banking, there are commissions and commission expense that comes along with that revenue. Ken Zerbe : Got it. Have you guys quantified just the magnitude of those additional investments? Mac McCullough : No. I think--again, I think the best way to think about it is to think about the revenue impact and put an efficiency ratio against it, and I would use that as an adjustment for the model. Ken Zerbe : Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Mac McCullough : Thanks Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mac McCullough : Morning Bob. Bob Ramsey : Hey, good morning. Just on that point, what is the right sort of marginal efficiency rate that you would apply to those incremental revenues? Mac McCullough : You know, I would probably--you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that we\u2019re ramping up those investments and that activity. There\u2019s likely to be a higher efficiency ratio in 2017 versus 2018, and efficiency ratio for those businesses in normal times could be in the 55% range, something like that. So again, it\u2019s going to be higher in 2017 relate to 2018 because of the fact that we\u2019re ramping up the investment. Bob Ramsey : Okay. Fair enough. Shifting gears to talk a little bit about loan growth, I know you guys have said 4% to 6% for the year. Obviously we seem to be off to kind of a slow start for the year. That does seem to be an industry-wide trend. But I\u2019m just kind of curious how you\u2019re thinking about the progression of loan growth over the course of the year and what kind of gives you confidence in that 4% to 6% number. Stephen Steinour : Well, we\u2019ve seen--this is Steve, Bob. We\u2019ve had pipeline and activity increases late in the first quarter, so as we came into the second quarter, we were in a reasonably good position. But if we think back to what we\u2019ve seen in, I think, four of the last five years, second half has been stronger than first half for different reasons each year, but there\u2019s sort of fluency to the year now, successive years in terms of activity picking up second quarter and translating into better performance in the second half. We think that will be the case again this year as it has been recently. Certainly pipelines would indicate that, and so our best indicators are in that fashion. We take some confidence in leading economic indicators and other factors, including conversations with customers and potential customers, so reasonably confident we\u2019ve got the ability to deliver on that loan growth range of 4% to 6% for the year. Bob Ramsey : Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Mac McCullough : Morning Steve. Steven Alexopoulos : Morning everybody. Steve, maybe just to follow up on that in terms of first quarter loan growth being seasonally weak and you\u2019re optimistic of a pick-up, just about every other ban out there is saying their commercial customers are in wait-and-see mode here, just watching to see what comes out of Washington. Are you not hearing that from your customers, maybe because your markets are performing a little better? Stephen Steinour : We\u2019re clearly seeing a wait-and-see, I think in the first quarter, and so there\u2019s going to be some continuation of that. But the economic development activity in these different states is very, very strong. There is tremendous foreign direct investment activity in Ohio and Michigan in particular, where I\u2019m closer, and I would say from what they\u2019re telling me, it\u2019s like record levels of inquiry and review.  The midwest still has a manufacturing core, and so the conversations around Made in the USA and import tariffs I think are spurring the level of activity that we should benefit from in our footprint. The states continue to be reasonably well positioned, certainly well run - many of the cities are financially doing well, so I think we\u2019re well positioned to enjoy investment, continued investment, growth and relative outperformance to some of the other regions in the U.S. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe for a follow-up question, on the tax rate, many banks are calling out this quarter new accounting guidance around share-based compensation. What was the impact from this in your first quarter? Mac McCullough : We had $2.9 million associated with that in the first quarter. Steven Alexopoulos : That\u2019s what I need. Thanks guys. Mac McCullough : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed with your question. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : Good morning. So I think there was one thing that you could do on Slide 5, where you\u2019re talking about the purchase accounting accretion, is that for this quarter we just talked about earlier, we had $36 million, you\u2019ve got $32 million for the rest of the year. That seems like a fairly significant step-down, which the other two--you know, the other piece doesn\u2019t move, so that looks like that would have a potentially negative impact when you look at the build of allowance related to the shifting of the loans from purchase accounting to the normal loan portfolio. You\u2019ve built your loan loss allowance by $29 million this quarter, so that would offset most of the incremental benefit you got from the early prepayments. Putting that on that slide would help to net it out in a way that would be, I think, better understanding the bottom line impact. Am I misunderstanding that, or is that how that typically is working? Mac McCullough : No Marty, I think you\u2019re absolutely right. We do see opportunity related to the accelerated accretion to build the reserve because of the fact that those loans moving from acquired to organic need to have the reserve built. Now of course, there\u2019s a process that we go through in determining what the appropriate reserve is, and I wouldn\u2019t want to associate it directly with the accelerated accretion, and I think it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that there\u2019s a Huntington component to this as well associated with loan growth and those types of things.  But I get your point, and I think let us see what we can do to better associate that. Marty Mosby : Just for instance, it looks like the excess, if you just take the 32 and divide it by 3, it gives you about 11. That means you had about $25 million of extra early accretion, and if you look at the allowance build, it was $29 million, so a little bit more negative on allowance build but in line with each other. The other thing is if you look at expenses, looking at the expense base in this particular quarter, there\u2019s really two pieces that I felt like we didn\u2019t show--you know, were unfavorable surprises. One, outside data occupancy and equipment, which are typically kind of related to some of the consolidations you did in the first quarter, so that could just be timing, that was up--those three categories were actually up a little bit from the fourth quarter, which could have been working on the consolidation and eventually rolling down. And then deposit insurance stepped up about $5 million this quarter as well, so just was curious if you could address those two issues going forward. Mac McCullough : Yes, I would say that the first item, this is just primarily timing in terms of the activity that we see and the work that we\u2019re doing. We did have a small true-up in the FDIC of about $1.5 million, so that is a bit of an unusual item in the quarter. Marty Mosby : Perfect, thanks. Mac McCullough : Okay, thanks Marty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Barker : Good morning. I noticed that--you know, to follow on some of John\u2019s questions regarding the credit outlook, I noticed that 90-day delinquency and NPAs, trends look okay on a consolidated basis, but the criticized ratio continues to move higher over the last three quarters. Can you just give us a little bit of color around the trends around the criticized ratio and what you\u2019re seeing there? Mac McCullough : Yes, I would say it\u2019s mixed. From quarter to quarter, you\u2019re going to see movement of varying degrees, and we\u2019re starting to get year-end statements in now, so that\u2019s a piece of it. But I think generally speaking, the outlook is very good. I mean, if you look at how it translates into NPAs, NPAs are actually down a fair amount, charge-offs are well controlled, so we are very much focused on early recognition so that the minute we see any negative developments, we are very quick to downgrade. But I think the obvious point and what we are pleased with is that it does not roll through. NPAs are very well controlled. Two-thirds of our commercial NPAs are current on principal and interest. I think that points to our conservative stance; and again, charge-offs are very well controlled. So I think the criticized inflow is about the only credit metric out there that wasn\u2019t improved this quarter, and again I think it has more to do with early recognition of any potential problems, which gives us more options in terms of rehabilitating credit, etc. So no concerns on my end there. I think it speaks more to our risk identification. Kevin Barker : Okay. Then in relation to some of your guidance around targeting an efficiency ratio and then looking at our revenue, can you talk about the timing on how you see the efficiency ratio peaking in \u201917 before it declines back in \u201918? Is there any particular quarter you\u2019re looking at where you think the peak will be? [Indiscernible]. Stephen Steinour : I\u2019m sorry, Kevin, could you repeat the last part? Kevin Barker : Where do you see that efficiency ratio peaking in \u201917 before it starts to decline in \u201918 in regards to your investments in the business? Stephen Steinour : Yes, I think we likely see a peak here in the first quarter. There are some seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter and there is also seasonally lower revenue, especially on the fee side in the first quarter, so I would view the first quarter as being a bit of a peak. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Stephen Steinour : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star, two if you\u2019d like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Geoff. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. A quick one on CCAR. In the changes around the qualitative part of the test, what does that mean in practice for Huntington? How are you going to be assessed on the qualitative side going forward? When is that going to happen, and what do you think it means in terms of potential capital returns? Stephen Steinour : Thanks for the question, Geoff. So I think we\u2019re going to see how this CCAR cycle plays out. Obviously this is the first time we\u2019ve gone through with the difference in the qualitative, and I think we just have to understand that that has a material difference or not as we move through it. Clearly we would feel that we would have more opportunity to think about the dividend opportunity and also total payout opportunity, and I think we did position ourselves well related to the CCAR cycle with what we did with the balance sheet optimization in late 2016, picking up about 43 basis points of CET1.  So really, Geoff, I think we have to see how the process plays out. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just switching back to the earlier questions on the retail exposure, I just wanted to check I got the numbers right. You said $1.7 billion of secured retail plus $600 million of REITs within CRE? Mac McCullough : Correct. Geoffrey Elliott : And that\u2019s out of the total $7.1 billion? Mac McCullough : Correct. Geoffrey Elliott : So that, just on math, is kind of a 32% concentration, so I\u2019m kind of curious what are the concentration limits that you apply there? Mac McCullough : We don\u2019t actually disclose the individual concentration limits we have. We have an overall CRE and then we have a CRE by project type, and we are within all of those limits as it stands today. Geoffrey Elliott : Okay, thank you. Stephen Steinour : Thanks Geoff. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Steinour for closing remarks. Stephen Steinour : Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re off to a solid start this year. We had good financial performance in the first quarter and equally important, we continued to make very significant progress in the integration of FirstMerit. Our colleagues have really rallied together as one team, bringing the best of Huntington to our customers. We\u2019re encouraged by the sentiment we\u2019re seeing and hearing from our customers and hopeful that thoughtful action in Washington will help bring about more than just optimism. Our strategies are working, our execution of goals continues to drive good results, we expect to continue to gain market share and grow share of wallet. Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priority remains realizing the full set of opportunities with FirstMerit and growing our core business. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to manage risks and volatility and drive solid, consistent long-term performance.  So thank you for your interest in Huntington, we appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Davidson Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffrey  Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks Operator : Greetings and welcome to Huntington Bancshares Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. Mark Muth : Thank you. Welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the IR website, of Huntington\u2019s website huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 3 and an overview of the second quarter results. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial performance, including record net income and we continue to make solid progress with the FirstMerit integration completing the remaining FirstMerit Systems conversions during the quarter. Steve will provide a more detailed update on the integration later in the call. During the quarter, we also received the results for the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test and the annual CCAR process. We believe our DFAST credit losses distinguish Huntington among our peers again this year. Our cumulative stress losses and a severely adverse scenario were the fourth lowest, our third consecutive year to be among the four lowest regional banks. We also received no objection from the Federal Reserve to our proposed capital plans submitted and the CCAR process. The capital plan includes an increase in the cash dividend from $0.08 per share to $0.11 per share beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017 dividend, subject to board approval at that time, and a repurchase of up to 308 million of common stock over the fourth quarter period through June of 2018. The reinstatement of the buyback is an important milestone for Huntington as we have completely replenished our CET1 capital ratio following the strategic capital deployments in the FirstMerit transaction. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 3 and review second quarter results. Please keep in mind that all year-over-year comparisons will benefit from the inclusion of FirstMerit as the acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2016. Huntington recorded earnings per common share of $0.23 for the second quarter of 2017, up 21% over the year ago quarter. This is inclusive of $0.03 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics that I will highlight on this slide. Also including the significant impact of significant items, return on assets was 1.09%, return on common equity was 10.6%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.4%. Tangible book value per share decreased 8% from the year ago quarter to $6.74. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially from the first quarter. Total revenue increased $295 million or 37% year-over-year, which included 47% growth in net interest income and 20% growth in non-interest income. Non-interest expense increased $171 million or up 33% year-over-year. Non-interest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased 141 million or 28% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and ongoing investments in technology, including digital, mobile, and cyber and ongoing investments in our colleagues. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 62.9%.However net acquisition related expenses added 4.6 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. Adjusting for the significant items, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.3%. The reconciliation for this number can be found on Slide 16. Moving onto the balance sheet, average total loans grew 30% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth fully funded loan growth increasing by 39% year-over-year. Credit quality remained strong with improvement in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined risk management. Net charge-offs were 21 basis points of average loans remaining well below our long-term financial goal of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. This was up from 13 basis points in the year ago quarter, but down slightly from 24 basis points in the first quarter of 2017 consistent with normal seasonality. The NPA ratio decreased by 32 basis points from a year ago benefiting in part from the impact of purchase accounting and the acquired portfolio. We managed the bank with an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and our results continue to illustrate disciplined focus on risk management. Finally, our capital ratios continue to increase. As of quarter-end, our CET1 ratio was 9.88%, well within our 9% to 10% operating guideline. While our TCE ratio was 7.41%. As I mentioned previously, our CET1 ratio is now above our pre-FirstMerit level from year ago, while other capital ratios continue to replenish. Turning to Slide 4, total revenue was up 37% from the year ago quarter, primarily driven by net interest income, which was up 47% reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and disciplined organic growth. The net interest margin was 3.31% for the second quarter, up 25 basis points from a year ago and up 1 basis point on a linked quarter basis. Purchased accounting had a favorable impact of 15 basis points on a net interest margin in the second quarter, compared to 16 basis points in the first quarter. Non-interest income increased 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good growth in service charges on deposit accounts in card and payment processing revenue. Both of which reflect the FirstMerit acquisition, as well as organic customer acquisition and continue to increase customer debit and credit card activity. Non-interest expense increased 33% year-over-year. Significant items again impacted both 2017 and 2016 second quarter expenses. For the second quarter of 2017, acquisition related expense totaled $50 million. Adjusted non-interest expense in the first quarter grew 28% from the year ago quarter primarily from the inclusion of FirstMerit. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, adjusted non-interest expense increased 10 million or 2%, driven primarily by the seasonal increase in marketing and the seasonal increase in personnel expense, related to the implementation of annual merit increases and long-term incentive grants in the second quarter. These increases were partially offset by the benefits from the FirstMerit cost takeouts. For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations on Page 15 of the presentation slides or in the release. Let me also reiterate, we remain on track to achieve the $255 million of annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the FirstMerit acquisition. With the successful FirstMerit conversion and branch consolidations, particularly with respect to consumer deposit retention positioned us to re-examine our physical distribution sooner than we would have otherwise expected. As a result of this review, we recently announced the planned consolidation of 38 branches, plus seven drive-through only locations. All of which are expected to close late in the third quarter. These locations included both the legacy Huntington and legacy FirstMerit branches.  This could be viewed as a modest upsizing of our cost savings expectations by a couple million dollars per quarter. However, the additional servings are not expected to fall to the bottom line as we have recently accelerated some of our ongoing technology investments, especially digital. Slide 5 illustrates that we are well on our way to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2017. You're accustomed to hearing us talk about this every quarter stressing how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. In 2016, we enjoyed our fourth consecutive year of positive operating leverage and we remain confident that 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year. Moving to Slide 6, average earning assets grew 35% from the year ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 56% increase in average securities and a 31% increase in average C&I loans. The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit's portfolio, the reinvestment of cash flows, including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the fourth quarter of 2016, and additional investments in liquidity coverage ratio Level 1 qualifying securities. During the second quarter, average total loans increased about 0.5%, compared to the prior quarter. On a period end basis, total loans increased 1.4% or 5.7% annualized. In light of normal seasonality, coupled with our expectations for a modest increase in economic activity in our footprint over the remainder of the year, we are reiterating our expectations for a period end loan growth of 4% to 6% for the full year of 2017. The year-over-year increase in average C&I loans, primarily reflected the FirstMerit acquisition, as well as increases in core little market, especially lending verticals, business banking, and auto core plan. During the second quarter, we continue to face headwinds and corporate banking as a number of these large borrowers paid down their bank debt by accessing the debt markets in order of the lock in current low rates. This quarter also saw an elevated amount of run-off from FirstMerit loans targeted to exit the bank as they did not fit our strategy on risk appetite. These were all loans identified during the due diligence and included both auto floorplan and middle market commercial credits. C&I balances were further impacted by payoffs and paydowns of certain non-performing loans helping to drive a 9% sequential decline in non-performing assets. We also experienced paydowns and run-offs within the commercial real estate portfolio, which declined 4% sequentially. Average auto loans increased 12% year-over-year with the second quarter representing another strong quarter of consistent disciplined loan production. Originations totaled 1.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.58% in the second quarter up from 3.54% in the prior quarter and up almost 50 basis points from the year ago quarter. Average residential mortgage loans increased 29% year-over-year, as we continue to see strong demand for mortgages across our footprint. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Turning our attention to the chart on the right side of Slide 7, average total deposits increased 38% from the year ago quarter, including a 39% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 56% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase in low-cost DDA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit's low-cost deposit base, as well as our continuing focus on checking account relationship acquisition. We continue to experience only modest core deposit attrition so far from the FirstMerit acquisition limited primarily to certain governments and corporate deposits. Further, we have had tremendous success on the consumer side as consumer deposits from FirstMerit customers and former FirstMerit branches were up 2% between August 2016 and June 2017. Importantly, we remain ahead of our original pro forma model with respect to retention of deposit balances. Moving to Slide 7, our net interest margin was 331 for the second quarter, up 25 basis points from the year ago quarter. The increase reflected a 34 basis point increase in earning asset yields and a 2 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest-bearing deposits balance against 11 basis point increase in funding cost. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 1 basis point, driven by 5 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and a 3 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest-bearing deposits. Firstly, offset by a 7 basis point increase in funding cost. The increase in funding cost was more heavily weighted to wholesale funding as we remain pleased with our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing so far as our cost of total deposits only increased 3 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 15 basis points to the net interest margin in the second quarter, down from 16 basis points in the prior quarter. After adjusting for this impact the core NIM was 3.16%, compared to 3.14% in the first quarter, also adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting and 3.06% in the second quarter of 2016. The linked quarter comparison improves by approximately 1 basis point, if you adjust for day count. As I just mentioned and calling your attention to the orange line at the bottom of the graph on the left, our cost of total deposits was only 22 basis points for the second quarter. This represents a 6 basis point increase over the year ago quarter and a 3 basis point increase sequentially. Clearly illustrating the strong core deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing. We have seen consumer and small-business deposit pricing remain relatively steady in the face of recent Fed interest rate hikes. While the majority of pricing pressure has been limited to Government Banking, Corporate Banking, and the upper end of middle market commercial. On our earning asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 57 basis points year-over-year and consumer loan yields increased 48 basis points. On a linked quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 11 basis points, while consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points. Security yields were relatively flat with both the prior and year ago quarters. Approximately $625 million of asset swaps matured in the second quarter and we intend to continue to allow the remaining swaps to run off by the first quarter of 2018 as scheduled.  Slide 8 shows the expected pretax net impact of first accounting adjustments on an annual forward looking basis. We introduced this slide last fall and believe it is useful in helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion and accept for what we experienced in the first half of 2017, do not include on the accelerated accretion from the accelerated recapture through early payoffs or extensions in the projected periods. As we have stated previously, and our results in the past four quarters illustrate, in reality we're likely to experience loan extensions and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion. Therefore you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars continue to be pulled forward as modifications and early payoffs occur. Let me also remind you that some of the accelerated accretion may be offset by provision expense as acquired FirstMerit loans renew and we establish a loan loss reserve in normal course. As a result, we intend to continue to provide regular updates of this schedule going forward and so the majority of that of purchase accounting accretion has been recognized. Turning to Slide 9, from the very beginning we made it clear that value creation for the FirstMerit acquisition was built upon the significant cost savings inherent in the deal and that our financial positions did not depend on revenue synergies. That said, we believe there is significant revenue enhancement opportunities, some near-term and some longer-term, which will be additive to the baseline economics of the deal. Slide 9 is an update of a slide you have seen numerous times over the past three quarters, discussing our expectations for achieving the full 255 million of annualized cost savings and illustrating our 609 million adjusted noninterest expense target for the fourth quarter of 2017. As we have stated previously, the 609 million adjusted expense target excludes expense from intangible amortization, the FDIC\u2019s temporary surcharge, and the incremental expense from FirstMerit related revenue enhancement initiatives. The chart on the upper right details these items and provides our initial estimate of the incremental expense from the revenue initiatives, which is about $12 million. As you can see in the chart, on the bottom of the page, we currently estimate a total of $41 million of the total incremental expense from revenue initiatives this year and $50 million in 2018. As I mentioned during last quarter's conference call, we expect the revenue initiatives to have an incremental efficiency ratio of approximately 50% in 2018, and higher this year as the ramp in revenues will naturally lag some of the up cost expense. Slide 10 provides additional detail on the FirstMerit related revenue enhancement opportunities. The bar chart on the top of the slide displays our current targets for additional revenue from the initiatives, which are detailed below. In 2017, the revenue ramp corresponds with incremental hiring and the corresponding increase in production. For 2018, we are targeting the 100 million of total revenue enhancements that we have discussed since we announced the deal. The bottom half of the slide details some of the specific revenue enhancement opportunities we have discussed on prior presentations. First, there is a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with legacy FirstMerit customers utilizing our optimal customer relationship or OCR strategy, our more robust products and capabilities and our deep commitment to excellent customer service. We are encouraged by the early progress and we'll build on this long-term opportunity through focused execution. Next, our interest into Chicago and Wisconsin represent attractive opportunities in two areas where we\u2019ve made significant investments and developed strong capabilities. SBA lending and mortgage banking. Our past results illustrate that SBA lending is at a distinctive area of expertise in strength for Huntington. We\u2019re excited to expand our SBA expertise into these new markets, especially Chicago where there are more small businesses in the entire states of Ohio or Michigan. We\u2019re fully staffed on SBA lenders and these two new markets and we are highly confident in our success based on our initial results. In fact, as of June, Huntington has increased from basically zero presence a year ago to the number four most active SBA 7 A lender in both Illinois and Wisconsin. We also feel there is an opportunity to expand our mortgage banking business in these markets and our overlap markets. We have made significant investments in our mortgage banking platform in the past few years and the expansion provides further opportunity to leverage our enhanced capabilities. Again, we have already added new mortgage lenders in these new markets and are especially pleased with the talent and production we are seeing out of the Chicago market. Finally, we believe there is an opportunity to expand FirstMerit's attractive recreational vehicle and marine finance business. Nick Stanutz, who is the head of our highly successful auto finance business, runs RV and marine finance with the same discipline, risk management protocols, and in some cases technology that he applies to our super prime auto finance business. We have expanded this business from its prior 17 state footprint to 34 states and the early results are already exceeding our business plan. Slide 11 illustrates the continued progress we\u2019ve made in rebuilding our regulatory capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. Common Equity Tier 1 or CET1 ended the quarter at 9.88%, up 8 basis points year-over-year. We have mentioned previously that our operating guideline for CET1 is the 9% to 10% range. Tangible Common Equity ended the quarter at 7.41%, down 55 basis points year-over-year, but up 13 basis points linked quarter. Moving to Slide 12, we book provision expense of $25 million in the second quarter, compared to net charge-offs of $36 million. The lower provision expense this quarter reflected the overall improvement in credit quality and reduced purchase accounting market amortization. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 21 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 basis to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down three basis points from the prior quarter, and up 8 basis points from the year ago quarter. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-off by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides. In particular, I would point out to you the improvement in auto net charge-offs this quarter. The ACL as a percentage of loans decreased 3 basis points linked quarter to 1.11%, but the NAL coverage ratio increased to 207% as a result of the 9% linked quarter decline in nonaccrual loans. Overall asset quality metrics remained strong. Non-performing assets decreased $43 million or 9% linked quarter. The NPA ratio is 7 basis points sequentially to 61 basis points. The criticized asset ratio decreased 6 basis points from 3.72% to 3.66%. Our 90-day plus delinquencies remained essentially flat. We also continue to experience lower NPA inflows in the third quarter in a row. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mac, and good morning to all of you. We are on the home stretch of our prepared remarks. So moving to the economies, Slide 14, we illustrate selective key economic indicators for our footprint. We previously noted our regional footprint has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery over the last several years and I remain bullish on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our footprint and as you can see unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint continue to trend favorably. The charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. As shown on the top chart five of the eight states in our footprint produced stronger economic growth in the nation as a whole and during three months through May, which is the most recent date available. Further as depicted in the bottom chart, the leading indexes for our footprint as of May showed that 78 states expect positive economic growth over the next six months. Slide 15 illustrates trends and unemployment rates for our 10 largest deposit markets in many of the large MSAs, the footprint remains at or near 15 year lows for unemployment as of the end of May. The labor markets in our footprint have proven to be strong with several markets such as here in Columbus and in Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see labor shortages. Now we've previously noted that we are seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. Housing markets across the footprint continue to display broad-based home price inflation, while remaining in some of the most affordable markets in the US. There are also exciting pockets of innovation centers developing in our footprint, including here in Columbus, in Pittsburgh, and in Ann Harbor Michigan, for example. In fact there is a recent article in the New York Times discussing some of the innovation centers are related to the auto industry. I can tell you that the transportation research Centre at Ohio State is world-class and is incredibly significant to the future of mobile, of AV for auto. So the research and development related to these centers adds an exciting element to the economic outlook for our footprint. And finally we continue to see optimism across our consumer and business customer base. Our loan pipelines have remained steady. We continue to expect that economic activity and thus loan production will modestly improve in the second half of the year. So let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 for some closing remarks and important messages. We\u2019ve delivered good results in the second quarter, a record quarter of net income. Our financial performance in the first half of the year was solid, and we successfully completed the FirstMerit system systems conversions. We\u2019re very focused on driving revenue and achieving the financial benefits inherent in the FirstMerit acquisition. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns and the strategy entails reducing short-term volatility and achieving top tier performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. We were pleased with the DFAST and CCAR results released in June, which provided important industry comparisons and illustrates our strong enterprise risk management and our discipline to operate within our credit risk appetite. The non-objection from the Fed to CCAR capital plan sets us up to significantly increase our cash dividend for the fourth quarter or for the fourth consecutive year and reinstate our buyback program. The FirstMerit acquisition accelerated our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals and with the integration largely complete, we expect to deliver against the goals this year, as well as next year. We remain on pace to deliver our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition with a only limited number left to be implemented in the third quarter. All remaining cost savings will be completed by the third quarter as originally communicated. We also continue to execute on the significant revenue enhancement opportunities, including the SBA, and home lending expenses in Chicago and Wisconsin, and the RV and marine lending expansion. This is combined with the OCR opportunity from bringing our superior products and services to our expanded customer base. All of which have been discussed on previous earnings calls and investor conferences. It is very exciting to build on these initiatives and to see them perform at these levels. We continue to execute on delivering a differentiated customer experience built upon our welcome culture and our relationship focus to drive sustained core deposit and loan growth.  We\u2019ve invested and as we\u2019ve often indicated we will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly within our customer facing teams and in mobile and digital technologies, as well as data and analytics. Importantly, we plan to continue to appropriately manage our expenses within our revenue outlook. We have shown agility in the past to adjust expenses when conditions or outlook changes and we will do so in the future. Finally, I would like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the fifth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. Our outlook for the full year of 2017 is unchanged from what we shared with you at year end and last quarter. We continue to expect total revenue growth in excess of 20% consistent with our long-term financial goal we are targeting annual positive operating leverage. We expect average balance sheet growth also in excess of 20%, and we expect to fully implement all of the $255 million in annualized cost savings from the FirstMerit acquisition by the third quarter. Finally, we expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 basis point to 55 basis points. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Thanks Steve. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may state your question. Ken Usdin : Hi thanks, good morning. Mac McCullough : Good morning Ken. Steve Steinour : Good morning Ken. Ken Usdin : Mac, just wondering just on the loan growth outlook, I know you talked about the pay downs in commercial and theory, and you know just wondering are you expecting loans to get better as you go through the second half to get to the to 4% to 6% range and are you still contemplating at auto securitization within that 4% to 6% outlook? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes, thanks Ken. Yes, so we do expect the second half of the year to improve from organic growth perspective, and we did have the headwinds that we talked about with the FirstMerit exits, were all - all were anticipated. We actually identified during the due diligence process and I would tell you that there is probably 200 million there that came out in the quarter. We do anticipate an auto securitization yet this year, which is included in the 4% to 6% guidance that we\u2019ve given and we would tell you that the pipelines are where we\u2019ve seen them in terms of the strength and what\u2019s coming through. So, again we do expect to see some improvement as the year progresses. Steve Steinour : We also had Ken about 2% drop in commercial utilization. So, a fair amount of headwinds in the second quarter with the combination of those factors and we came through that and so the pipeline as we sit here today reflects essentially what we had at the end of the first quarter and we think a lot of the headwinds have been adjusted. Ken Usdin : Okay. And just a follow-up on another start of the balance sheet, so Mac, your point about the reserve build related to the FirstMerit new loans, this quarter you had not only really low charge-offs, but a reserve release. So can you just try to walk us through what are these components moving on and do we kind of go back to the reserve builds or this one seem to be a zag within that broader commentary of continuing to expect the reserve to build over time? Thanks Dan Neumeyer : Hi Ken, this is Dan. So this was an unusual quarter for us. So, obviously we did have the credit quality improvements, particularly in C&I, the big reduction in nonaccrual loans of about 9%. The interesting thing was this quarter a number of those loans had large specific reserves tied to them. So, a largest single specific reserve we got paid out of that credit and then we had a couple - two of a next three largest credits where energy deals where we had pay downs of the loans and improvement in the collateral and cash flows negating the needs for a specific results on those. So that combination was an unusual dynamics. So on a go forward basis, we would expect that natural accrual. We would expect, as we\u2019ve said a slow and gradual move back towards the coverage ratios you would have seen prior to the FirstMerit deal. Think about charge-offs, plus some room for a growing portfolio is how we think about it. Steve Steinour : Ken, I would point out that we had good performance in auto so across the board the metrics was really was quite strong. It is unusual were literally everything comes positive in the given quarter, and in this - so we have one of those. This is exceptional and not the norm. Ken Usdin : Understood, good to see the underlying there as well. So, thanks Steve. Steve Steinour : Absolutely. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks Ken. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Moss with FBR Capital Market. You may proceed. Kyle Peterson : Hi guys, this is actually Kyle Peterson on for Steve today. I was wondering if you could start on margin, specifically kind of the core when you kind of strip out the accretion. Got a couple of bps of expansion in this quarter, I was wondering what you guys were kind of thinking between loan and deposit side benefit from June rate hike? Mac McCullough : Yes, Kyle, we are going to continue to see expansion in the core margin. We haven't seen all of the benefit in the loans side from the June increase and we continue to manage the cost of deposits really well as you can see with the 3 basis points increase on a linked quarter basis. So, clearly we think that there is expansion in the core margin from here, and adjusting for day basis in the second quarter we\u2019re probably up 3 basis points from the first quarter. Kyle Peterson : Okay great. And then I guess if you could just expand a little bit on that, kind of on the swaps I know you guys have been pouring back some of that exposure, just kind of potential impacts that could have on NIM with any future rate hikes kind of once those are all rolled off? Steve Steinour : Yes, so the asset swaps continue to roll off as scheduled and we don't have any plans to replace those. We\u2019re currently about 6.4% asset sensitive and actually without the asset swaps it only has the 10th of a percent to asset sensitivity. So really the asset swaps are pretty much a non-event at this point. Kyle Peterson : Okay great. Thanks guys. Steve Steinour : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. You may proceed. Scott Siefers : Good morning guys. Mac McCullough : Hi, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hi Mac, quick question. First of all, thank you guys for adding those slides 9 and 10 with the 4Q expense expectation as well as, sort of the walk forward on revenue side, I don\u2019t mean to pin you down too much on the near term expectation Mac, but could you kind of walk us through the expense trajectory for the remainder of the year? Because I guess, what is implied is, you come down a little from this quarters, call it $645 million to the $639 million in the reminder of the year and just there were a few puts and takes, right, I guess you have seasonally upgraded in a couple of areas in the 2Q, but then you also presumably have the branch consolidation benefits, I think, though you said there is some offset on the digital and investment side. So, how should we expect expenses to progress through the remainder of this year? Mac McCullough : Yes, Scott, so a few things, I mean, we are highly confident in the 609 for the fourth quarter excluding the intangible amortization and the FirstMerit revenue initiatives. The second quarter that we're looking at is seasonally higher, we have merit increases in this quarter, we have the impact of some stock compensation expense that hits this quarter that one-time in nature as it relates to the year, and we also had some seasonally higher marketing this quarter. So, those three things alone are probably $10 million to $15 million, closer to $15 million. So, very confident as we move from this level down to the 609 in the fourth quarter as I described. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. I think that actually does it for me. That\u2019s a helpful walk there, I appreciate that. Mac McCullough : Thanks Scott. Operator : Okay. Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks, good morning guys. Mac McCullough : Hi Jon. Jon Arfstrom : I did have a bigger question, but I just wanted to ask on the swaps, Mac. During the details, it looks like the swaps maybe cost you a little bit of money on commercial loan yield this quarter. Am I looking at that correctly? Mac McCullough : That would be correct. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. And is it a bit of a headwind again in Q3 and Q4? And then as we see these swaps roll off, it's maybe helpful in 2018 to commercial loan yields? Mac McCullough : Yes absolutely. It will be a headwind through the first quarter of 2018, really pretty small in the scheme of things and then once they are got we get the full benefit of the rate increase coming through and the adjustable rate C&I levels. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, okay. Good, that helps. On the incremental reduction in branches, Steve, do you view this as a onetime item? Or is this something that's ongoing? And could we see more of this as things progress? Steve Steinour : Jon, we\u2019ve been suggesting that we would review the branches like any good retailer, periodically. We tend to do it about every year and the track record would show a fairly consistent period of activity between every year, year and a half for the last 5, 6 years. So, we will continue to operate with that, and again like any good retailer we will be looking at our distribution. We are seeing continued - in particular mobile take-up by our customers both consumers and businesses, it is one of the reasons we\u2019re investing more, if you will, accelerating some of our plans, and so you could expect to see more distribution consolidation from us over time. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Steve Steinour : We remain Jon with number one branch here in Ohio and Michigan. So, you think about that over an extended period of time and as this transition to more and more mobile occurs, I think it gives us a really significant, set of opportunities over time. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Does this change your thinking at all on distribution in Chicago, in terms of maybe looking at a more digital expansion of your retail business in Chicago? Steve Steinour : It doesn't change our strategy because it has all been consistent. We are looking for niche opportunities, principally business focused. We are not going to run the same play in Chicago that we\u2019re doing in Ohio and Michigan in terms of dense distribution. We will, so we do think of Ohio, Chicago as an opportunity to pilot some of what we want to get done with mobile. And we will continue to use it on that basis. The combination of mobile and digital and data and analytics in a market as dense as Ohio is very attractive to us with the current distribution. We\u2019re subscale, I don't think we are highly unlikely to build it out. So, we will be coming at it differently. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. All right. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks Jon. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. You may proceed. Kevin Reevey : Good morning guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning Kevin. Kevin Reevey : So it looks like second quarter you had some very strong performance in your capital markets business, what\u2019s the pipeline going forward into the third quarter, do you expect this line of business to continue to remain strong as this is kind of more seasonal than anything else? Mac McCullough : Kevin we had a really good quarter in the second quarter and a lot of that activity can be tied to either market circumstances volatility or commercial activity, and as we have said we think the commercial activity in the second half of the year is better than the first half or will be and we are also pretty good start in the quarter. Kevin Reevey : And then my last question is related to deposit price, it sounds like you were able to continue the lag your deposit pricing in the quarter, which had helped you a little bit on the margin, how many rate hikes do you think that will take before you will have to kind of start moving your deposit pricing up? Mac McCullough : Kevin it is going to be really based on what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. We are seeing a little bit more competition in our markets, but feel very confident in our core deposit base because of the strategy that we\u2019ve put in place in 2010, around building relationships with the quality of the fair play product sets and mindset, and how do we actually serves the customer. We think it feels us with an advantage in times like this when we see increases in deposit pricing and we can maybe lag a little bit more than the competition even. We are really pleased with what we have been able to do so far. The deposit betas are very attractive for us at this point in time, but I would think by that time we get at least the second increase from here, we will see a bit more pressure in what\u2019s happening. Kevin Reevey : Great, thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. You may proceed. Geoffrey Elliott : Hi good morning, thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could speak a little bit more about auto, you had some growth this quarter, what it\u2019s your appetite for growing auto like at the moment and how is the competitive environment shaping up? Steve Steinour : Geoff we remain highly confident in the quality of what we\u2019re underwriting. We\u2019re very, very disciplined and you see the statistics every quarter. The credit quality performance, there\u2019s been an anxiety around auto for last three years. The credit quality performance and the consistency of it, I think it\u2019s clearly coming through, as it did in this quarter in particular. And so we will we have limits in place in terms of what we believe on balance sheet, we use securitization as an outlet.  We will continue to do that. As you heard Mac talk about it, it is not a business where we expect to adjust the limits that we have now. We will operate within those guidelines. We ramped it up a bit post Q3 and just believe then that with our discipline on credit that we were getting our better risk return trade-off than what was available in securities. So we continue to believe that as we look at the business today and prepare it to alternative risk returns. Geoffrey Elliott : And on the competitive side, how things are shaping up there, we have seen some of the other banks pulling back a bit, is that creating opportunities? Steve Steinour : There is a - this industry cycle is on the finance side, and we think we\u2019re entering one of the more attractive periods. Like 2010, 2011, 2012 were attractive. So there is a bit less competition, as others pull back. Those that bought deep are clearly feeling the challenges from the credit risk they took and so a combination of factors, I think we are making it even more interesting to us prospectively. We are also applying some of our data and analytics to this portfolio. We\u2019ve been managing with some unique tools over the last year and a half. We think we are making better trade-off decisions, and pricing clearly has gone up as we referenced it is up about 50 basis points of Q2 last year to this year. Geoffrey Elliott : Great, thank you very much. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey. You may proceed. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi Kevin. Kevin Barker : In regards to the comment about the swaps earlier, would you expect some of that incremental interest income or at least the interest headwind to start to be released over third and fourth quarter before the swaps actually expire in the first quarter or is it something just where it just happens as a full maturity in the first quarter? Mac McCullough : Well it is basically will run off pro rata along with the run off of the swaps themselves. Steve Steinour : It is very laddered. Mac McCullough : It is. So it\u2019s very gradual from this point to the first quarter of 2018. It is actually a very small amount in the first quarter of 2018. Kevin Barker : So at the short end of your current stay is, or that stay is stable, from where it is today and so the first quarter, how much of a tail wind would you expect on interest income? Steve Steinour : Related to the swaps? Kevin Barker : Yes. Mac McCullough : It is a very small number. I think it\u2019s probably 1 million or 2 million. I mean it is not large at all. Steve Steinour : The specific details will be in the footnotes in the Q, here in a few weeks. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in regards to the revenue synergies that you are generating off of the $50 million investment, what specifically have you seen so far in the second quarter start to benefit and start to come through on the income statement? Steve Steinour : Well we obviously have our mortgage production and pipelines and we are seeing that flow-through very significantly. FirstMerit was not an SBA lender, so for us to be number three in Chicago, four in Chicago depending on what you want to measure, and same with Wisconsin, that\u2019s all a result of the initiatives. We\u2019re starting to break out some of the RV marine portfolio, as well for as you can see the growth in that portfolio, and it\u2019s a portfolio that has performed very well through the cycle for FirstMerit. And we have some experience in terms of the team we put in place, about two years ago now to help us understand and manage that. So we are able to leverage the skill sets and technology is somewhat in auto and apply it to that book as well. So we see in terms of broadly the OCR activity whether it\u2019s cross sell of products. At the branch level or through phone or other distribution channels we\u2019re able to track that and we see that coming on as well. So, we like what we see occurring now. And there's been a lot of effort to make sure the conversion and integration activities went really well through the first half of this year. So, second half is entirely a focus on driving that revenue further. Dan Neumeyer : And Kevin on Slide 10 you can see the progression by quarter of the revenue related to the initiatives for 2017, and you can see it for 2018 as well with the expected expenses with those initiatives on Slide 9. Kevin Barker : Thank you for taking my question. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Mark Muth : Operator, next question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. You may proceed. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Steve Steinour : Hi Marty. Marty Mosby : Steve I wanted to back up a second because we\u2019ve been talking about a lot of minutia and details and we really haven't talked about the key results from what you\u2019ve been able to do with FirstMerit acquisition, and that is the improvement in return on tangible common equity, it is one thing that we don't have a trend in this massive presentation you give out, but yet looking at how that\u2019s stepping up. And then, you know Mac you just talk about the impact of the seasonality in expenses, which actually held back this particular quarter, so a step-up from what was a 12% return before the acquisition, now is getting to, when you look into the next quarter and take that seasonality out, something north of 15%, and even could be close to 16% next quarter. So, you are seeing that kind of benefit come through and as you are then going to generate synergies going forward, kind of where do you think we kind of push forward on that particular matter because I think that\u2019s the end result of the combination you\u2019ve made here? Steve Steinour : Well Marty when we announced the deal, we talked about it as accelerating and enhancing our long-term financial goals and one of those is a TCE, return on TCE of 13% to 15% and at the announcement we suggested we saw our way to the upper end of that. And we in fact expect to deliver that and potentially go beyond it depending on was it occurring in the economy and sort of the interest rate environment, but we are very, very focused on those metrics and that\u2019s an important one. May, one of the most important ones for us, and as we have talked before, our board will be reviewing performance against the metrics and coming into next year determining whether they should be adjusted or not. We do feel this was a very powerful transformational opportunity for us and we think we are executing it very well. So, that combination should put us in a position over just another couple of quarters where we can show without one-time expense or transaction-related expenses, pretty strong performance. Anything to add Mac. Mac McCullough : I think it sums it up really well. I mean that\u2019s one of the reasons why we did the deals, it is obviously a great strategic fit, risk appetite was the right, customers we know, great colleagues and improving the return profile. So, we feel like we're right on track in terms of what we expect. Marty Mosby : And then Mac, just on a follow-up in that kind of vein is, when you look at the purchase accounting accretion, the way that kind of works out, you have been offsetting most of that benefit from building allowance. This particular quarter you had some events that didn't turn out that particular way, but when you are looking at purchase down accounting accretion versus the eventual synergies that you pick up, it\u2019s almost like that will schedule that you put down there and show that versus the intangible kind of write-off, you ought to put the synergies on there too, to show the three elements. In other words, the other piece of the puzzle is the synergies you are going to build instead of a positive number that\u2019s going to go negative. Over time you actually have the reverse. You have the synergies kind of come in and over swamp this particular diagram. So, again it is a little misleading in a sense it feels like oh my gosh we are accelerating the benefit when in reality you have things offset the PAA as it rolls off. Mac McCullough : That\u2019s a great observation Marty, and we appreciate you pointing that out. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Thank you all. The first half of 2017 produced solid results, and as you can tell we are excited about our prospects to finish the second half of the year strong. The integration of FirstMerit is largely complete and we are now focused on the revenue upside. Our success with the integration accelerates the achievement of our long-term financial goals as we were just talking about, and our strategies are clearly working, our execution goals continues to drive good results, and we expect to continue to gain market share and growth share of wallet. So finally, I just want to reiterate that our board and management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priority is realizing revenue synergies from FirstMerit, as well as growing our core business.

We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let's get started by turning to slide 3 and an overview of the financials. Mac? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We are pleased with our third quarter financial performance including record net income for the second consecutive quarter, completion of the fiscal integration of FirstMerit, and substantial progress in the cultural integration of the two organizations. In addition, we incurred the final charge for the integration of FirstMerit in the third quarter of 2017. So, let's get started by turning to slide 3 to review third quarter results. Please keep in mind that year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the inclusion of FirstMerit as the acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2016. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.23 for the third quarter of 2017, up 109% over the year-ago quarter. This is inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition. Also including the impact of the significant items, return on assets was 1.08%; return on common equity was 10.5%; and return on tangible common equity was 14.1%. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 60.5%. However, net acquisition related expense added 2.8 percentage points to the ratio. Adjusting for the significant items, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.7%, and this reconciliation can be found on slide 20. Tangible book value per share increased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.85, and was up 2% sequentially from the second quarter. Consistent with our 2017 CCAR submission, last week, the board declared a dividend of $0.11 per share, a $0.03 or 38% increase from the $0.08 per share in the prior quarter. During the third quarter, we also repurchased $123 million of common stock, representing 9.6 million shares at an average cost of $12.75 per share. Turning to slide 4, which shows a summary of the income statement, total revenue was up 17% from the year-ago quarter. Net interest income was up 21% year-over-year due to the 17% increase in average earning assets primarily reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, and an 11 basis point increase in the net interest margin. Noninterest income increased 9% year-over-year. We continue to see good growth in service charges on deposit accounts and card and payment processing revenue, both of which reflect the impact of FirstMerit as well as organic customer acquisition and increased debit and credit card activity from existing customers. A record quarter in capital markets fees was driven by strong execution of our strategic focus on expanding the business and deepening commercial relationships. Noninterest expense decreased 4% year-over-year. Significant items both for 2017 and 2016 third quarter expenses. For the third quarter of 2017, acquisition-related expense totaled $31 million. Adjusted noninterest expense in the third quarter grew $97 million or 18% from the year-ago quarter, primarily from the inclusion of FirstMerit. Compared to the second quarter of 2017, adjusted noninterest expense increased $6 million or 1%. The third quarter of 2017 included approximately $12 million of nonrecurring expense not included in the significant items for the quarter. This $12 million of expense related to personnel, operational and efficiency improvement efforts, and certain expenses associated with the previously announced consolidation of 38 traditional branches, seven drive-through locations, and three corporate offices late in the third quarter of 2017. For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations contained on page 19 of the presentation slides or in the release. Slide 5 illustrates that we are well on our way to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2017. You are accustomed to hearing us talk about this every quarter stressing how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. We remain confident that 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year of positive operating leverage. Slide 6 illustrates our balance sheet trends. Average earning assets grew 17% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 31% increase in average securities and a 12% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases. The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit's portfolio; the reinvestment of cash flows, including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the 2016 fourth quarter; and additional investments in LCR ratio Level 1 qualifying securities. During the third quarter, average loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. As you have come to expect from us, we remain disciplined in our approach to the extension of credit. To emphasize this point, loan originations for each of the last three quarters were lower than our 2017 budget expectation. However, we more than made up for lower loan volumes through disciplined pricing, resulting in net favorability to year-to-date core net interest income. As Steve will elaborate on later in the presentation, we have reduced our period-end loan growth guidance for 2017 to a range of 3% to 4%. This new guidance assumes that we will not execute an auto securitization in 2017. As competition for loan growth continues to intensify, particularly on the commercial side, we are very pleased that the option to retain more of our high-quality auto loan origination volume as an earning asset substitute until we see competition in the commercial space become more rational. At quarter end, our indirect auto portfolio concentration represented 123% of Tier 1 capital plus ACL. This is just below our operating guideline of 125%, but still well below our concentration limit of 150%. Based on our current expectations, we have capacity for continued growth of the portfolio into mid-2018 while remaining below our 125% operating guideline. As you know, our auto loans are the best-performing loan category in our CCAR stress testing, and we originate the hold. So, we are very comfortable carrying on our balance sheet as opposed to chasing riskier loan growth elsewhere. We also like the effective duration and the risk return profile of these loans relative to alternative investment securities. Average C&I loans increased 11% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the FirstMerit acquisition as well as increases in core middle market, the specialty lending verticals, business banking, and auto floor plan. As we have seen throughout 2017, we continue to face headwinds in corporate banking as companies access the debt markets in order to lock-in current low rates. C&I balances were further impacted by payoffs and pay downs of certain nonperforming loans, helping to drive a 7% sequential decline in nonperforming assets. Average commercial real estate loans increased 13% year-over-year as a result of the FirstMerit acquisition. On a period-end basis, commercial real estate loans decreased 1% year-over-year. We have strategically pulled back in CRE lending, specifically in multifamily, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Average auto loans increased 3% year-over-year, with the third quarter representing another solid quarter of consistent disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 7% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.62% in the third quarter, up from 3.58% in the prior quarter, and up more than 40 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Average residential mortgage loans increased 20% year-over-year reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and continued strong demand from mortgages across our footprint. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo (10:05) mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Turning our attention to the chart on the right side of slide 7, average total deposits increased 17% from the year-ago quarter, including a 19% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 22% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase in low-cost DDA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit's low-cost deposit base, as well as our continuing focus on checking account relationship acquisition. Moving to slide 7, our net interest margin was 3.29% for the third quarter, up 11 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected a 26 basis point increase in earning asset yields and a 4 basis point increase in the benefit of noninterest-bearing funds balanced against a 19 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. On a link-quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 2 basis points driven by a 3 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and a 2 basis point increase in the benefit of noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset by a 7 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in funding cost was more heavily weighted to wholesale funding as we continue to remain pleased with our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing, especially on consumer core deposits where the rate increased 1 basis point sequentially. Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the net interest margin in the third quarter, down from 15 basis points in the prior quarter. After adjusting for this impact in all quarters, the Core NIM was 3.18% compared to 3.16% in the prior quarter and 3.06% in the third quarter of 2016. As I just mentioned and calling your attention to the orange line, at the bottom of the graph on the left, our cost of consumer core deposits was 22 basis points for the third quarter. This represents a 4 basis point increase over the year ago quarter and a 1 basis point increase sequentially, illustrating the strong consumer core deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing. We have seen consumer and small business deposit pricing remain relatively steady in the face of recent fed interest rate hikes. While the majority of pricing pressure has been limited to government banking, corporate banking and the upper end of middle market commercial. In the quarter, we selectively increased rates to grow and retain core deposit balances on certain corporate relationships providing better economics for the bank relative to the cost of wholesale funding. On an earning asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 41 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 35 basis points. On a linked-quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 3 basis points while consumer loan yields increased 5 basis points. Security yields were up 8 basis points year-over-year and were flat for the prior quarter. Slide 8 shows the expected pre-tax impacts of purchase accounting adjustments on an annual forward-looking basis. We introduced this slide last fall and believes it is useful when helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion and except for what we've experienced in the first three quarters of 2017, do not include in the accelerated accretion from the recapture through early payoffs or extensions in the projected periods. As we have stated previously, and it's been proven out in our result for the past five quarters, in reality, we are likely to experience loan extensions and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion. Therefore, you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars continue to be pulled forward as modifications and early payoffs occur. Turning to slide 9, this illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were set by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind, but we expect the economic benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition will allow us to achieve these long-term financial goals in the fourth quarter of 2017 run rate and for the full year 2018 both on a GAAP basis, two-plus years ahead of schedule. Year-to-date 2017 results on a reported GAAP basis reflect the cost of the ongoing integration. Adjusting for these costs, as shown on the reconciliation slides 23 and 24 in the appendix, we are already realizing the scale and financial benefits of the deal. The fourth column depicts our current expectations for these metrics for the full year 2017 also on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. I would point you in particular to our full-year expectations for the efficiency ratio and return on tangible common equity. We believe these results will distinguish our performance from our peers. We celebrated the one year anniversary of the closing of the FirstMerit acquisition in August, and slide 10 provides additional details on the cost savings and revenue synergies from the transaction. We have now fully implemented all of the $255 million of originally planned cost saves, and the primary focus of the organization is now executing on more than $100 million of revenue enhancement opportunities. Turning to slide 11. You should recognize this slide as well from our second quarter earnings call, which reiterates our $639 million noninterest expense target for the fourth quarter of 2017. With all cost savings implemented, we will deliver on our cost save commitment in the fourth quarter of 2017. The chart on the upper right details the fourth quarter run rate. The chart on the bottom of this page details the expense from implementing the revenue initiatives, specifically $37 million this year and an incremental $13 million in 2018. As I mentioned during last quarter's conference call, we expect the revenue initiatives to have an incremental efficiency ratio of approximately 50% in 2018. The incremental efficiency ratio was higher in 2017 as the ramp in revenues will naturally lag some of the up-front expense. You've also seen slide 12 before, which provides additional detail on the FirstMerit-related revenue enhancement opportunities. The bar chart on top of the slide displays our current targets for additional revenue from the initiatives. In 2017, the revenue ramp corresponds with the hiring that is necessary to increase production and grow the portfolios. For 2018, we are targeting at least $100 million of total revenue enhancements. This is a $52 million increase from the $48 million expected in 2017. Slide 13 illustrates the continued progress we've made in rebuilding our capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.94%, up 85 basis points year-over-year. We have previously mentioned that our operating guideline for common equity Tier 1 is in the range of 9% to 10%. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.42%, up 28 basis points year-over-year. Moving to slide 14. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. We booked provision expense of $44 million in the third quarter compared to net charge-offs of $43 million. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 25 basis points of average loans and leases, which remained below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were up 4 basis points from the prior quarter and down 1 basis point from the year-ago quarter. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased 1 basis point linked-quarter to 1.10%, but the nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 223% as a result of the 7% linked-quarter decline in nonaccrual loans. Overall asset quality metrics remained strong. Nonperforming assets decreased to $28 million or 7% linked-quarter. The nonperforming asset ratio eased 5 basis points sequentially to 56 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased 14 basis points from 3.66% to 3.80%. And our 90-day-plus delinquencies declined slightly. We also continue to expect \u2013 to experience lower nonperforming asset inflows for the fourth quarter in a row. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Mac. Moving to the economy, slide 16 illustrates selective key economic indicators for our footprint. As we've noted previously, our footprint has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery of the last several years, and I remain optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our footprint, and as you can see, unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint remain near historical lows. Slide 17 illustrates trends in unemployment rates for our 10 largest deposit markets. Many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment at the end of August. The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong with several markets such as here in Columbus and in Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see meaningful labor shortages. We have noted previously that we're seeing wage inflation in our expense base, and our customers are too. Housing markets across the footprint continue to display broad-based home price inflation while remaining some of the most affordable markets in the U.S. Finally, we continue to see optimism across our consumer and business customer base with the consumer confidence score in our region at its highest since 2000. These economic factors support our expectation for continued economic growth across our footprint through the \u2013 though the recent translation into business investment has been somewhat uneven. Let's now turn to slide 18 for some closing remarks and important messages. With another good quarter in the third quarter, including record net income, the core franchise continues to perform very well on many fronts, and we have completed the remaining necessary integration actions for us to achieve the economics of the FirstMerit deal. We were pleased to significantly increase our cash dividend for the fourth consecutive year, and to reinstitute our buyback program. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term, and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As Mac noted, the FirstMerit acquisition accelerated our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals. And with the integration substantially complete, we expect to deliver against the goal in this year as well as next year. We are set to realize our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition with all remaining cost savings implemented during the third quarter as originally communicated. We also continue to execute on the significant revenue enhancement opportunities including the SBA lending, home lending, and RV and marine lending expansions. Our 2017 full year outlook continues to expect total revenue growth of 23% on a GAAP basis. Consistent with our long-term financial goal, we are targeting annual positive operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to appropriately manage our expenses within our revenue outlook. We expect average balance sheet growth also in excess of 20%. We expect period end loan growth of 3% to 4% for the full-year 2017. Consumer loan growth has remained steady throughout 2017. Consistent with our experience over the past several years, we expect commercial loan growth for the remainder of the year to outpace what we experienced year-to-date. However, our commercial pipelines remained strong. However, the commercial lending environment is extremely competitive on both structures and rate. We've reduced our overall 2017 loan growth expectations from previous guidance. We're remaining discipline with our aggregate moderate to low-risk appetite, ensuring appropriate returns on capital. Finally, we expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Now, I'll turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark? Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Michelle, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed with your question. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP : Good morning, guys. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Scott. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Scott. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP : Mac, I had a quick question, just on the \u2013 holding relatively more auto than you might have, where the commercial environment not as it is. So, just first, can you walk through any margin ramifications of putting on auto versus what it would been had C&I been playing out as expected? And then, did pricing in the \u2013 either sale or securitization market, did that have anything to do with the decision to keep on balance sheet? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Scott. So, yeah, I would tell you that there really wasn't any consideration given the pricing and the securitization market. As I've said historically, I do think we always give up economics when we securitize, like having these assets on our balance sheet because of their performance through the CCAR process, as well as the risk adjusted yield that we get on the auto book. I would tell you that any margin impact on a go-forward basis is immaterial relative to C&I loan growth. We feel comfortable with the returns that we get on the auto book, and we are well within the operating guideline even through mid-2018. So, we're prepared to be able to do that, and we're very comfortable keeping the assets. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then, can you just remind me, you guys don't pop the marine and RV into the concentration limits, right, like your limit is auto specifically as opposed to all indirect. And then, along those lines, what is the opportunity you guys see on like marine and RV and how's the pricing there vis-\u00e0-vis auto or other indirect portfolios? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Okay. Hey, Scott. This is Dan. So, you're correct. The auto concentration limit is just for auto. We have a separate limit for boat and RV. And we really like the boat and RV book. We think that is a real plus that we picked up through the acquisition, a business model and a team that are very skilled. We've supplemented that with external hires who have experience in the business. The profile of our customer there is very strong, FICOs of 790 to 795. The asset size of the boats and RVs that they're purchasing is in a range we're very comfortable with. We're talking $75,000 average size of the vehicle. These tend to be experienced boat and RV owners. And given that profile, the returns are strong as well. So, just on the whole, very nice asset class for us. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP : Okay. All right. That sounds great. Thank you, guys, very much. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Thanks for clarifying that $12 million in the third quarter. So, the question about forward expenses, the $639 million run rate that you've held to now, can you just help us think about what that means as a starting point going forward? And is there anything else that you're contemplating to continue to hold up a gap on operating leverage in addition to the cost saves you've seen already? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So Ken, it's Mac. So, as we've stated in the press release and in the scripts, we're very comfortable achieving the $639 million target in the fourth quarter. I think if you adjust for the $12 million in the third quarter, you can see that, pretty much already there. And we've talked about what that means on a go-forward basis. Clearly, we've got opportunity to recognize the full amount of the cost save in 2018 because we did not recognize the full cost save for full year 2017. So we do expect to recognize some of that benefit going forward as well. And back on operating leverage, we are committed to positive operating leverage. This will be the fifth year in a row that we're going to achieve it. This is an important goal for us, and we build our plan every year understanding what the revenue opportunity is, thinking about basically a flat rate environment and then building our expense base to provide positive operating leverage on a go-forward basis. So, very committed to that objective and feel confident that we're going to deliver that. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And my second question is, this is the second quarter in a row where you have not built the provision on top of charge-offs. As you had indicated, you would've been doing post-merger as loans move from the FirstMerit book into the regular way book. Is that now a thing of the past or are we now matching from here provisions and charge-offs? And what would change from here, if not? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. This is Dan. So, I think what you've seen the last couple of quarters is not what you would expect on a go-forward basis. There are a lot of factors at play when we look at the ACL in a given quarter. We have been aided recently by a big reduction sequentially in our NPAs. I don't expect that type of reduction to continue. So, that has certainly contributed. Those are loans that would have large reserves attached to them. And I think at 49 basis points of non-accrual loans, that certainly is below what we would expect even in these times. And so, I think that's a factor we have to take into account. So, as I referenced last quarter, I think the way to think about provision on a go-forward basis is covering charge-offs plus some addition for growth. So, I think what you've seen the last couple of quarters is not \u2013 that is not the norm and not what you should expect on a go-forward basis. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Just a quick clarification there then, Dan. NPAs might not be going down, but what would be replacing the charge-offs in terms of what's underlying? There's positive trends in delinquencies and all the back stuff. So, why would you see any inflection on even the charge-off side? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think there's going to be movement from quarter-to-quarter, and I think we've had some very positive movements. We've said \u2013 over time, we do expect \u2013 we've been operating below our long-term goal on charge-offs for quite some time, and I think very gradually we are going to see that drift upwards. So, I think that's another element at work here. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Jon. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Maybe, Steve or Dan, a question for you on some of your commercial lending comments. Can you just maybe give us an idea of where and what is bothering you, is it large corporate middle market, is it linked into small business and then what you think might change that environment? Is that something you expect to improve at all next year? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. This is Steve. We have had a good year in terms of consumer loans, mortgage, home equity, RV/marine, auto, across the board. So, we're running sort of spot year-to-date, 7% to 8% on that combination of the portfolio. So, that has shown a consistency quarter-to-quarter and good performance. Our middle market lending has grown year-to-date, up 2% to 3%. So, what we've been fighting is headwinds coming off of our large corporate. And it's essentially a combination of fixed income activity, and there's a little bit of upsizing on a dynamic that's been new this year where the number of banks involved in certain relationships are being reduced just so the cross-sell can be provided. I'd add to that that market in particular has gotten extraordinarily competitive, terms, rates, et cetera. And so, to some extent, we have backed out of that in ways that we might not have \u2013 in ways we wouldn't have previously. Finally, commercial real estate market also is frothy. And we have, as you heard from Mac, we actually have pulled back a percent year-over-year and we have constrained it in a couple of lending types, property types, on purpose. And we're a bit cautious in some of our markets, in particular in those asset categories. So, again, we're long-term shareholders. We're locked in. We have this discipline around aggregate moderate-to-low. If we don't like to return risk profile, we're just not going to go-forward with it. We'll look to do other things, hold the capital or asset substitute, whatever we think is more prudent than just follow the parade. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Erika. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Erika. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just wanted to ask about the other side of the balance sheet. You've been able to keep core deposits very low through this rate tightening cycle. And I'm wondering as we look into next year, how is competition in your footprint shaping up in terms of pricing competition for retail and SME versus larger or middle market corporate? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Erika, so we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to accomplish in the \u2013 with core deposits in particular from a repricing perspective. I think the slide 7 actually shows some really good trends in terms of what we've done with our core commercial and core consumer deposits. And I think, you just have to go back and think about the strategy that we put in place around fair play and, I think, some of the benefits that we have with our customers around the experience that we deliver, and the number of awards that we've won that I think illustrate the loyalty and satisfaction that our customers have for us. Having said that, we do see a very rational environment in our footprint. We certainly see competitors doing testing of different products and different pricing. And you see pilots or test take place and you see them pull back. So, I would say that what we see is very rational, and we do expect that to continue. Everyone is in good shape from a liquidity perspective. I think the lack of asset growth is also not requiring that excessive price be paid to raise deposits. And I think that we'll just monitor and make sure that we're testing and piloting different products and different pricing opportunities as well, so that we're ready in case something does change, but we see what is happening in our footprint to be very rational. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for that. And as a follow-up, I heard you loud and clear, Steve, about commercial real estate concern, and I think a lot of investors share that concern with you. I'm wondering, as we try to benchmark the industry for commercial real estate credit next year, Dan, is it possible for you to share some of your underwriting standards really sort of origination debt service coverage ratio minimums, and at what interest rate you set that debt service coverage ratio to? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Sure. So, one, our underwriting standards haven't really changed, although, recently we probably have tightened up a little bit in terms of some of the equity requirements going in. but generally, you're going to be looking at a 75% to 80% type LTV. In multifamily, we've actually gone lower in some instances particularly in those markets where we think there may have been over building, but we're looking at a debt-service coverage ratio in the 125 range. We stress those rates at about 6.25%, 30-year amortization. And then on top of that, with the vast majority of our \u2013 once we have personal recourse. And so, very \u2013 very stable underwriting requirements, that as I said, have either maintained or tightened modestly over the last couple of years. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Our core customer base still is less than 300 relationships in commercial real estate to give you a sense of the granularity of it and the consistency of strategy. Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. And, Erika, I would also add that one thing, this is all built on what we call our Tier 1 developers is the majority of who we're lending to. So, we're looking very closely at their global cash flow, their liquidity, and their net worth because in addition to underwriting the individual properties, we are counting on the fact that they have the wherewithal to support our loans in a downturn. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. I guess when you think about loan growth, obviously, you did take your guidance down, and it sounds like commercial is pretty challenging broadly speaking. But when we think about the factors that are driving this sort of low single-digit growth this year, are there any changes or what do you expect to change next year in terms of the same factors? Like, would you expect the commercial environment to get better or auto to accelerate or vice versa? I'm just trying to get a sense of like what changes the longer term growth outlook for the best? Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: This has been a very unusual year, I think, for commercial lending. At least in my career, I haven't seen one where you have GDP expansion sort of increasing over the course of the year and commercial loan activity, for an extended period, being flat to down as you look at that HA data. So, we believe that a combination of factors, but principally related to uncertainty around policy issues and timing are having an impact on marginal investment. And so, as we think about the next year and beyond, we're optimistic that these policy issues are going to get addressed, and that will be stimulative on the whole. And we like what we see in terms of the activity and planning in our footprint. There's a lot of investment contemplated. We've never had as much foreign direct inquiry in most of the markets we're in as we're experiencing today. The diversification of the economy here sets up I think a series of opportunities as we think about 2018 and beyond. So, we're bullish in terms of outlook, Ken, and think that once these policy issues get addressed, the clarity will help unlock some of what's been restrained this year. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. I will definitely keep my fingers crossed about policy clarity going forward. So, thank you very much. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Good morning, John. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : On that same topic, given what you just mentioned about the policy reticence that some borrowers may have, how much of this pullback in your loan growth expectation is it all influenced by some softening on the front-end side, on demand? So, is that apprehension of borrowers changing? Is it getting worse and that influence some of your pullback in your growth expectation or is it primarily the things you already flagged in terms of CRE and cap markets and competitive pressures? Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Well, we think much of the cap market activity has occurred so that, we believe, is abating. But we do see while the tax code revisions are pending, the range of deferred activities. If you're going to sell a business, trying to figure out how to (41:35) this year or next, et cetera, for example. So, we consciously pulled back on commercial real estate this year and especially this past quarter. We just did not like the risk return profiles as we were looking out into 2019 and beyond when a number of these loans would be coming out of construction and leasing. So, that was our decision, but there are broader market impacts that are much more policy-related at this point, John. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then, I guess another way to get \u2013 to dig there is do you have updated line utilization data for the quarter? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Basically flat on the commercial side for the quarter. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. All right. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, auto is typically at a seasonal low with model change-out. So, we have this every year but, overall, on a flat. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Got it. Got it. And then, one last thing also to beat the loan growth dead horse. On 2018, how do you think about the pace of where loan growth could go? Is it going to \u2013 if you think of it is in this low 3% to 4% range, is it \u2013 should we think about it in terms of GDP or multiple of GDP? How should we think about that? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: We think of it as a low multiple of GDP. We got consumer going up 7% to 8% year-to-date, middle market up 2% to 3% year-to-date on spots. A lot of the corporate bond activity we think has occurred, so we think it's stabilizing now. Pipeline looks \u2013 actually, commercial pipeline looks good in this quarter. So, if we can get the tax policy issue addressed, I think that opens up the spigot to some extent, this deferral we hope will spur incremental activity, almost like a burst of activity, John. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thank you. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining-Sparks. Please proceed with your question. Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.: Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.: Hey. Good morning. Slide 8 is \u2013 I've told you several times, I don't like the way that that presents the results. When you look at the decline in the net benefit from $73 million to $19 million, that's about a $50 million decline, that when you're just looking at this one slide by itself, but when you roll over and you look at slides 11 and 12, what you're then showing is that the synergies of the deal, the revenue side generates about $50 million and if you take about $100 million of net spillover into next year from what you get on the expense synergies, that $50 million really gets just kind of like a prepayment to the positives that you're getting out of the synergies. So, am I thinking of that right in a sense of netting out those two things when you really get to the bottom-line impact as you go from 2017 into 2018? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah, Marty. I think you're absolutely right on that point. We like slide 8 because it does give some visibility into what's happening with the margin in particular. And obviously fighting through some of the noise in the margin is important as we communicate the message, and I think slide 8 has been effective. But I do appreciate, you continue to point out the fact that the synergies are definitely offsetting that impact. Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.: And the other thing that I was thinking about was, when you show the revenue enhancements, you're leaving out one of the bigger pieces which is, when you actually made the acquisition you weren't really paying for or anticipating that rates were going to go up. And as rates have now started to move higher, there is a benefit of the margin on the FirstMerit deposits was something that you really weren't counting on, which is a revenue enhancement. And I think the end result of that is when you look at your return on tangible common equity target it was 13% to 15%. You're saying you're already going to be at 15% and you kind of roll these net benefits into 2018, I think you're kind of rounding up to around 16% as you look into next year. So, I think some of that delta on the favorable could just be out of the deposits that you're being able to get the profitability from. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: That's another great point. I think one of the real benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition was the quality of the core deposit base. On the retail side, in particular, but also in the commercial side. And tremendous value creation, if you think about that, that deposit base and where the rate environment is going. So clearly, a big benefit to the value of the transaction, and we probably should talk about that more. Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.: And just humor one last question, if you think of the credit, your guidance kind of assumes the \u2013 kind of just a general deterioration, but there's really nothing in the portfolio that suggest charge-offs in the low 20 should be mid-30s until we kind of get some deterioration. So, is this really just kind of a general over the cycle, we're going to be somewhere in this 35 basis points to 55 basis points? And really if you look at where we're at and that this current environment sustains itself, isn't there an opportunity to remain below that guided range for a period of time? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Marty, this is Dan. I do believe that we will remain below the range. Although, one thing to keep in mind is even if gross charge-offs don't increase materially, the recoveries that we have available to us are shrinking just because we have not had significant charge-offs over the last few years. So, I think that's one component, that again, I think the increase will be modest and gradual. But nonetheless, I don't think it's reasonable to anticipate that we're going to sustain these levels long term. Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.: Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Marty. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Marty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emlen Harmon with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Emlen Harmon - JMP Securities LLC : Good morning. Steve, could you \u2013 hey \u2013 Steve, could you talk a little bit about your appetite for M&A with FirstMerit effectively kind of fully integrated here? And what kind of opportunity you would need to see to be interested? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Well, let's back up, we completed the expense side of this. But as we have been sharing, we have a lot of revenue synergy, and that is not complete. And there's also the full assimilation, the culture getting the company set, so we're very, very focused. Our first priority is to get that FirstMerit revenue as we go through 2018. Emlen Harmon - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then if John kind of beat the dead horse on loan demand, I'm going to maybe kick it a little bit. But you mentioned a few times tax reform as a hang-up on demand. Seems like we've also got just kind of building uncertainty regarding the country status in NAFTA at least as far as the headlines are concerned. I guess, with Michigan and Ohio, two of the bigger exporters to North America, have you guys kind of \u2013 are you guys talking to your borrower base at all just in terms of how that's impacting demand for those borrowers and if you thought about just on exposure there of the exporting community? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: That's a great point. There's clearly an impact in our footprint. There's a sense of optimism that the NAFTA negotiations are going to get to a rational conclusion. So, I would start with that. And I think I mentioned this earlier, auto is going to have its fifth best year, we believe, in history. So, there's a stability on some of the engines here as we think about going forward. And then, the diversification of the economy, just the sheer scale of the economies in our footprint are huge factors that help contribute to our optimism in terms of going forward. Emlen Harmon - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Emlen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Steve today. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hi, Kyle. Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: I wondered if you could touch on the NIM outlook, both kind of the core and the GAAP in the fourth quarter given that it looks like accretion will take a leg down here. I guess are we looking at maybe a stable-ish core NIM, and then kind of GAAP goes down with the \u2013 given the accretion or how should we think about that? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. I would say that we're going to continue to see the reported NIM decline because accretion is going to change or decline from here. But I think the core NIM is going to continue to expand even in a flat rate environment assumption that we're making. So, really, fourth quarter will fall into that trend, I believe. And as we move into 2018 even in the unchanged rate scenario, I think we see expansion in the core. Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. So, I guess to follow up on that, is the core expansion, is that mix shift or are you guys seeing favorable pricing, or kind of what's driving the core NIM expansion in a flat rate environment? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. So, we basically just have asset portfolios being replaced at higher yields as we see runoff and replacement, so we're originating at higher yields relative to where we were a year ago. So, I think that's the primary driver in what we're seeing. Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. And is that \u2013 that's both on the loans and securities or just one or the other? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Both categories, loans and securities. Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: All right. Great. Thank you, guys. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Kyle. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Good morning, Dave. David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Moving to liability side of the balance sheet, looking at deposits, you guys had a very good quarter there on the deposit growth. And I wanted to see if you could talk about any promotions or changes in pricing that may have impacted the growth there, and then given the slowdown in loan expectations, what you'd expect out of that deposit growth going forward. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Dave, it's Mac. So, I would say nothing really in the way of promotions we did, and I mentioned this in the script. We did look at some pricing on the commercial side in order to grow some of our balances there and retain some balances that we thought was a good tradeoff relative to wholesale funding. So, I would tell you that, on the margin, we probably did increase price on the commercial side in the quarter. But we saw a nice benefit from doing that relative to the cost of wholesale funding. And going forward, I would tell you that I think it's stable and steady in terms of what we've seen, and how we think about the funding from a core perspective on both the consumer and the commercial side going forward. That will depend, of course, on what happens with the Fed and when we see rate increases, if we see rate increases, but as I mentioned earlier, we see our market being very rational from a pricing perspective, and not a lot of pressure on the liquidity side right now. David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks for the color, Mac. That's all I have. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Terry. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Within the original FirstMerit merger model, you assumed a 3%, call it, core increase in annual operating expenses, and as we think about 2018, is that still a good number to use as it relates to just core growth? And then, could you help me understand the seasonality on the expense line next year? Will there be a bump up in maybe the first half of the year, and then drift lower implying maybe 4Q 2018 would be below that of the earlier quarters of the year? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah, Terry. So, we're working through 2018 right now, and I think the way we think about building a budget we start with an unchanged rate environment, and we get the revenue side of the equation right based upon where we see loan growth coming in, and obviously, some of the investments we've made in FirstMerit and fee income categories. And then, we determine what we can spend from an expense perspective based on the investments that we want to make. And we do continue to make the right investments in the business. And of course, we go the normal cost associated with our colleagues in infrastructure and the whole nine yards. So we did assume 3% in the FirstMerit merger model. That's not a bad number to think about on a long-term basis. As I mentioned earlier, we do get additional benefits from the cost take-outs on a full-year basis in 2018. So that should be considered as well. On a seasonality basis, we typically see higher expenses in the second quarter and that has to do with a couple of things. We have the Merit change for our colleagues in the second quarter. We also have some onetime impacts from compensation, equity compensation hitting in the second quarter as well. And then, typically, the first quarter is a little bit lower than the third and the fourth quarters. So, it's, I would say, lower in the first, higher in the second, and then, from a seasonality perspective, probably drifting down in the third and fourth, this is the way to think about it. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then just one question \u2013 follow-up question. The 38 branches and drive-through locations that were consolidated in the third quarter. Was that originally part of the FirstMerit transaction in the $255 million of cost saves. And I guess the reason I ask is, I didn't see those expenses taken out in the press release in terms of call them a merger and acquisition-related expense. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah, Terry. Those were not a part of the original $255 million. When we announced this, we did disclose that we're reinvesting a good portion of the savings there back into digital and our colleagues. So, I wouldn't expect that you would see a material impact in the run rate from that transaction. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks again. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Terry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. You brought up the net charge-off guidance, 1 basis point, not a big deal, but you also saw your classified loans to move higher a bit here. Could you just talk about the overall environment for credit and your expectations into 4Q and then into 2018? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yes. So, I think \u2013 this is Dan. I think expectations are fairly stable. We've seen, as you noted, criticized did go up in the quarter, but that didn't incorporate the SNC (57:48) results from the most recent review. We continue to feel we have a very proactive and conservative risk rating. And I think that's underscored by the fact that you haven't seen the migration into nonaccruals, and then ultimately into charge-offs. So, while the criticized loans were up, still feel that the portfolio is in really good shape, although we're at historic lows in many of our metrics. And I think that, as I mentioned earlier with less recoveries on the charge-off front, that is \u2013 we're going to see a mild and gradual increase there. But, overall, we feel very good about the portfolio and look for stability in the quarters to come. Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then, a follow-up on some of the revenue growth numbers or at least in the loan growth that questions have been asked. In regards to your ability to continue to generate operating leverage going into 2018, do you still require some type of loan growth in the mid-single digits or can you continue to generate that operating leverage given the expense saving programs that you have in place even if loan growth comes in at the lower end of your expectations? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin, I believe we can continue to generate positive operating leverage. And in particular, in 2018, you have to consider the revenue synergies that we're getting out of FirstMerit. Investments we've made in the fee income businesses in particular on the Huntington side there that are taking hold. And we do continue to have good consumer loan growth of very high quality and attractive growth rates. So, feel confident that we'll see positive operating leverage. Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thank you. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Good morning, Peter. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Just given the comments that you're a little bit more cautious on commercial real estate and you've had good success expanding the indirect auto into other markets. Is that something that you would \u2013 you think about ramping up that expansion of the indirect auto going to newer markets? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Peter, it's Steve Steinour. We like the footprint presence we have. We do not anticipate expanding into any new markets at this time. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, just very quickly, follow-up. Can you talk about how it's going in the newer markets of Chicago and Wisconsin, and are you seeing more potential revenue opportunities there? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Well, we do see growth and revenue opportunities. We've had a very good start to small business lending, SBA lending, in particular, we're number two in Chicago, on units and dollars, and number two and three in Wisconsin on units and dollars, and that's from a zero start. So that has ramped up quickly. Our residential mortgage lending is ramping up. We'll be adding to the team, including in the fourth quarter on resi mortgage. We like what we have seen from the commercial teams. We had some great talent joining us from FirstMerit, so feel really pleased with how that team is performing, the commercial teams, how they're performing. And then the branches themselves, the consumer businesses, are doing well and holding deposits and growing our customer base. So, pleased with the positions we've inherited in both states. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Peter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for any closing remarks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, we produced solid results in the third quarter and I'm confident we're going to finish the year strong. Our strategies are working and the execution of our goals continue to drive positive results. We expect to continue to gain market share and grow share of wallet. Our top priorities are growing our core businesses and realizing the revenue synergies from FirstMerit. The integration of FirstMerit is substantially complete with the announced expense reductions fully implemented. We expect the fourth quarter run rate to demonstrate these benefits, and we expect to achieve all of our long-term financial goals in the fourth quarter of 2017 and into 2018. Finally, I always like to include a reminder that there's high level of alignment between the board, management and our colleagues, and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively one of the largest shareholders of Huntington. We have hold the retirement requirements on certain shares, so we will continue to proactively manage risks and volatility and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. Thank you all for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

Davidson Terry McEvoy - Stephens, Inc. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Huntington Bancshares\u2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mark Muth : Thank you, Melissa. Welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we\u2019ll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call. As noted on slide two, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Mac for an overview of the financials. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance including record net income for the third consecutive quarter and the accelerated achievement of all five of our long-term financial goals in the quarter. As I turn to slide three to review full year results, please keep in mind that comparisons to 2016 are impacted by the inclusion of FirstMerit, at the acquisition close, during the third quarter of 2016. We reported earnings per common share of $1 for full year 2017, up 43% over 2016. This includes $0.09 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition and $0.11 per share of reasonably estimated benefit from federal tax reform. Also including the impact of the significant items, return on assets was 1.17%, return on common on equity was 11.6% and return on common equity was 15.7%. Turning to slide four. We reported earnings per common share of $0.37 for the fourth quarter, up 85% over the year ago quarter. This includes $0.11 per share of reasonably estimated benefit from federal tax reform. Also including the impact of significant items, return on assets was 1.67%, return on common equity was 17% and return on tangible common equity was 22.7%. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 54.9%. As a reminder, this is the first quarter since the acquisition of FirstMerit that we did not incur merger-related expense, having completed the physical integration of FirstMerit in the third quarter of 2017. Tangible book value per share increased 2% sequentially and 8% year-over-year to $6.97 per share. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $137 million of common stock, representing 9.8 million shares at an average cost of $14 per share. Turning to slide five. Total revenue was up 4% from the year ago quarter. Net interest income was up 5% year-over-year due to a 3% increase in average earning assets and a 5% basis-point increase in the net interest margin. Noninterest income increased 2% year-over-year on strength in capital markets fees, card and payment processing revenue, and trust and investment management fees, partially offset by a reduction in gains on the sale of loans related to the balance sheet optimization strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Noninterest expense decreased 7% year-over-year due entirely to $53 million of significant items expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the integration of FirstMerit versus no significant items expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the significant items, noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew $5 million or 1% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of annual compensation increases. For a closer look at the details behind the calculations, please refer to the reconciliations contained on pages 21 and 22 of the presentation slides or in the release. Slide six illustrates that we delivered positive operating leverage again in 2017. This is an important annual goal for us and we are pleased that we accomplished this for the fifth consecutive year. Turning to slide seven. Average earning assets grew 3% from the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in average securities and a 4% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases, which were partially offset by a reduction in held for sale assets due to the balance sheet optimization strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in average securities reflects the reinvestment of cash flows including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the fourth quarter of 2016 and additional investments and liquidity coverage ratio Level 1 qualifying securities. Average C&I loans decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the headwinds in corporate banking, discussed in the first three quarters of 2017. While not impacting average balances materially, the C&I balances ended the quarter on a strong note with a period-end balances up 2.3% or just over 9% annualized versus the prior quarter-end. We saw the bulk of the growth in the final few weeks of the quarter, likely in part resulting from the removal of uncertainty regarding federal tax reform, coupled with a normal late quarter growth in commercial loans that we have experienced for the past few years. Average commercial real estate loans were flat year-over-year as we have strategically tightened CRE lending, specifically in multifamily, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Average auto loans increased to 10% year-over-year, with the fourth quarter representing another solid quarter of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 9% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.52% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.62% in the prior quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the normal seasonal mix shift to new car sales in the fourth quarter. Average RV and marine loans increased 30% year-over-year, reflecting the successful expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past year. Note that the fourth quarter is seasonally the weakest for loan production in this business but this quarter\u2019s production exceeded the business plan and we remain optimistic for growth in 2018. Average residential mortgage loans increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong demand for mortgages across our footprint as well as the benefit of our ongoing investments in former FirstMerit geographies, particularly Chicago. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. On a period-end basis, total loans increased 5% from a year-ago, driven by strength in consumer lending. Turning attention to the chart on the right side of slide seven, average total deposits increased 1% from the year-ago quarter, including a 3% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 4% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the trend in core deposits, particularly the increase in low cost DDA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit\u2019s low cost deposit base as well as our continuing focus on checking account relationship acquisition. The decline in period-end total deposits from the prior quarter was primarily due to seasonal decreases in government banking and expected fluctuations within our specialty banking deposit relationships. Moving to slide eight. Our net interest margin was 3.30% for the fourth quarter, up 5 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects a 23 basis-point increase in earning asset yields and a 7 basis-point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing funds balanced against, a 25 basis-point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Importantly, our cost of core interest-bearing deposits was only up 12 basis points. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 1 basis point, driven by a 5 basis-point improvement in earning asset yields and a 1 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing funds, partially offset by a 5 basis-point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The increase in funding cost was more heavily weighted to wholesale funding as we continue to remain pleased with our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing, especially on core consumer deposits where the rate paid remained flat sequentially. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 10 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter, down from 12 basis points in the prior quarter. After adjusting for purchase accounting accretion in all quarters, the core NIM was 3.20% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.18% in the prior quarter and 3.07% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth in core NIM over the past year has more than offset the reduction in the benefit from purchase accounting accretion. As I just mentioned and calling your attention to the orange line at the bottom of the graph on the left, our cost of core consumer deposits was 22 basis points for the fourth quarter. This represents a 4 basis-point increase over the year-ago quarter and was flat sequentially, illustrating the strong core consumer deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing. We have seen consumer and business banking deposit pricing remain relatively steady in the face of recent fed interest rate hikes with the majority of pricing pressure being limited to government banking, corporate banking and the upper end of commercial middle market. In the quarter, we selectively increased rates to grow and retain core deposit balances on certain corporate relationships, providing better economics for the bank relative to the cost of wholesale funding. On the earning asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 37 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 18 basis points. On a linked-quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 8 basis points while consumer loan yields decreased 1 basis point, primarily related to the impact of purchase accounting. Security yields were up 6 basis points year-over-year and were up 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Moving to slide nine. We expanded the information provided regarding the impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2017 and 2018 at a recent conference and we have updated it here. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide, which are the green bars, are based on current scheduled accretion. And except for what we experienced in 2017, we do not include any accelerated accretion from recapture from early payoffs or extensions in the projected period. As we have stated previously, it has been proven out in our results for past six quarters, in reality, we\u2019re likely to experience loan extensions and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion. Therefore, you\u2019re likely to see the accretion revenue schedule for 2018 continue to be put forward as modifications of early payoffs occur. Purchase accounting accretion is currently expected to represent a net interest income headwind of approximately $62 million in 2018 compared to 2017. However, majority of the $62 million decline in purchase accounting revenue is expected to be offset by a $41 million reduction in provision expense related to the acquired FirstMerit loans which is shown in the yellow bars. Importantly, as we think about quality of earnings, looking at the two circled orange bars, the net impact of pretax income from purchase accounting was approximately $13 million in 2017 and is currently expected to decline only $3 million in 2018. Turning to slide 10, let\u2019s take a look at the progress against our long-term financial goals which were approved by the Board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind, yet we achieved these long-term financial goals on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the realization of the economic benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition. Fourth quarter 2017 results on a reported GAAP basis reflect the benefit of federal tax reform. Even with adjusting for this benefit, as shown on slide 27 in the appendix, we are realizing the scale and financial benefits of the acquisition. We are proud to have achieved all five of our long-term financial goals this quarter on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Full year 2017 results on a reported GAAP basis reflect the cost of the FirstMerit integration and the tax benefit. Adjusting for these items, as shown on slide 26 and 27 in the appendix, we are already meeting the targets on an annual basis. Importantly, we expect to achieve all five financial goals on the GAAP basis for full year 2018, two years ahead of schedule. We have recently begun our 2018 strategic planning process and we\u2019ll be sharing new long-term financial goals for the Company later this year. Slide 11 highlights the FirstMerit-related cost savings and strategic revenue and synergies. As promised, we are fully realizing the original announced $255 million of annualized cost savings as evidenced by beating our $639 million noninterest expense target for the fourth quarter of 2017. Going forward, our focus is on executing the FirstMerit deal-related revenue enhancement opportunities. In 2017, we realized revenue of $48 million and expense of $36 million on these initiatives. The initiatives remain on track to deliver more than $100 million of revenue in 2018 with an efficiency ratio of 50%. These projections are included in our 2018 guidance. Early success and the introduction of the full Huntington product suite through our optimal customer relationship strategy and the strong results from SBA, RV and marine and home lending expansions provide optimism for continued revenue growth. Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios and a successful replenishment of our capital following the FirstMerit acquisition. Common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1, ended the quarter at 9.89% up 33 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, our operating guideline for CET1 is 9% to 10%. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.34%, up 18 basis points year-over-year. Moving to slide 13. I want to draw your attention to the fact that for the first time our Series A convertible preferred is included in our fully diluted common shares calculation, since the conversion would actually be dilutive earnings per share albeit by an immaterial amount. This is why average fully diluted common shares increased by approximately 24 million shares from the third quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2017. On a separate and unrelated note, our common stock is currently trading at a level that would allow us to force mandatory conversion of the Series A convertible preferred as early as February 9th. The potential conversion would have a positive impact on our tangible common equity capital ratio and our CET1 capital ratio with an immaterial impact on earnings per share. Should the conversion happen, we would take the opportunity to optimize our capital ratios, subject to non-objection in the 2018 CCAR submission. Moving to slide 14. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent, prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles. And our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. We booked provision expense of $65 million in the fourth quarter compared to net charge-offs of $41 million. Net charge-offs represent an annualized 24 basis points of average loans and leases, which remain below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down 1 basis point from the prior quarter and down 2 basis points from the year ago quarter. As usual, there is an additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased 1 basis point linked-quarter to 1.11%, and the non-accrual loan coverage ratio remained flat at 223%. Turning to slide 15. Overall asset quality metrics remain strong. Nonperforming assets increased $2 million or 1% linked-quarter. The NPA ratio eased 1 basis point sequentially to 55 basis points. The criticized asset ratio decreased 27 basis points from 3.80% to 3.53%. And our 90-day delinquencies slightly declined. NPA inflows increased 4 basis points. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Mac. Moving to the economy, slides 16 and 17 illustrate selected key economic indicators for our footprint. And as we\u2019ve noted previously, our footprint states have outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery for the last several years. And I remain optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states. The bottom left chart on slide 16 and the chart on slide 17 illustrate trends in unemployment rates across our footprint. And as you can see, unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint remained near historical lows. The labor markets in our footprint have proven to be strong with several markets such as here in Columbus, in Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see meaningful labor shortages. We have noted previously that we\u2019re seeing wage inflation in our expense base and certainly our customers are as well. Housing markets across our footprint continue to display broad-based home price inflation while remaining some of the most affordable markets throughout the U.S. Consumer confidence in our region is at its highest level since 2000. And perhaps more importantly, I would like to direct your attention to the map on the bottom right of slide 16 which illustrates the Philadelphia fed\u2019s state leading indicator indices for our footprint. These leading indicators point toward a very favorable economic operating environment in 2018 as six of our eight states are expected to see an acceleration in economic activity over the next six months. The optimism illustrated by the leading indicators, confirm our own optimism which is based on the daily interactions our bankers have with our small business, commercial and consumer customers. Our customer calling efforts have found widespread confidence across all of these customer segments. Our loan pipelines remain good including our commercial and business pipelines which are stronger today than they were a year ago. And while the near-term impact may be less predictable, we believe longer term impact of the enactment of federal tax reform is positive for our customers, our region and for Huntington. We expect positive economic impact from the manufacturing and business expansion to our footprint from increased capital expenditures across wide array of industries and businesses from the reduced corporate tax burdens, as well as the impact of repatriation of foreign earnings by a number of corporations. And in addition, it\u2019s important to remember that our commercial focus is primarily on privately held businesses. These businesses stereotypically are more likely to pay a full statutory tax rate and therefore are going to see materially improved profitability and cash flow. And importantly, these companies are also likely to reinvest those tax benefits into their businesses to fund growth. Moving to slide 18. Huntington\u2019s strong positioned to deliver consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing volatility of results and returns, achieving top tiered performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. I would like to highlight the graph in the top left quadrant, which represents our continued growth in pretax pre-provision net revenue as a result of the focused execution of our core strategies, plus the economics of FirstMerit. This strong level of capital generation position us well to fund organic growth and to return capital to our shareholders, consistent with our previously communicated capital priorities. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 19 to review our 2018 expectations. As we look forward to 2018, we expect a full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 6% inclusive of over $500 million auto loan securitization in the back half of the year. Full year average deposit growth is expected to be 3% to 5%. We continue to budget expecting no change in interest rates as we have for the last few years. While it appears likely as that the fed might said act again this year, it has served us well to take a more of conservative approach in our budgeting process and plan accordingly. And we continue to do so with respect to our plans and budget for this year. We expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 6%; we\u2019re projecting the GAAP NIM to be flat and the core NIM to be up modestly in 2018, under those assumptions. On the expense side, we\u2019re expecting a 2% to 4% decrease from the 2017 GAAP noninterest expense of $2.7 billion. Our expectations include improvement in the cash efficiency ratio to a range of 55% to 57% towards the positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We anticipate net charge-offs will remains below our long-term goal of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. And we expect the effective tax rate to be in the 16% to 17% range, fully reflective of federal tax reform. So, let\u2019s turn to slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages, please. We had very good fourth quarter, including record net income for the third consecutive quarter. The core franchise continues to perform well on many fronts, but we believe we can further improve our core performance. We\u2019re optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our footprint. As Mac noted, the FirstMerit acquisition accelerated our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals. And we delivered on those goals for the first time on a GAAP bases in the fourth quarter. We expect to achieve them on a full year GAAP basis in 2018, two years sooner than we planned when we originally announced the revised goals in December of 2014. We are fully realizing the $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition, as originally communicated. We also continue to execute on the significant revenue enhancement opportunities, delivering $48 million in 2017 through OCR, small business, home lending and RV and marine lending initiatives. As I look back on our announcement of the FirstMerit acquisition two years ago, we delivered on our promises, our promises to improve the efficiency ratio by greater than 400 basis points, our promise to improve return on assets by 15 basis points and our promise to improve return on tangible common equity by more than 300 basis points. In fact, versus the 2015 fourth quarter, right before we announced the deal, our efficiency ratio improved by 880 basis points and our core ROTC improved by more than 360 basis points to 16%. So, today, our teams are fully integrated, they\u2019re focused, and they\u2019re performing well. And we expect them to continue to perform at an even higher level. We\u2019re optimistic about 2018 and into the year -- coming into the year with business line momentum. We remain focused on delivering consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over time and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout.  So, I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get your questions. Thank you. Mark Muth : Melissa, we will now take questions. We ask that as the courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person have additional question, he or she can add himself back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ricky Dodds : Hey, guys. It\u2019s actually Ricky for Matt\u2019s team. Just wondering if you could quickly touch on your fee expectations for the year, I know you gave some of the revenue outlooks. But I was wondering if you could maybe touch on that. And then, maybe specifically talk about some of strengths you\u2019ve had in the capital markets business over the past few quarters. I think you had a nice step up there. So, maybe if you can talk about that is well. Thanks. Steve Steinour : So, we are seeing, I think a good strength in the fee businesses. I think you need to keep in mind some of the investments that we made around the FirstMerit acquisition and SBA lending and mortgage banking in particular, I think those investments are paying off for us very well. I would say, we\u2019re ahead of SBA. And I think we\u2019re catching up on mortgage. We might have been a little bit behind in terms of hiring in some markets, but I think we\u2019re in good shape as we enter 2018. So, I would expect to see good growth in those lines. Capital markets is a real opportunity for us. They had a record quarter in the fourth quarter in terms of revenue. And when we think about the opportunities to sell into the FirstMerit customer base, we have capital markets with treasury management, our products on the Huntington side much stronger, our expertise from a sales perspective, I think is much better. And we\u2019re seeing real opportunities there as we think about penetrating that customer base. It all ties into our optimal customer relationship strategy which we continue to focus on across the entire organization. While we believe the opportunities are higher for FirstMerit side, we definitely have opportunities on the Huntington side as well. So, I would say that 2018 is going to be a good year for fee income growth relative to what we\u2019ve seen historically because of those investments and because of our focus on OCR. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Sam Ross : Good morning, this is actually Sam Ross on for John Pancari. I know you guys talked about your loans picking up at the end of the quarter. I\u2019m just hoping you can maybe talk about where your line utilization rate ended the quarter and may be sort of what you are seeing at your line utilization currently? Dan Neumeyer : Yes. This is Dan. Actually line utilization was down just a tick. I think we were down two-tenths of a percent in the quarter. The dynamics kind of changed throughout the course of the quarter where we had a lot of year-end activity, very much close to the year end. I think there was a lot of built-up demand that had been delayed throughout the year. And so, we have seen an uptick there. I would expect that in the first quarter utilization is difficult to pinpoint and with the benefits of tax reform, you don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be an immediate impact or whether you might see it later on. I think as the year goes on, I would expect we will see an uptick in utilization but really hard to estimate in the first quarter. Sam Ross : Got it. And then, maybe just a following cleanup question. I know you guys gave your NIM expectation for full year 2018. But given the impacts of tax reform, what are you guys seeing from your NIM expectations for Q1? Mac McCullough : So, I think the one impact you need to think about is just the impact of FTEs; it\u2019s about a 3 basis-point reduction in the NIM related to normalizing for the tax reform on the FTE adjustment. But other than that, I wouldn\u2019t expect material change. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Steve, I was hoping if you could spend maybe just a moment or two offering a little bit your thoughts on kind of reinvestment of the tax benefits if any, or basically how you look at the balance of allowing it to flow through the bottom-line versus just ongoing or increased investments? Steve Steinour : Scott, we\u2019ve been working with a long-term set of strategies now for almost a decade and that informs our plans every year, it certainly has in 2018. And as I mentioned, we try to approach it conservatively in terms of assuming no interest rate changes. And we\u2019ve been investing every year in the businesses since 2010. We will continue to do that. So, the tax reform does not change our plans in any meaningful way and we\u2019re set with those. So, we would expect the benefits of the tax reforms to flow very, very substantially to the bottom-line. If some of it tends to get competed away over time, we think we are in a tremendous position to respond with the relatively strong performance in both returns and NIM. So, expecting for 2018 that very substantially it goes to the bottom-line and we\u2019ll see how the market reacts over time. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then, Mac, I was just hoping to ask just a quick question on the potential conversion of the Series A preferred. So, if I understand it correctly, you could potentially force conversion as soon as next month, if the right circumstances occur. Would you guys have to resubmit CCAR if you wanted to do it this year or is it something that for all intents and purposes maybe it\u2019s just any conversion would be part of the next CCAR process period regardless of the whether or not you can force based on stock price movements? Mac McCullough : Yes, Scott. So, we wouldn\u2019t seem to resubmit our 2017 CCAR in order to force the conversion. In terms of thinking through how we might optimize capital going forward and the opportunities that that creates, that would be a part of the 2018 process. Scott Siefers : Okay I understand. So, you do have plenty of flexibility should you choose to -- in very short order potentially. Steve Steinour : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Follow-up on that capital structure question, Mac. So, just trying to understand the ins and out. So, currently, we got the share count in and I think your point about flat as if we were to then leave those shares in and take out this preferred that would be neutral. But would that also consider the line on 13 about additional potential to new preferred issuance? Mac McCullough : Yes. Ken, so, the way to think about it, so, we\u2019re paying 8.5% on the Pref A that has the potential to convert here in the first quarter. And it basically is neutral to EPS as we bring those shares back in because of the yield that we\u2019re paying on that pref. So, what that does for us when we think about 2018 CCAR process, obviously this is going to increase our TCE and our CET1 ratios, again with no impact to EPS. And it will give us the opportunity to optimize capital in the 2018 CCAR process at -- even if we issue additional preferred to offset the preferred that we\u2019re converting, it is likely going to be neutral to EPS because of high rate that we\u2019re paying on the current pref versus where we\u2019re currently in the market for a similar instrument, and then, thinking about how we use the common equity that\u2019s been created in the 2018 CCAR process. So, I think in terms of where we sit today, it\u2019s neutral or positive. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay, got it. So, we should think about both the potential preferred but also the potential that you could do more on the equity side and CCAR also. So it\u2019s more than just -- okay, I got it. Second question just then, the credit outlook continues to be very good, taking all of Steve\u2019s points about the strength across the footprint. It did have a bit of that continued provision step up which I would still assume was mostly related to the legacy portfolio. So, can you help us just understand that push and pull about that provision movement on the old book and then just how you expect underlying credit? I know below the 35 to 50 but it\u2019s been for such a long time. So, just kind differentiate the provision for the legacy book and then also just how you think about the core. Dan Neumeyer : Sure, Ken. This is Dan. So, provision in the quarter, there were three primary drivers, one is just loan growth. We did have a good period-end loan growth, despite the fact that average balances weren\u2019t really up. We did have a surge at quarter-end and that\u2019s on the basis on which reserves are based. So, the second component would be that we had a couple of credits with some specific reserves, nothing huge but nonetheless a driver there. And then, third were the FirstMerit renewals. And as you know, these are loans that were marked, had no reserves established. But when we extend the restructure, they now have a reserve attached to them. So it\u2019s those three components that make up what happened in the quarter. I would point out that when you look at that year as a whole because clearly this is a dynamic process, there is going to be fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But, on average, we had about $50 million of provision expense for quarter and about $40 million per quarter of charge-off. So, we said that we would slowly, very slowly build the reserve. I think if you looked a year ago, we were at 1.10 coverage on an ACL basis and we ended the year at 1.11. So, I think that qualifies as a slow build. So, that\u2019s really the dynamics going on there. Ken Usdin : And that\u2019s what you continue? Dan Neumeyer : Yes. The impact on FirstMerit is that book continues to mature and more and more is slipped to Huntington origination. The impact there is going to lessen and lessen as the years go by. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter Winter : I was just -- I know your outlook assumes no rate hikes. I\u2019m just curious what would be the impact to net interest income and net interest margin with the 25 basis-point rate hike? Mac McCullough : Yes. Peter, it\u2019s Mac. So, if you think about 25 basis points short end for the full year, it\u2019s probably in the neighborhood of $25 million pick-up for the full year, is the way to think about it. Peter Winter : I\u2019m sorry and that\u2019s assuming two rate hikes? Mac McCullough : Well, that would be the impact of 25 basis points. So, if it\u2019s two rate hikes, it will be twice that. Peter Winter : Got it. And then, secondly, you talked about your selectively increasing certain deposit costs. Could you just give us a little bit more color how much you increased the deposit cost and what the impact would be in the first quarter? Mac McCullough : So, we\u2019re just looking I think more closely at -- on the commercial side, the relationships and the depth of the relationships when we think about how we pass through any additional price increases. As you know, we\u2019re a relationship bank and we deeply value those deep relationships with our customers. And that\u2019s exactly the way we\u2019re thinking about it. I think, we\u2019ve pretty much worked our way through the most recently hike. There still might be a few additional opportunities that we\u2019re considering. But, we\u2019re very focused on the commercial side in terms of making sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing from a rate increase perspective with our deep customer relationships. Peter Winter : Okay. Thank you. Mac McCullough : And Peter, if I could just go back to your first question, what I gave you was the full year impact of 25 basis points. So, you need to decide the timing and kind of factor in how that would impact full year 2018. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed with your question. Marty Mosby : Steve, I want to ask you about the goals, the five goals that you talked about going into 2018. I wasn\u2019t sure, I thought for while there, I was getting it right, but I just want to make sure that without the impact from taxes, you\u2019re saying that you would have accomplished those in the fourth quarter of this year or you would accomplish those in 2018 or do you need tax benefit to even get it in 2018? Mac McCullough : No, Marty, to clarify then, we accomplished those in the fourth quarter excluding tax benefit. And we would have expected to accomplish them in 2018 excluding tax benefit. They will only be further embellished if you will, with tax benefit. Marty Mosby : Okay. That\u2019s what I thought we were getting at and then I kind of got confused there for a second. Mac, on the provision, I want to go back to that, kind of walk forward, but I think that\u2019s where some of this can get a little bit in a sense just convoluted in the way that you got -- in the slide that you showed the reduction of the purchase accounting accretion, you also show a reduction in provision of $50 million. So, if we look at your provision for this year at $200 million roughly, and so, when we are itemizing net interest income and saying basically margins flat on a GAAP basis, so we kind of take that as a guidance. The next thing to do, we take that all else being the same, the charge-offs, you would end up with $50 million or less. So, you would have a walk down of provision from $200 million to a $150 million in that kind of cocoon of assumptions and guidance. So, I just want to make sure that was kind of the way to look at that. Mac McCullough : Yes, Marty. That is correct. I mean, the year-over-year impact is about $51 million reduction in provision related to FirstMerit, simply because we have less loans moving from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio. Marty Mosby : That\u2019s what I thought. And I think that\u2019s where you can probably get some layering effect that I was wondering why other estimates weren\u2019t kind of catching up to where we were. But, I think that was the missing piece if people kind of start looking at the models and sort of thinking okay well, the NII is pretty clear but the next guidance is you really got to pull down that extra build in allowance of $50 million that then helps lower your provisioning as you go into 2018. So, thanks. I appreciate that clarity. Mac McCullough : Marty, as we think about 2018 and how Dan kind of described the provision on the reserve build, I mean obviously it\u2019s going to depend on the environment; it\u2019s going to depend on the strength of loan growth in 2018. And we do expect that we\u2019re going to be working into a gradual build of the reserve going forward. So, I would tell you that a lot factors go into that. I think, we saw probably better performance in 2017 than we expected on both the Huntington and the FirstMerit side of the equation. So, things are shaping up well as we think about 2018. But, I do think longer term we have a graphical reserve build. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Barker : Thank you. Your guidance assumes that we\u2019re going to see core operating expenses go up by roughly 1% with GAAP expenses going down about 2% to 4%. With that core EPS -- core operating expense growing at 1%, do you expect that to be a two to three-year run rate on growth for operating expenses, given some of the fall-through from the FirstMerit transaction and any other big investments you have out there? Mac McCullough : Yes, Kevin. It\u2019s Mac. So, clearly, we\u2019re getting full year benefit of the cost takeouts from FirstMerit in 2018. So that\u2019s the way I would think about the 1% that you quote in 2018. I would not expect that to be longer term growth rate going forward. We continue to invest in the business. As you know personnel costs are the biggest component of our expense line up, and we continue to give merit increases and those types of things. So, when we modeled FirstMerit, we kind of assumed the 3% core growth rate and expense going forward. And I will just point out that we\u2019ve achieved the cost takeouts, we\u2019ve achieved the metrics that we expected from efficiency and ROTCE and we continue to get benefit in the expense growth rate in 2018. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then, you\u2019ve made that reinvestment of roughly, was it $100 million, generate additional revenue. Do you see any other large investments that need to be made on the horizon following as you\u2019ve digested FirstMerit fully? Mac McCullough : Just to go back, the investment we made in the FirstMerit revenue initiatives is $50 million. So, we expect $100 million in incremental revenue and then $50 million would be the assumption we made assuming the 50% efficiency ratio; and going back to the $100 million in revenue that was the number that we expected at a minimum. And we do believe that we\u2019re going to see additional revenue opportunities coming out of the FirstMerit transaction as these initiatives mature and in particular as we execute on OCR which actually is the biggest opportunity of all the revenue initiatives coming out of FirstMerit. As Steve pointed out, we make investments in the business based upon what we need to do based upon what\u2019s happening in the environment and what we feel we need to do from a colleague perspective, from a customer prospective. And I think we\u2019ve done a really good job of that over time. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage going forward. And as Steve mentioned also, we\u2019re just kicking off our strategic planning process; we\u2019re evaluating different opportunities to grow the business. The primary focus of that process is on revenue growth and thinking about the customer and thinking about what we can do to improve customer experience. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Reevey : So, this question is for Steve or Mac. So, your revenue outlook for 2018 is 4% to 6%, which is similar to your revenue outlook for last year. And I\u2019m just curious why you not have higher -- stronger outlook, given the fact now that we have corporate tax reform? And it seems like there is a lot more optimism today than there was last year. Mac McCullough : Kevin, it\u2019s Mac. The 4% to 6% range we think is reasonable, given our risk appetite and how we think about what we want to put on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously, it wasn\u2019t until late in the year that we knew the tax reform was going to get passed. And we still don\u2019t know exactly how to think about it in 2018, although we did see a strong close to 2017 in terms of loan growth on the commercial side in particular. So, we definitely have the opportunities around the FirstMerit investments. And we think we\u2019re going to perform better on those than what we expected. Offsetting that we got some headwinds around first accounting accretion that we\u2019ve just talked about and we\u2019re still in a 2% to 3% GDP growth economy. So, I think 4% to 6% is the right range for us, in particular as we think about managing risk appropriately in terms of what we put on the balance sheet. Kevin Reevey : And then, just to follow up on the FirstMerit Synergies. How should we think about how the $100 million of synergies are spread out in 2018? Do you think that\u2019s going to come more -- is that going to be more back half loaded or should we -- was that more evenly spread out? Mac McCullough : Kevin, there will be some seasonality to certain of those products, mortgage and RV marine. But, by the second quarter, those should be performing well. So, short seasonality first quarter and then, remember, we\u2019ve said a $100 million plus in the revenue side. And so, we kind of lock into this $100 million, but we had a very good year. We put a lot of the base line expense in, coming back to the earlier question $48 million of revenue, $37 million of expense. And so now, we get the operating leverage of goes initiatives as we move forward. And obviously, we\u2019re pretty bullish about on how the integration of FirstMerit has been achieved. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question. Terry McEvoy : A question maybe for Dan. I\u2019m just looking for your comments on some fourth quarter trends and the outlook as it relates to the C&I and CRE loans with retail exposure. Dan Neumeyer : Sure. So, I think over time, one, we feel very good about -- on the C&I side, as we pointed out, our exposures are very well diversified; we didn\u2019t have any exposures to those entities filing for bankruptcy et cetera. Many of our exposures are in auto part, supply investment grade et cetera. So, feel really good there. With the CRE, a little more challenging, because obviously with every announcement of a new bankruptcy that\u2019s going to impact some of our properties. Now, up until this point, we\u2019re seeing a very slow migration of credits into criticized status because of some of these bankruptcies. We\u2019ve also seen some challenges in terms of delayed projects. Frankly, there is labor shortages in some areas that are causing projects to fall behind. So, we\u2019ve seen some very modest deterioration there. But again, due to the diversification of our portfolio, the strength of our core developers et cetera, we feel really good about where we\u2019re sitting today. Terry McEvoy : Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, when I look at the revenue synergies, Chicago comes up a couple of times. And, when I look at Huntington, most of your major markets, your top five, Ohio, Detroit, Indianapolis; whereas in Chicago you\u2019re closer to 20. And I guess my question is do you have the scale that\u2019s necessary to accomplish and generate the revenue synergies that we\u2019ve been talking about on the call specific to that market? Steve Steinour : Well, remember -- this is Steve. The revenue synergies are across the board, but in Chicago, we have very select focus on our different business initiatives there. We\u2019re not trying to play a broad-based consumer strategy, for example, given the limited distribution. So, we feel -- we definitely feel very good about what we\u2019re accomplishing in Chicago. We have a great team there, set of teams there, and are bullish about our ability to get to a $100 million plus on these FirstMerit synergies this year and obviously expect to keep going. We like the niches we have in Chicago, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re playing. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Steve Steinour : Any questions, operator? Operator : We have one question from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Steve, you may not like this question but I will ask it anyway. Just following up on Terry\u2019s question a little bit, just strategic thinking, big picture thinking for the Company. With FirstMerit, obviously, you guys have had ups and down but it\u2019s now really coming through and you\u2019ve proved that you can do an acquisition and integrate it, get the expenses and get the revenues. What is the Steve Steinour and Board big picture thinking on M&A? Willing to do it again? Steve Steinour : Jon, we always look at things but the priority for us in 2018 is getting the strategic plan process really robustly and well completed; and then, secondarily, making sure we deliver these revenue metrics. We have been saying for several years we think we\u2019re in late innings of the game; it looks like it just had extended into extra innings. But we\u2019re in a cautious pasture. Dan referenced that in terms of some of the things that we were doing earlier and in prior calls around limits on construction, commercial real estate, host of things. We will continue those. We will look for other areas where we think we need to adjust, and during the good times with the view that we will have lower volatility through cycles and continue. So, as we advance the strategic plan, the emphasis is on core, not M&A and that\u2019s our focus. Jon Arfstrom : Fair enough. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Jon. So I think we have to wrap up here, we\u2019re coming into the home stretch. Thank you very much for joining the call. As you can see, we produced very results in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2017. And you can tell, we are confident as we come into 2018 that we have momentum in our businesses. Strategies are working. We expect to drive positive results for 2018. We believe we are going to continue to gain market share and grow share of wallet. Our top priorities are growing our core businesses and continuing to realize the revenue synergies from FirstMerit which are not capped at $100 million. So, we\u2019ve always said a 100 million plus. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the core economic benefits of the acquisition of FirstMerit. We have achieved all of our long-term financial goals and there is more opportunity at hand in 2018 and beyond. So, finally, I would like to include a reminder that there\u2019s just a unique and high level alignment between the Board and management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and colleagues are collectively one of the largest shareholders in Huntington. We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares which is very unique. We will continue to proactively manage risk and volatility. And we are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. So, I appreciate again your interest in Huntington. Thanks for joining us today, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Mark Muth : Thank you, Melissa. Welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.huntington.com.

Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to the slides and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Now I\u2019m turning it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark. And thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a solid first quarter and entered 2018 with momentum. We reported net income of $326 million and earnings per share of $0.28, up 65% from the year ago quarter. Return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17.5%. Average loans increased 9% annualized versus the fourth quarter 2017, driven by disciplined broad-based growth in both commercial and consumer loans. We\u2019re pleased with our first quarter efficiency ratio of 57%, driven by 3% year-over-year revenue growth and expense discipline. The franchise continues to perform well on many fronts as a result of focused execution and the realized economics of the FirstMerit deal. As previously outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile trough the cycle shareholder returns. We prudently allocate our capital to ensure we\u2019re earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risk. We also continued to make meaningful long-term investments in our businesses, particularly around customer experience to drive organic growth. We\u2019re very pleased with how we're positioned with the sustainable competitive advantages we've created. And Slide 4 illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were approved by the Board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five year time horizon in mind and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on both a reported GAAP basis and an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Now our first quarter efficiency ratio was near the low end of our long-term goal as a result of the successful integration of FirstMerit, our expense discipline and focus on revenue growth. Charge-offs remain below our long term expectation. Our 17.5% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top performing regional bank. And these peer leading results demonstrate that our strategies are working and will continue to drive Huntington forward. We're pleased with our first quarter performance against all of these metrics. Also, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to remind you of the considerable improvement in our financial performance since 2014 when we introduced these goals. So in the first quarter of 2014, our return on tangible common was 11.3% and our efficiency ratio was 66.4%. So through our disciplined execution over the years, we\u2019ve elevated Huntington from the middle of the peer group to peer leading financial performance, driving a greater than 600 basis point improvement in ROTCE and almost 1,000 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio alone. Let's now turn to Slide 5 to review 2018 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. We remain optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states footprint. And as we've noted previously, our footprint has outperformed rest of the nation during the economic recovery that began in mid-2009. Unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint remain near historical lows. The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong with several markets such as Columbus, Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see meaningful labor shortages given metro unemployment rates, which are well below national averages. Philadelphia Fed\u2019s state leading indicator indices for our footprint point toward a favorable economic operating environment in 2018, most of the states are expected to see an acceleration in economic activity over the next six months. Four of our states, including Ohio, are expected to grow significantly faster than the nation as a whole. As a result of federal tax reform, we expect continued business investment and expansion. We are seeing an increased capital expenditure. It's important to remember that our commercial focus is primarily privately held businesses and these companies are likely to reinvest tax benefits into their businesses to fund growth. As in aside Site Selection Magazine\u2019s Governor\u2019s Cup for Capital Investments and New Jobs created in 2017 support our expectations, five of the eight states placed -- five of our eight states placed in the top 10 of the nations for total qualified new projects with Ohio earning the number two spot overall. These rankings and leading indicators confirm our optimism. But importantly, our loan pipelines remain solid across all footprints. And as we get out and as I talk to different business owners, and I can confirm this is a wide spread level of optimism. In fact, if anything we\u2019re being held back by labor supply shortages. We\u2019re clearly seeing impacts in construction and other businesses where they just can't get enough labor. And as a consequence, we\u2019re starting to see labor inflation, but we\u2019re also seeing businesses now that are working on next year's pipelines of activity. So backlogs are looking good in many of our businesses, manufacturing, construction are two examples. And we\u2019re feeling very good on the whole about this year and stress going into next. And so while the growth trends will likely not be linear, we remain optimistic with our full year outlook. We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 6% inclusive of $500 million auto loan securitization in the back half of the year. Full year average deposit growth is expected to be 3% to 5%, and you know for internal forecasts and the guidance purposes. We continue to assume no additional interest rate changes consistent with our approach over the last few years. And while it appears likely that the fed might act again this year, it served us well to take a more conservative approach in our forecasting process. We expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 6%. We are projecting the GAAP NIM for the full year to be flat and the core NIM to be up modestly in 2018. On the expense side, we are expecting a 2% to 4% decrease from the 2017 GAAP non-interest expense of $2.7 billion. Our expectations include improvement in the efficiency ratio to a range of 55% to 57%, as well as we are targeting positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We anticipate net charge-offs will remain below our long-term goal 35 to 55 basis points. And importantly, we\u2019ve lowered our expectation for the effective tax rate to the 15.5% to 16.5% range. The range is fully reflective of federal tax reform. Now looking beyond 2018. We recently began a new three-year strategic planning process. Our pass-through strategic plan significantly advance the Company's financial performance and competitive positioning. To continue this momentum, our initial areas of focus for the 2018 strategic planning process, are number one; top line revenue growth; two, capital optimization; and three, business model evolution incorporating expected disruption. As we stated previously, an important outcome of the strategic planning process will be new long-term financial goals for the Company, and we expect to be in a position to communicate those later in the year. So with that, let me now turn it over to Mac for an overview of the financials. Mac? Mac McCullough : Thanks Steve. Slide 6 provides the highlights of the first quarter. As Steve mentioned, we had a good first quarter, but also a clean quarter as there were no significant items. We reported earnings per common share of $0.28 for the first quarter, up 65% over the year ago quarter. The year ago quarter included $0.04 per share reduction due to significant items related to the FirstMerit integration. Return on assets was 1.27%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17.5%. We believe all three of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.8%. Tangible book value per share increased 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we repurchased $48 million of common stock, representing 3 million shares at an average cost of $15.83 per share. This completed the $308 million buyback authorization under a 2017 CCAR plan. Turning to Slide 7. Total revenue was up 3% from the year ago quarter. Net interest income was up 5% year-over-year due to a 5% increase in average earning assets while the net interest margin was unchanged. Non-interest income increased 1% year-over-year with increases in capital market fees, card and payment processing revenue and trust and investment management fees, partially offset by lower mortgage banking income and a reduction in gains on the sale of loans, primarily related to the sale of an equipment finance loan in the year ago quarter. While both mortgage and SBA originations were higher year-over-year, compression in secondary market spreads in mortgage banking and the timing of SBA loans sales resulted in year-over-year declines in these fee categories. FirstMerit related revenue enhancement opportunities remain on track to deliver over $100 million of revenue in 2018 with an efficiency ratio below 50%. As we stated before, these projections are included in our 2018 guidance. Non-interest expense decreased 10% year-over-year due entirely to $73 million of significant items expensed in year ago quarter related to the integration of FirstMerit versus no significant items expensed in the current quarter. Expenses were flat versus prior quarter. It should be noted that expenses are historically higher in the second quarter, primarily driven by the timing of compensation associated with long-term incentives and seasonally higher marketing expense, which combined could add up to $20 million compared to the first quarter. However, these are just timing differences, and as Steve mentioned earlier, we remain comfortable with full year guidance, including full year expectations for non-interest expense per analyst estimate. For a closer look at the income statement details, please refer to the analyst pack and press release. Turning to Slide 8. Average earning assets grew 5% from the first quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by 5% increase in average loans and leases and 3% increase in average securities. The increase in average securities primarily reflected an increase in direct purchase instruments in our commercial banking segment. Average C&I loans increased 1% year-over-year with growth centered in middle market banking. On a linked quarter basis, average C&I loans increased 3% or 12% annualized with broad-based growth in specialty, corporate and middle market banking. Average commercial real estate loans were flat year-over-year as we have conservatively tightened CRE lending, specifically in multi-family, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Average auto loans increased 9% year-over-year as a result of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2018, up 1% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.86% in the first quarter, up from 3.52% in the prior quarter. Average RV and marine loans increased 32% year-over-year, reflecting the success of our expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two year. Average residential mortgage loans increased 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong demand for mortgages across our footprint, as well as the benefit of our ongoing investment in former FirstMerit geographies, particularly Chicago. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Turning attention to the chart on the right side of slide. Average total deposits increased 1% from the year-ago quarter, including 3% increase in average core deposits. In the first quarter, we began to see customer migration into higher yielding deposit products such as CDs and money market accounts. Moving to Slide 9. Our net interest margin was 3.30% for the first quarter, unchanged from both year ago and linked quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 8 basis points to the net interest margin in the first quarter, down from 10 basis points in the prior quarter and 16 basis points in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for purchase accounting accretion in all quarters, the core NIM was 322 compared to 320 in the prior quarter and 314 in the first quarter of 2017. Growth in core NIM over the past year has more than offset the benefit in purchase accounting accretion. Slide 29 in the appendix provides information regarding the scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2018 and 2019. Our deposit cost remained well contained as consumer core deposits were up 5 basis points year-over-year and commercial core deposits were up 18 basis points. With the market outlook for continued rate hikes and increasing deposit competition, we locked in fixed-rate term deposits and selectively increased rates to grow and retain core relationships, providing better economics for the bank relative to the cost of wholesale funding. On the earnings asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 36 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 11 basis points. On a linked quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 14 basis points while consumer loan yields increased 3 basis points. Moving to Slide 10. Our cycle to-date deposit beta remains low at 17% through the first quarter of 2018, and roughly in line with the average of our peers that have reported so far. As we told you last quarter, we are seeing increased deposit competition as competitors conduct various product and pricing tests across our footprint. As a result, we anticipate a continued increase in deposit betas this year, driven by both mix and cost. Assuming two additional rate increases in 2018, our current forecast assumes the deposit beta of approximately 50% for calendar year 2018 with a higher proportion of incremental deposit growth coming in from higher cost of products, including money markets and CDs. Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. During the first quarter, we converted 363 million of high cost Series A preferred equity into common shares, and subsequently issued 500 million of attractively priced Series E preferred equity, improving our capital ratios. Note that the first quarter preferred dividend expense that that include any dividend on the new Series E due to the issuance timing. Therefore, the total second quarter preferred dividend expense will be approximately $21 million or $3 million higher than the future quarterly run rate of approximately $18 million to account for the partial quarters Series E dividend. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.70%, up 42 basis points year-over-year. Common equity Tier 1 or CET 1 ended the quarter at 10.49% or 75 basis points year-over-year and above our 9% to 10% operating guideline. We believe our earnings power capital generation and risk management discipline will support a higher dividend payout ratio over time. As we have previously stated, our capital priorities are first organic growth, second support the dividend, and third everything else, including buybacks. With respect to this year\u2019s CCAR, we have a unique opportunity as a result of the two preferred transactions, which pushed CET 1 above the high-end of our operating guideline of 9% to 10%. Moving to Slide 12. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles. And our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. We booked provision expense of $68 million in the first quarter compared to net charge-offs of $38 million. The level of provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong commercial loan originations, as well as continued migration of the acquired FirstMerit portfolio into the originated portfolio. Net charge-offs represent an annualized 21 basis points of average loans and leases, which remain below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down 3 basis points from the prior quarter and the year ago quarter. CRE had net recoveries again this quarter, driven by one large relationship. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans increased 2 basis points linked-quarter to 1.01%, and coverage of non-accrual loans was 188%. Turning to Slide 13. Non-performing assets increased $31 million or 8% linked-quarter. The NPA ratio increased 4 basis points sequentially to 59 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased 7 basis points from 3.53% to 3.60%. Our 90-day plus delinquencies declined 2 basis points. NPA inflows increased 6 basis points. Overall, asset quality metrics remain cyclical lows and some quarterly volatility is expected given the adequate low level of problem loans. Turning to Slide 14. We highlight Huntington\u2019s strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pretax, pre-provision net revenue as a result of the focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to fund organic growth and return capital to our shareholders, consistent with our capital priorities. The top right chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and commercial bank, and believe that the diversification of the balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. We were pleased with the 2017 DFAST and CCAR results, which provide an instant quarterly industry comparison. The results illustrate our strong enterprise risk management and our discipline to operate within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Our DFAST stress test results are highlighted in the bottom left. Finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington\u2019s strong capital position. As we return to the key messages on Slide 15, let me turn the presentation back over to Mark for Q&A. Mark Muth : We will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill and Partners. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : First question, Steve maybe for you, I just wanted to talk about the outlook that you guys have always been extraordinarily conservative on the rate outlook. It looks like it\u2019s going to come in more accommodative than is embedded in your outlook for no rate increases. So in a sense that difference end up becoming kind of found money. So I guess if we were to get another hike or two, what is at a top level the plan? If you allow that similarly to drop to the bottom line or do you think about maybe reinvesting accelerating some costs, may be being even more aggressive on taking deposit market share, et cetera. What would be your thinking at the top level? Steve Steinour : We budget, we plan for no rate increases, but we obviously run scenarios around it. Mac shared that with, Scott, on the call in terms of deposit betas. We do think this environment is one that\u2019s conducive to us growing organically in a meaningful way. Pleased with the first quarter and we closed with good pipelines as we come into the second quarter. So we would expect the organic growth to continue. And in that construct look to continue to grow both the deposit and lump side, we\u2019re very focused on the fee side of the quarter and what we can do prospectively on that front as well. We had good SBA activity, for example, but we ended up seeing a lot more of a construction nature than we\u2019ve had before. So it\u2019s a sign of capital investment. There is a belief that by operating in this more conservative fashion, we\u2019ll be a little more agile as we move forward with the benefit of rate increases. Anything you want to add, Mac? Mac McCullough : Scott the way to think about it is a 25 basis point increase in rates on an annual basis is about $25 million in margin on an annual basis. So that obviously says a lot of assumptions around what we're expecting from the deposit betas and competition in the marketplace. And of course the lapping yield curve has not been conducive to that either. So we\u2019re a little bit cautious as we move through this. We do think there will be opportunities from increasing rates, but at the same time, we\u2019ve never focused on growing core deposits. We had great core deposit growth year-over-year at about 3%, and we aim to continue to do that. Scott Siefers : And I guess what I was getting at it, let's say, you get that some portion of the $25 million, you just let that drop straight to the bottom line use that as an opportunity to maybe spend a little more than you would have anticipated? Just given the disconnect between how you\u2019re likely to pan out in terms of rate moves versus what you guys are forecasting in the guidance? Steve Steinour : Scott, we have significant investment built into the 2018 budget already. So clearly, we will be opportunistic as we think about what might happen from a rate increase perspective. And I would expect that majority of that would drop to the bottom line, but we\u2019ll selectively think to look at the investment opportunities on the digital front and in particular in customer experience and our colleagues. Scott Siefers : And then just maybe one follow-up. What was it that lapping you guys to improve the tax rate guide just a little bit. I mean I know it\u2019s not huge, but just curious your thoughts. Steve Steinour : What it really came down to Scott is we\u2019d like to give you ranges that are meaningful in terms of actually being able to achieve and fall within the range. And the fact of the matter is 17% would just be fine. So that\u2019s why we felt 15.5% to 16.5% was a better range for us to consider going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Sam Ross : This is actually Sam Ross on for John this morning. I just had a question about the ROTC guidance. I appreciate the fact you guys are currently reviewing your three year plan. I am just wondering given the fact where your 1Q ROTC came in. What do you guys thinking is an appropriate level for 2018 for you guys to operate in? Mac McCullough : So I would expect to be in that range. I mean, we\u2019re in the process of going through the long-term strategic plan. We\u2019re going to come out later this year with our new expectations for all those metrics. It's really important to keep in mind that we're going to operate within an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite, and a 17.5% ROTCE with an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite is pretty good in our estimation. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that you're going to see significant change within that goal going forward, but we\u2019ll go through the strategic planning process and we\u2019ll let you know later this year. Sam Ross : And then just looking at the balance sheet. In terms of the non-interest bearing deposits, I know you guys touched up on it in your prepared remarks about a mix shift that you guys are seeing into more higher interest rate products. I am just wondering was there anything outside of seasonality, you can maybe provide a little bit more color on if the sizeable decline in non-interest bearing deposits, I think that would be helpful. Thanks. Mac McCullough : I think what\u2019s happening, Sam, as you're seeing our commercial customers in particular being much more sensitive in terms of what's happening in the rate environment. And we're seeing them move balances from non-interest bearing into interest bearing, which I think you would expect in this environment. So that would be an additional factor on top of seasonality. Sam Ross : And would you expect that dynamic to continue into 2018 or what do we think about in terms of that? Mac McCullough : At some point, they complete the movement that they want to make from one category to the other. Clearly, as rates continued to increase, we\u2019re going to have commercial customers ask for some sharing of rates. But I think the mix shift should probably slowdown as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Josh on for Ken. Average wholesale funding showed a large sequential increase this quarter. Do you think there's potential to remix these wholesale sources into deposits, and then how you\u2019re thinking about funding the loan growth going forward? Mac McCullough : So we are actively thinking about what we need to do from a deposit rate perspective to bring wholesale funding down, particularly the overnight category. When we think about what we do on the commercial customer deposit pricing, we think about what rate we would provide to them relative to cost of growth overnight funding or across wholesale funding. So I would expect that you\u2019re going to see that continue to come down over time, and it should be an opportunity for us as we think about just the trade off and the rate improvement when we move the commercial deposits. So I think if you take a look at in the period, in particular you\u2019ll see this already down significantly that\u2019d be in the overnight funding. And then going forward, we are focused on core deposit growth. Like I\u2019ve mentioned in my comments, we grew 3% in core deposits year-over-year, which I think is a pretty good showing relative to our peers in the industry. We've had a lot of success with CD products and we were looking at some money market opportunities as well. So I think core deposit funding will be the primary way we\u2019re going to fund going forward. Unidentified Analyst : And we've heard from some of your peers that they\u2019re seeing a pretty benefit from the rollover of their swap portfolios. Could you just speak to what you're seeing in regards to this? Mac McCullough : So at this point, all of our asset swaps are off at this point. We have no assets swaps on. The last asset swap rolled out in the first quarter. We evaluate some of the debt swaps we have inside the time, and that represent an opportunity for us, but have not taken any action there as of yet. Josh does that answers your question. Unidentified Analyst : I was actually referring more to the rolling over the spreads, so better new money spreads versus what's rolling off as that liability side swap portfolio rolls. Mac McCullough : Clearly, we probably do have opportunities there. I don\u2019t think it would be large in the scheme of things for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos : I want to start first on the loan growth. You guys have really solid C&I loan growth in the quarter. And Steve, you\u2019re very optimistic in regard to business confidence, the economic strength of the footprint. As you look at the pipeline, could the high single digit growth you put up this quarter on average loans continue in the second quarter or is that really just an anomaly the way you look at it? Steve Steinour : The pipeline that we came into the year with was very strong. We had a surge in activity late in the year. So first quarter was very, very good with the carryover pipeline. As we come into the second quarter, we also have a sound pipeline across all the segments all of our businesses. And so there is an underlying sense of economic activity that we\u2019re able to participate in through our customers that we would expect to carry forward with the year. We clearly are seeing more CapEx related investments than we have in quite a few years at this stage Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : So is that why the average was so strong in the quarter as your customers spending, I mean the line utilization increase in the quarter? Dan Neumeyer : Our line utilization was off just a tick, so that really didn't benefit all that much. I do think we\u2019ve seen more of an evening out of where the growth is coming from. Core middle market has been good. I think we are not seeing the impact we saw last year in the large corporate space. I think we\u2019re actually seeing a bit of a pickup there and then some of the [indiscernible] as well. So it\u2019s good broad based contribution. And as Steve said, the pipeline remains fairly strong. Steven Alexopoulos : And then for my other question, I want to follow-up on the commentary around digital initiatives and what you\u2019re doing on the customer experience side. What the expected spend on technology this year and how does that compared to last year? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Steven, we don't disclose the spend on technology. I will say that it\u2019s up year-over-year in terms of what we're investing in technology development. And I would also tell you that the portion of that allocates to digital is up significantly year-over-year. Steven Alexopoulos : It is up significantly year-over-year, is that what you said? Mac McCullough : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Ricky Dodds : This is actually Ricky Dodds for Matt. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on or is there a build going forward. We\u2019ve seen a number of your peers have large reserve releases this quarter. Just wondering if you could provide some color for Huntington going forward, I know you have some FirstMerit renewals and you have stronger loan growth. But wondering if you just provide a little more color there? Steve Steinour : Well, in the quarter clearly with the loan growth that is going to come as additional reserve, so that's a large piece of it. The FirstMerit impact is still there although that\u2019s lessening each quarter. And then we did have some modest migration in the credit side and non-accrual loans that also contributed to the build. But as we\u2019ve said over time, we expect the level of provision to moderate with both loan growth and more normalizing credit performance. Although, we expect the net charge-offs to continue to be below our long term expectation. So as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s low build back up in the reserve but it will be modest and a slow ramp. Ricky Dodds : And then maybe just a follow-up on loan growth, it was particularly strong and you guys called out the core middle market. I was wondering if you could provide any specific colors on industries or geographies, and maybe outperforming our verticals, just wondering if you add any color there. Steve Steinour : Well, I think obviously in our heavy manufacturing market rates, in particular we're seeing strong demand there. But throughout our region, we have many areas that are involved in manufacturing. Chicago continues to be a strong growth market and that is far more diversified. I would say really most industries that we're looking at, I would say would have a positive outlook manufacturing wholesale, et cetera. And so really pretty good reads from all of our customers across most industries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed with your question. Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask, the only weakness really on the revenue side was in two categories, loan sale gains and mortgage banking. I was curious in a sense of -- I know you had some balance sheet optimization coming out of the merger. So I was trying to figure out was the $15 million to $18 million that and now we're back down to $8 million to $10 million of loan sale. And then is mortgage banking seasonal, have you seen any pick up or improvement in pricing as well as originations for the second quarter in that fee line item? Mac McCullough : So on the loan sale question, I would tell you that a lot of in this timing of SBA in the first quarter. So originations are actually up year-over-year. So good continued progress there, particularly as we move into Chicago and Wisconsin. So I view this as really a timing issue on the most part. In the first quarter of last year, we did have a large equipment sale that contributed at the first quarter. And those are lumpy, as you know, so that again is a timing issue. On the mortgage origination side, again volumes were up but favorable spreads are down. And a lot of the origination pickup has come from the FirstMerit expansion into Chicago and Wisconsin. And I would also tell you getting stronger in some of the core markets, primarily on the FirstMerit side. So we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing from origination perspective. But again, the sale of spread being down that\u2019s impacted the fee line. Marty Mosby : And then purchase accounting accretion is one of those things that is forced upon us, but has been having some impacts when you start looking at just how the market views your earnings. Now that we got a year to look back, you cut your first accounting accretion in half, but held your margin flat and actually grown net interest income. Do you feel like -- with the guidance, it seems like you\u2019re feeling very comfortable but as that headwind comes slows down that the balance sheet growth and then the core margin expansion would actually begin to really pick up some pace relative to whatever loss you might have in purchase account accretion? Steve Steinour : I am very pleased with what we are seeing in the core margin. We\u2019ve increased a few basis points per quarter since the first quarter of 2017, and we expect that to continue in 2018 as well. So right now, the guidance we\u2019re giving is flat to reported margin as we continue to burn off the purchase accounting accretion. Could it be a little bit better, it might be. It just depends on where deposit pricing goes and what it\u2019s going to take to fund the balance sheet. But very really pleased with how we come through the runoff in purchase accounting. And I think it really is disciplined pricing on both the asset and the liability side that\u2019s allowed us to do that. Marty Mosby : And then just the last thing, if you look at flat fed funds from here, but your core margin is still improving. Is that just like -- I think you highlighted the fact that the market rates are higher than the portfolio, both in securities and loans. So rounding up those yields just with stagnant rates where they\u2019re at right now is a very possible and reasonable outcome? Steve Steinour : Yes, I would agree with that. As we look at new money rates, they are generally higher than what\u2019s in the portfolio. We still have some purchase accounting impact that we\u2019re swimming through there. But again, we\u2019re very disciplined in how think about pricing, the asset side of the balance sheet. And even in a flat environment, we\u2019re going to continue to see new money come on at higher rates in the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter Winter : You guys talked about the seasonal increase in expense in the second quarter. I\u2019m just wondering would that be offset with a seasonal increase on the revenue side and so therefore, maybe the efficiency ratio should be at least steady in the second quarter? Mac McCullough : So typically, we do see a seasonal increase in revenue in the second quarter. The two are disconnected of course, because the increase in expense has primarily to do with just the timing long-term equity compensation, as well as seasonal marketing, which typically is higher in the second and third quarters and then declines in the fourth quarter. So based on that, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the efficiency ratio stayed in the same level, because we do see seasonality in revenue to the up side in the second quarter. Peter Winter : And then second separate question, it\u2019s minor but there was that uptick in non-performing assets. And I understand there\u2019s volatility at the bottom. But could you just give us a little bit of color on the increase in NPAs this quarter? Dan Neumeyer : So not industry driven, we have from time-to-time when you\u2019re down at very low levels of NPAs any couple of credits can move that we had three credits in the quarter in unrelated in industries. So no trends that we\u2019re overly concerned about. It was really idiosyncratic events, particularly to those three individual credits. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brock Vandervliet : I just want to circle back on the comment on deposit betas. It would seem like you may just be being conservative with 50% deposit beta that\u2019s clearly not visible in the numbers at the moment. Are you seeing -- is this caution on the commercial side? You noted the change in potential changing category that\u2019s driving some of that commentary. Mac McCullough : So the 50% reference would be to any rate increases in 2018. So that might be a little conservative as we think about it. But again, we\u2019re very focused on growing core deposits. If you take a look at across our region and who we compete with, we think it\u2019s very rational. We see what\u2019s happening and there is lots of testing from a pricing and product perspective. We\u2019re doing the same thing. But clearly, I think it\u2019s a good assumption for us to think about for 2018 just given the environment and the desire for us to continue to grow. Brock Vandervliet : And separately marine and RV. Clearly, growing very rapidly as that\u2019s been a new initiative for you. How large is that likely to become given that we are late in the cycle? Dan Neumeyer : Well, we do see growth opportunity out there. And we feel very comfortable because the quality of the borrowers that we\u2019re originating credit for is really in the super prime range. So I think given the fact that we\u2019ve expanded our markets, there is a big universe out there. The competition is not as robust as in say indirect auto. But we\u2019re originating at 90 plus FICOs for bid price both in RVs with folks with demonstrative liquidity, all these deals are individually underwritten. So we believe that there is potential out there for high quality assets. We have established a concentration limit so our growth will be moderated by that limit. But we have plenty of run way that we think will serve us well as we develop that business further. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstromwith RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Just following up on Brock\u2019s question, I hate to go back to deposit beta again. But basically, what you\u2019re saying is at this point you're performing just like everybody else in the mid-teens. But going forward from here, you expect the pressure to step up. That's all you\u2019re saying. Is that right? Mac McCullough : Jon, I think we\u2019re building that into the way we\u2019re thinking about the forecast. Again, we like to be conservative from a rate outlook perspective. We like to understand what\u2019s the revenue environment is going to be. And then from that determine what investments we want to make and how we manage the expense line. So it just keeps us from web selling but the business segments and the colleagues in terms of everyday out there doing their job. So I think that\u2019s exactly the way we stated that. Jon Arfstrom : Related question on the revenue growth guidance is the same at 4% to 6% as the prior quarter but we did get the March increase. It would get a couple more is the mac view of the world that the margin can drift higher? Mac McCullough : Yes, I think it can. I mean keep in mind that as I mentioned earlier, 25 basis point increase is worth $25 million in the full year basis. That\u2019s about 0.5% growth in revenue. So the 25 basis point increase in March wouldn\u2019t cause us to do anything to change our revenue guidance of 4% to 6%. But clearly in a rising rate environment, if we get the increases as might be expected, I would expect the margin to move higher. Jon Arfstrom : And then if I can just squeeze in one more. Steve, you made a comment on loan growth, you don't expect it to be linear. Just the nuance comment or is there any point you're trying to make on that? Steve Steinour : No, we just have a really strong first quarter. And while we are in the second quarter with good pipelines across all products just trying to be a bit cautious with -- in the context for the full year, the outlook and optimism we see that we\u2019ve communicated is abundant throughout the marketplace. So if anything there maybe a little upside. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Terry McEvoy : The consumer auto yields were down about 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and that\u2019s after trending higher throughout 2017. I believe you changed the credit scoring model early in last year. Were there any tweaks made to that model earlier in the first quarter and what are your thoughts on yields coming down? Steve Steinour : No tweaks and Terry, it\u2019s probably purchase accounting related. So we\u2019re seeing run-off from purchase accounting entries on that book and that\u2019s likely what\u2019s driving. Terry McEvoy : And then as a follow-up, maybe question for Dan. A few of your peer banks or national banks have scaled back expectations on CRE growth this year just based on, call it, market competition. What are your thoughts on incremental growth going forward after pretty solid growth here in the first quarter? Dan Neumeyer : I mean, the CRE can be a bit lumpy, because the various projects can move the needle. So we are continuing to support our core customers. But we've been pretty cautious in making sure that we have lessened our construction exposure recently, as we\u2019ve noted before been careful on multi-family and retail. But we\u2019re continuing to originate. We\u2019re still seeing good deal flow, and we are choosing those products or projects that are -- where we can get adequate structure and reasonable pricing. So we\u2019ll continue business as usual in the CRE space. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Steve Steinour for closing comments. Steve Steinour : So thank you very much. We feel very good about where we are. We obviously produce good results in the first quarter. And we're confident about our year, going forward. Our top priority is growing our core businesses and that's continuing. And we think there's more opportunity at hand, certainly throughout the year. We're building long-term shareholder value with top quartile financial performance, and we're maintaining strong risk management with disciplined execution across our strategies. So like the performance and position but feel we have upside opportunities to do better in a number of businesses. So finally, I'd like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. Collectively, the Board and colleagues are the seventh largest shareholder in Huntington and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained, and want to emphasize long-term performance. So thanks for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. And have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s [Call ended abruptly].",

Let me now turn it over to Steve. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a really solid second quarter as we continue to build momentum and deliver high-quality earnings. We reported net income of $355 million and earnings per share of $0.30, increases of 31% and 30%, respectively, over the second quarter of 2017. Profitability ratios were very good and improving with return on common equity of 13.2% and return on tangible common equity of 17.6%. The average loan increase was strong at 7% versus the second quarter of 2017 and 8% annualized versus the first quarter of 2018. Our loan growth was driven by disciplined broad-based growth in both commercial and consumer loans. We're pleased with our second quarter efficiency ratio of 57% driven by 4% year-over-year revenue growth and continued expense discipline. Our organic growth, along with the successful integration of the FirstMerit, provides scale which will allows for continued meaningful investments in extending our customer experience advantage through targeted investments in both people and technology, all while delivering positive operating leverage. The franchise continues to perform well on many fronts, allowing us to make the investments that we needed to compete at the highest levels of the industry as a result of the focused execution of our strategies. We're very pleased with the recent DFAST and CCAR stress test results which provided important industry comparisons. Now, Huntington's organic capital generation, as illustrated by the profitability metrics that I just referenced, is a significant competitive advantage for the company and is a direct result of our successful acquisition and integration of FirstMerit. On the credit side of the equation, our nine-quarter cumu loss as a percentage of total loans in a severely adverse scenario ranked third-lowest among traditional commercial banks. Our performance in the Fed's nine-quarter cumulative loan loss estimates in a severely adverse stress scenarios over the past four years, where we have never ranked lower than fourth, clearly reflects our relatively strong and consistently disciplined risk management. Combined, these results highlight our ability to generate strong earnings and industry-leading profitability. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite, which we put in place eight years ago. And as a reminder, we've reinforced the importance of these standards by requiring about the top 800 officers of the company to comply with Holt's retirement restrictions on their equity awards. I'd also like to take this opportunity to discuss the performance of the Auto Finance business in the stress test, particularly in light of the Fed's comments earlier this year stating that they intended to stress auto portfolios heavily. The Fed's black box remains opaque. However, we know that our other consumer portfolios' severely adverse stress scenario losses which includes the super prime indirect auto portfolio, we're among \u2013 we're the fifth best among the traditional commercial banks. Within the company-run portion of DFAST, our indirect auto portfolio remained profitable in every quarter of the severely adverse stress scenario again this year. In fact, our indirect auto and auto dealer floor plan portfolios combined are the two best-performing portfolios in our entire loan portfolio in the stress test. Now this highlights the high-quality, low-risk nature of our super prime-focused indirect auto portfolio along with our dealer centric floor plan businesses. Reflecting the power of the FirstMerit acquisition, we were one of the few regional banks to see our stressed total capital increase from the 2017 CCAR process despite the more difficult Fed scenario in 2018. Consistently high capital generation governed by strong risk management is highly correlated to the creation of shareholder value in our industry. Our performance in the 2018 CCAR process clearly indicates that we're on the right track. We materially increased our total payout in 2018 with quarterly dividend increasing 27% from $0.11 to $0.14 per share. This year will represent the eighth consecutive year of an increased dividend. The board also approved the repurchase of about $1.1 billion of common stock over the next four quarters. And consistent with our CCAR capital plan, we intend to frontload about three-quarters of the buyback into 2018, including the announced intention to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program for approximately $400 million of common stock this quarter. We understand prudent capital allocation is essential to delivering strong returns to our shareholders. The 2018 capital plan actions are consistent with our stated capital priorities which are to fund organic growth, first; increase our quarterly dividend, second; and finally, other uses including the return of capital via share repurchases. At this time we do not view traditional commercial bank acquisitions as being attractive, as potential candidates are not meeting our valuation expectations. Now as Mac has stated on previous occasions, we believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk management discipline will support higher dividends including a higher dividend payout ratio over time. As we've briefly outlined on slide 3, we developed Huntington's strategies with a vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns. Our profitability metrics are amongst the best in the industry and we have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe will drive continued high performance in the future. We continue to make meaningful, long-term investments in our businesses, particularly around our highly-engaged colleagues and customer experience, enabled by technology and particularly digital technology to drive organic growth. We're very pleased with how we're positioned and the opportunities ahead. Slide 4 illustrates our long-term financial goals which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. As a reminder, these goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on a reported GAAP basis, two years ahead of the original expectation. Our second quarter efficiency ratio was near the low end of our long-term goal as a result of our expense discipline and focus on revenue growth while continuing to invest in our businesses. We're on pace again to deliver our annual goal of positive operating leverage, which will represent our sixth consecutive year of doing so. Our credit metrics are simply excellent. On our second quarter losses were the 16th consecutive quarter where net charge-offs remained below our average through the cycle target range. Our 17.6% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top-performing regional bank. And these results demonstrate that our strategies are working and will continue to drive Huntington forward. Now, let's turn to slide 5 to review 2018 expectations and to discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. The local economies across our eight-state footprint continue to perform well and we remain optimistic on the near-term outlook. Unemployment rates remain near historical lows and we continue to see meaningful labor shortages in several footprint markets such as Columbus, Indianapolis and Grand Rapids. The Midwest, in fact, has the highest job opening rate in the nation so far in 2018, reflecting the dynamic region for potential job growth; the most dynamic region for potential job growth of the four major regions in the country according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' May JOLTS survey. As shown on the slide in the appendix, the Philadelphia Fed's state-leading indicator indices where our footprint point toward a favorable economic environment for the remainder of 2018. Most of the states are expected to see an acceleration in economic activity over the next six months. Four of our states, including Ohio, are expected to grow significantly faster than the nation. And while trade and tariff issues are creating some uncertainty in specific industries, we've not yet seen an impact on our customer base. We continue to have conversations with our clients and they remain optimistic for their businesses and the region, in large part reflecting the positive impact of federal tax reform and the overall strength of the economy. We are seeing broad-based commercial loan growth driven by increased capital expenditures including planned expansions. Our loan pipelines remained steady and moving to 2018 (11:15), we expect full-year average loan growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. And based on our current auto pricing strategy, we no longer expect to do an auto securitization this year. Full-year average deposit growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, while full-year growth in average core deposits is expected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. We expect full-year revenue growth of 5% to 6%. We project the GAAP NIM for the full-year will expand 2 basis points to 4 basis points compared to 2017 and we expect both the core and GAAP NIM will be up modestly in the third quarter of 2018. We remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We expect a 3% to 4% decrease in non-interest expense on a GAAP basis. And our expected efficiency ratio range is 55.5% to 56.5%, in line with our year-to-date results and an improvement from the full-year 2017 efficiency ratio of 61%. We anticipate the net charge-offs will remain below our average through the cycle target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. And our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range. Looking beyond 2018, we continue to make meaningful progress on the new three-year strategic planning process we kicked off in the first quarter. Our past two strategic plans significantly advanced the company's financial performance and competitive positioning. To continue this momentum, our areas of focus for the 2018 planning process are top-line revenue growth, capital optimization and business model evolution incorporating expected disruption. And we're fortunate to be in a position to build on the strong foundation of our previous strategic plan, which have positioned us as an industry leader in customer experience. We're focused on extending our customer experience advantage through a series of initiatives coming out of this year's strategic process that will allow us to improve customer acquisition while reducing customer attrition and deepen relationships with our customers. As always, our board of directors is highly engaged in the process, meeting for the last \u2013 for two days, just last week, to be followed up with a three-day board offsite in September to further refine a decision on the (13:48) new strategic plan. As we've stated previously, another important outcome of the strategic planning process will be new long-term financial goals for the company. We expect to be in a position to communicate those goals later this year. So, before I turn it over to Mac, I want to personally thank everyone who participated in our recent investor and analyst survey. We really appreciate hearing your thoughts on where we've met your expectations and as importantly, where we have opportunities to improve. The survey results are extremely valuable to us and to our board as we continue to work through our strategic planning process. As always, Mark and the IR team are available to anyone that didn't participate but would like to share your thoughts or concerns with us or the board. So, Mac, let me now ask you to provide an overview of the financials. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Slide 6 provides the highlights of the second quarter results. As Steve mentioned, we had a good second quarter. It was also a clean quarter, as for the third quarter in a row, there were no significant items other than the implementation of tax reform in the fourth quarter of 2017. We reported earnings per common share of $0.30, up 30% over the year ago quarter. The year ago quarter included a $0.03 per share reduction due to the FirstMerit integration related significant items. Return on assets was 1.36%. Return on common equity was 13.2%; and return on tangible common equity was 17.6%. We believe all three of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.6%. Tangible book value per share increased to 2% sequentially and 8% year-over-year to $7.27 per share. On slide 7, total revenue was up 4% from the year ago quarter. Net interest income was up 5% year-over-year due to a 5% increase in average earning assets. The non-interest income increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing household acquisition and execution of our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR strategy. While both mortgage and SBA originations were higher year-over-year, compression in secondary market spreads and mortgage banking and a higher mix of construction SBA originations, which lengthens the funding cycle for SBA loans, continue to impact these fee categories. Non-interest expense decreased 6% year-over-year, reflecting $50 million of significant items expensed in the year ago quarter related to the integration of FirstMerit versus none in the current quarter. Expenses were up versus the prior quarter, driven by the timing of compensation associated with long-term incentives and seasonally higher marketing expense. For a closer look at the income statement details, please refer to the analyst package and the press release. Turning to slide 8, average earning assets grew 5% from the second quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by a 7% increase in average loans and leases. Average C&I loans increased 3% year-over-year with growth centered in middle market, asset finance, energy and corporate banking. On a linked quarter basis, average C&I loans increased 2% or 7% annualized, with broad-based growth in middle market, asset finance, energy and specialty banking. Average commercial real estate loans were up 4% year-over-year while flat on a linked quarter basis as we have strategically tightened commercial real estate lending specifically in multi-family, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Average auto loans increased 8% year-over-year as a result of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.6 billion for the second quarter of 2018, down 2% year-over-year. We have been consistently increasing auto loan pricing, which slowed originations while optimizing revenue. The average new money yield on our auto originations was 4.22% in the quarter, up from 3.88% in the first quarter. Average RV and marine loans increased 31% year over year, reflecting the success of our expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two years. Linked quarter growth was 30% annualized driven by normal seasonality. Average residential mortgage loans increased 21% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong demand for mortgages across our footprint, as well as the benefit of ongoing investment in former FirstMerit geographies, particularly Chicago. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Turning the attention to the chart on the right side of the slide, average total deposits increased 4% from the year-ago quarter, including a 4% increase in average core deposits and a 6% increase in period end core deposits. Moving to slide 9, our net interest margin was 3.29% for the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter and down 1 basis point linked quarter. During the first half of 2018, we took a number of actions to position the balance sheet for higher interest rates, including the origination of approximately $3 billion of attractively priced fixed rate CDs through our branch network. We also closed out approximately $3 billion of pay-floating swaps on fixed rate long-term debt and issued $1.25 billion of fixed rate, long-term debt that was swapped back to floating with an average weighted maturity of 4.6 years. The net sum of these actions made our balance sheet more asset-sensitive and will help better manage our deposit beta over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, the second quarter of 2018 reflects the inflection point of balance sheet growth and core net interest margin improvement combined with runoff of purchase accounting accretion, allowing for expansion of our GAAP reported net interest margin to expand going forward. As Steve mentioned in his comments, we expect the GAAP reported net interest margin for full-year 2018 to expand 2 to 4 basis points over the full-year GAAP reported net interest margin for 2017. This would mean approximately 3 to 6 basis points of improvement in the GAAP reported net interest margin for each of the next two quarters. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 8 basis points to the net interest margin in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 15 basis points in the year-ago quarter. After adjusting for purchase accounting accretion in both quarters, the core NIM was 3.22% versus 3.16% in the second quarter of 2017. Growth in core net interest margin over the past year has more than offset the benefit in purchase accounting accretion. Slide 29 in the appendix provides information regarding the scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2018 and 2019. On the earning assets side, our commercial loan yields increased 41 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 16 basis points. Our deposit costs remained well contained with total interest bearing deposits of 59 basis points for the quarter, up 28 basis points year-over-year. Consumer core deposits were up 14 basis points year-over-year and commercial core deposits were up 25 basis points. On a linked quarter basis, the core NIM was unchanged at 3.22%. Average earning asset yields increased 16 basis points, including a 26-basis-point increase in commercial loan yields and a 9-basis-point increase in consumer loan yields. On the liabilities side, the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 16 basis points. Day count negatively impacted the net interest margin by 1 basis point on a linked-quarter basis. Our CD strategy negatively impacted the NIM by 1 basis point and derivative ineffectiveness on debt swaps had a negative impact of 3 basis points. Moving to slide 10, our cycle-to-date deposit beta remains low at 24% through the second quarter of 2018. While our CD funding strategy negatively impacted our cycle-to-date deposit beta by 2 basis points, we are better positioned for continued higher rates due to the strategy. As we told you last quarter, overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets. Assuming one additional rate increase in 2018, our current forecast assumes an incremental deposit beta of approximately 50% for calendar year 2018, driven by the shift in customer preferences to more rate-sensitive products, including money markets and CDs. Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.78%, up 37 basis points year-over-year. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.53%, up 65 basis points year-over-year. Moving to slide 12, credit quality remained strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite. We booked provisional expense of $56 million in the second quarter, including $8 million of allowance for unfunded loan commitments, compared to net charge-offs of $28 million. The loan loss provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong loan growth and continued migration of the acquired FirstMerit portfolio into the originated portfolio. As a reminder, our provision expense has exceeded net charge-offs in 11 out of the past 12 quarters while driving material earnings power improvement. Net charge-off represented an annualized 16 basis points of average loans and leases which remained below average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down 5 basis points from the prior quarter and the year ago quarter. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans increased 1 basis point linked quarter to 1.02% and coverage of non-accrual loans was 197%. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased 2 basis points linked quarter to 1.15%. Turning to slide 13, overall asset quality metrics remained near cyclical lows and some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans. The non-performing asset ratio decreased 2 basis points sequentially to 57 basis points. The criticized asset ratio decreased 11 basis points from 3.60% to 3.49%. Slide 14 highlights Huntington's strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pre-tax pre-provision net revenue as a result of the focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to fund organic growth in the future and return capital to our shareholders, consistent with our capital priorities. The top right chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and a commercial bank and believe the diversification of the balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left, which Steve discussed earlier, highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management. Finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington's strong capital position. As we've returned to the key messages on slide 15, let me turn the presentation back over to Mark for Q&A Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Jessie, we will now take questions. We ask that, as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she may add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. Hey, Mac, thanks for the color on the expectation for how the NIM should traject in the second half. I was wondering that's a pretty big step-up, 3 basis points to 6 basis points per quarter. Can you help us understand the \u2013 literally the \u2013 separate the left side and right side of the balance sheet and where that will be driven from? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, Ken, I think a number of things will impact going forward. I do think we're being more aggressive on asset pricing. We've increased pricing in indirect auto. We've increased pricing in boat and RV. We've increased pricing in residential mortgage and we continue to be very disciplined and appropriately priced on the commercial portfolio. So we continue to see good expansion there, in particular, as we take some of these pricing actions. I think on the liability side, given the CD strategy that we put in place in really the middle of the first quarter of this year, we did expect to see some accelerated deposit costs. We also expected to see the loan growth that we've been seeing. So we wanted to make sure that we got ahead of that with core funding. We feel very good about the product that we put on the books. We've had very, I would say, good reception from our customer base, good execution by the retail branches in terms of raising about $3 billion to-date. And we do think that longer term that's going to position us well as interest rates continue to rise. We should see this help us both with asset sensitivity and with the deposit beta as going forward. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up, maybe you can also help us understand your reinvestment yields on new securities. I know you're changing the composition of the book, but versus the 271 basis points (28:33), what are you putting on stuff on? And on the right \u2013 lower right side, is there anything going on in the long-term debt line that should also revert relative to the big spike you saw in the cost on that line this quarter? Thanks a lot, Mac. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. So, we are not reinvesting into the security portfolio at this point in time. We're going to continue to run that down through the end of the year, basically not reinvesting cash flow. If you think about where we started the year to where we're going to end the year, the securities portfolio would be down about $1.8 billion. You need to cut through the noise because we do have some municipal loans that are counted as securities that are growing in that book. But basically, the pure investment security portfolio will be down $1.8 billion by the end of the year. We'll start to reinvest in 2019, but we're in really good shape from an LCR perspective right now and we're going to continue to run that down. We did issue some long-term debt. We did issue the $1.25 billion, $500 million of that was seven-year and $750 million was three-year. We did swap that to floating but we likely will have another issuance of debt later this year. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thanks a lot, Mac. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Morning. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Morning, John. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : On your full-year 2018 outlook, I know you kind of bumped up the midpoint of your revenue expectation. You bumped down the midpoint of your expense expectation a bit versus previously. But the midpoint of your efficiency ratio guidance is unchanged despite tweaking the tails a bit. So why not see more of a move in the midpoint of that range? Thanks. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. I think basically the ranges would allow us to calculate out to the range of the efficiency ratio based upon the mix of revenue and expense, feel very comfortable with the range that we provided across all those categories. We did tighten them somewhat significantly in this guidance. But basically, within those ranges, those are the efficiency ratios that we feel comfortable with. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. So, not meaningful enough really to move the midpoint? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's the way to think about it. I mean, we likely were this tight in the range when you think about prior guidance. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Got it. Okay. And then separately, on the betas, I know that part of that jump up in the beta cumulatively this quarter was from the CD program. How do you think about next quarter? And I know you are indicating you're expecting an incremental beta of about 50% through the back half of the year. How \u2013 what do you view your terminal beta as well? At what point do you think \u2013 or at what level do you see the terminal getting to? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, the 50% for 2018, feel very comfortable with that. That actually might be a little bit high but I would say not materially. And going forward, we continue to think that we're going to be continuing to see deposit betas increase. I'm just not sure at this point in the cycle as we think about the rate increases that are coming that we're going to see materially different performance when you think about incremental 50% in 2019 based upon the rate increases that we see coming through. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. It's actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey Ricky. Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just wanted to touch on loan growth. You saw some good strong growth in the commercial book. And I'm wondering if you could sort of flesh that out a little bit more, just what are customers saying? Is there an uptick in investment spend and just your general sense as to the climate out there among corporate clients? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Ricky, this is Dan. I would say that we still have a strong pipeline. I think our customer base, overall, is fairly optimistic. I think what you saw this quarter, we had good diversification in the various categories. If you recall, last year, corporate banking, they had big headwinds with bond issues taking out loans. I think that phenomenon has really led up and we're gaining some traction in the large corporate space. Some of our specialty businesses have had good results. Our energy book, which \u2013 our E&P book had always been very modest. It still is of a modest size, so we've had some good growth there because we like the structure and the pricing. Middle market has seen good growth. So, it's broad and it's diversified. And so, still very positive. Some headwinds out there, we believe, from the trade talk. While I don't think its impacted customers outlook yet that is something we're keeping an eye on. Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on the boat, RV lending piece. Obviously, you've seen some pretty nice pick-up there. Just wondering how big can that become over time. And do you guys have sort of a limit on capital as to how big that can grow in the out years? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. So, given the size of the portfolio, we started very small, so there is room for growth, but we have established a concentration limit. And so, we like the business but the growth is going to be controlled. We're now in 34 states. I don't see that growing in the near-term. But when you look at what we're originating, very high FICO. The customer profile remains very strong. And so, we do have room to grow, but we have capped that growth internally. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you just elaborate a little bit, the change that you guys have made to make your balance sheet a little more asset sensitive, I guess, can you just walk through the decision process? Why make that decision now versus a quarter or two quarters ago? Thanks. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, Ken, we analyze the situation weekly. We spend a lot of time in ALCO, sub-ALCO, a lot of committees taking a look at the position, looking at different options that we can take. We basically made the call on the CD strategy in the first quarter because we became more convinced that we were going to see rates rise from here, more probable than what we might have thought in 2017, and started to put those deposits on, as I mentioned, because we also saw the loan growth coming at us. In terms of what we did with the debt swaps, we did contemplate taking those off earlier to become more asset-sensitive. We were doing other things along the way to become more asset-sensitive. In general, we feel pretty comfortable with where we are. We're about 6% and that's a 200-basis-point ramp. So we don't want to get ahead of the situation. We don't want to fall behind the situation but we feel very comfortable with where we are. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. And then, my follow-up, in terms of capital return obviously, in my view, I think you're demonstrating your willingness to be more aggressive or as aggressive as you can be in terms of returning capital. Would you consider sort of a mid-year resubmission to ask for more capital return or given the environment and kind of given your capital ratios, are you completely comfortable sort of where you're at with this \u2013 with the current $1 billion authorization? Thanks. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, we're targeting at 9% to 10% CET1. We have had better asset growth relative to what we submitted in the CCAR plan. So, on a risk-weighted asset basis, we're a little bit higher than what we expected but still very comfortable and very \u2013 I would say higher in that 9% to 10% range. I think we just have to continue to see how the economy progresses. I think we have to see what happens with the interest rate environment and make that decision as we take the various factors into consideration. We do think that our 9% to 10% CET1 target positions us well relative to the peer group. We do see the peer group bringing CET1 levels down. So we have to take all those things into consideration when we decide if we'll do that kind of in a midyear process. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: There's also Federal Reserve action, Ken, that's expected as a result of the recent legislation for banks our size. And the timetable for that's not clear but it's intended to be within 18 months. Hopefully it's sooner and that'll give us some guidance. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Morning, guys. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Scott. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Scott. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey. Mac, maybe I was hoping you could expand a little on your thoughts on the competitive dynamics in both the auto and marine, RV businesses. I mean you guys have clearly had some success raising prices in both. And I guess just as I look at them, auto, you've had some larger players sort of deemphasizing that business, which presumably is good for you guys, but then marine, RV maybe some newer entrants getting in. So, just hoping you could update your thoughts on how the competitive dynamic is in each of those businesses. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: So, I'll start and maybe Steve or Dan want to add to it, but I think in the auto space, we're very well positioned with our customers who are the auto dealers. I mean we've been in this space for over 60 years. We provide a high level of service when you think about the response time, when you think about same-day funding. We do some things that other banks just don't do. And I think that really puts us in a very strong relationship position with those dealers. We're not changing our risk appetite as it relates to this business, we're super fine. And we do think that we can optimize the balance sheet, optimize revenue by increasing pricing in the indirect auto space and that's what we've been doing to the point where we don't need a securitization this year in order to stay our limits. So, we think that's just smart balance sheet and capital optimization. And we believe that we've got the pricing power and the relationships to be able to do that in the indirect auto space. But marine and RV, there really are six major players nationally in that business. It's probably not as dependent on technology as the indirect auto space might be. But again it comes down to the relationships that you have and be in there to be able to service those dealers. It's a space where we're going to continue to make investments and we'll likely bring some additional technology into that space, but we feel that just given our market share and given our position, we do have some pricing power. And part of it also is the level of customer service that we provide that allows the actions to take place. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : All right. Perfect. Thanks. And then can I have just one sort of piggyback question on the margin guidance. So, when you talk about the GAAP margins being up a couple basis points versus the 2017 number. Are you using the 330 basis points (41:14) FTE margin for full-year 2017 or are you not including the FTE adjustment? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: We always use the FTE. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Sorry. I figured as much, but just want to make sure... Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. Good question. Good question. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys, very much. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Op: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, everybody. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Steve. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the deposit side, what was the term and cost of the CDs that you guys added in the quarter? And is that strategy of building these out continuing in the third quarter? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yes. So we're basically somewhere between 19 and 26 months, and the rates between 2.20% and 2.50% (42:10) is the way to think about it. We are continuing with the campaign and the activity. And I would say we've been averaging about $600 million a month in production pretty consistently. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. I'm curious, is this (42:31) optimism has been really strong in your footprint, but regarding the uncertainty around tariffs, is this impacting your commercial loan pipelines at all? What are you hearing from your customers on that front? Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Yeah. So, I would say at this point, it is not impacting the pipelines, but obviously we'll have to watch the pull-through rate, and if sentiment changes, the longer this goes on. Right now, as I mentioned before, I think our customer base, they're monitoring the situation, they're cautionary, but still going ahead with plans that they've had in place for investment. So we haven't seen the impact at this point. I think the outlook still remains pretty positive. Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just back on deposits, can you touch a little bit up on the consumer deposit growth for the quarter? I guess, one of the numbers that stood out was the non-interest bearing demand growth and curious what drove that? And if you could maybe tie that into the customer acquisition and reduced attrition comment that you talked about in your longer term plans? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Sure, Jon. So, I think we continue to be, I think, advantaged and strong in terms of household acquisition on the consumer side. There is some seasonality in the second quarter that actually worked against us but we continue to have good new account origination. I think that's a big driver of it. And I think also, being able to get deeper into the FirstMerit book of business has been helpful as well. But we haven't published statistics around OCR and some of the household acquisition that we've seen for a while but we continue to see good growth and good household acquisition. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Okay. Good. And then, to Steve, one for you, the labor shortage comment. That seems to come up every quarter but maybe it seems a little bit more acute from the tone of your voice when you talked about it this quarter. Would you say is it a bigger problem for you and does that concern you longer term? Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: I do think it's a restraining factor in terms of the economic potential in our footprint. It was surprising to me to see our jobs availability being higher than every other region of the country, Jon. And so that underlying strength and the potential makes me bullish long-term, but clearly, it's holding us back at some level. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: Hey, Brian. Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. So Mac, I just want to have a follow-up question really quickly, and I'm sorry if I missed it earlier, but for the full-year revenue guidance, do you now include a September hike in further \u2013 for the back half of the year? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: We do. Yes, we do have a September hike in the back half of the year. Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And just really on the deposit beta, so the 50% would be your deposit beta for the full-year 2018. So, the expectation is that there will be another ramp in the back half of the year with that September hike that would be higher than the second quarter? Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: That is the way we would model. We're expecting the 50% to be for the full-year. Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: And we think we're probably 40%, 43%, something in that range kind of where we sit today. Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got you. But obviously, the NIM expansion is going to come from the earning asset side of this, they're getting the benefit from that rolling through for the second half of the year. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: That's correct. Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for your time. Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for closing remarks. Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.: We are clearly building long-term shareholder value with this top quartile financial performance, combined with strong risk management and our execution of our strategies. And then we had a strong first half for the year, good growth, clean credit, high-quality earnings, and we believe we're well positioned for the remainder of the year and beyond. So, finally, I'd always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management and our colleagues and shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the seventh largest shareholder of Huntington and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington today. We appreciate you joining us and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thank you, Sherry. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1 hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Stephen Steinour : Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had another very good quarter and as we continued to deliver high-quality earnings and expect to carry this momentum through the end of the year. It was also another clean quarter as for the third quarter in a row, there were no significant items. We reported net income of $378 million and earnings per share of $0.33, increases of 37% and 43%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2017. Return on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 19%. We had record revenue of $1.2 billion, which represented a 5% year-over-year increase and maintained strong expense discipline. We're pleased with the resulting efficiency ratio of 55.3%, an improvement of 520 basis points from the year ago quarter. The average total loan increase was strong at 7% versus the third quarter of 2017 and 5% annualized versus the 2018 second quarter. This loan growth was driven by a 10% year-over-year increase in average consumer loans with particular strength in residential mortgage, RV and marine financing and automobile lending. We remain focused on core funding the balance sheet with 6% growth in average core deposits. In the third quarter, we increased the quarterly common dividend to $0.14 per share, representing a 27% linked quarter increase and a 75% year-over-year increase. This year marks the eighth consecutive year that we've increased the common dividend. We believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk management discipline will support higher dividends, including a higher dividend payout ratio over time. We also repurchased $691 million of common shares or approximately 65% of the total repurchase included in our 2018 CCAR capital plan. As briefly outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through-the-cycle shareholder returns. Our profitability metrics are among the best in the industry, and we have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe will deliver high performance in the future. The franchise continues to perform well in many fronts, allowing us to make investments in capabilities we need to drive consistent organic growth. We're focused on driving sustained long-term performance for our shareholders. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which we put in place 8 years ago. And as a reminder, we reinforced the importance of these standards by requiring the top 1,400 officers of the company to comply with hold-to-retirement restrictions on their equity awards. Slide 4 illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. As a reminder, these goals were originally set with a 5-year time horizon in mind, and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on a reported GAAP basis, 2 years ahead of original expectations. I've already touched on our record revenues, the continued expense discipline and our third quarter efficiency ratio, which was below the low end of our long-term goal. In addition to our credit metrics -- our credit metrics remain excellent. The third quarter of 2018 was the 17th consecutive quarter where net charge-offs remained below our average through-the-cycle target range and loan provisions in excess of that charge-offs have been taken in 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our 19% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top-performing regional bank. Now these results demonstrate that our strategies are clearly working and will continue to drive Huntington forward. So let's turn to Slide 5 to review 2018 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. The local economies across our 8-state footprint continue to perform well, and we remain optimistic on the near-term outlook. Unemployment rates remain near historical lows, and we continue to seek labor shortages throughout our footprint markets. The Midwest, in fact, has the highest job opening rate in the nation so far in 2018. Of the 4 major regions of the country, the Midwest is the most dynamic region for potential jobs growth according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics August JOLTS survey. The employment and growth opportunities in Midwest continue to make it a favorable economic region. 6 of our 8 footprint states experienced net population in-migration in 2017. In fact, 2017 was the first year Ohio had net immigration in a quarter of a century. As shown on Slide 70 in the appendix, the Philadelphia Fed's state leading economic indicator indices for our footprint point toward a favorable economic operating environment for the next 6 months. While the impact of the ongoing tariff issues, some positive and some negative, can be seen in specific industries, we've not yet seen a material impact to our customer base overall. The uncertainty regarding NAFTA was far more impactful to our customer base and our footprint. And we're encouraged by the new USMCA trade agreement as we believe it will be beneficial to our footprint, especially within the auto industry. Customer optimism has materialized throughout 2018 as we've seen our customers invest in capital expenditures and grow their businesses. Our commercial pipeline is up year-over-year. Consumers are doing well, with consumer loan growth remaining steady. It's a good time to be doing business in the Midwest, and we remain bullish on our local economies. Now moving to our updated 2018 expectations. We expect the full year average loan growth rate growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, consistent with our year-over-year growth for the first 9 months. But the fourth quarter provides a challenging comparison given the significant amount of growth at the end of last year following the federal tax reform. Loan growth rates in the third quarter and so far in October have been encouraging. Full year average deposit growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, while full year growth in average core deposits is expected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. We remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening core deposit relationships. We expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%, and during the fourth quarter, we expect to realize approximately $20 million of security losses related to a portfolio restructuring. This will allow us to optimize the securities portfolio, improving the revenue outlook for 2019. The modest reduction in our 2018 revenue outlook is related to the cost of the portfolio restructure -- restructuring as all remaining aspects of our prior revenue expectations remain intact. We continue to project the GAAP NIM for the full year will expand by 2 to 4 basis points compared to 2017. We expect NIM expansion in the fourth quarter on a GAAP and core basis will be in the range of 4 to 6 basis points. We will deliver positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We expect a 2% to 2.5% decrease in noninterest expense on a GAAP basis. Full year expenses are now projected to be slightly higher than previous guidance as we expect to incur approximately $40 million of expense in the fourth quarter related to the recently announced consolidation of 70 branches and some additional corporate facilities. The run rate cost savings associated with these consolidations will be entirely redeployed into targeted investments in both people and technology, and specifically, digital and mobile technology. We anticipate the net charge-offs will remain below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectations for the full year 2018 effective tax rate is in the 14.5% to 15% range. Before I turn it over to Mac, I'd like to give you a quick update on the strategic planning process we began earlier in the year. We're excited about the progress we've made and the meaningful discussions geared by our Board of Directors, the executive leadership team and many dedicated colleagues in Huntington. In September, we had a 3-day board offsite to further refine and decision the strategic plan. And last week the board had another robust set of conversations as we are nearing completion of the plan. As we previously mentioned, we anticipate new long-term financial goals will be an important outcome of the new strategic plan, and we look forward to sharing those with you later this year. So Mac will now provide an overview of our financial performance. Mac? Howell McCullough : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides the highlights of the third quarter results. As Steve mentioned, we had a strong third quarter. We recorded earnings per common share of $0.33, up 43% over the year ago quarter. Adjusting for $31 million of acquisition-related significant items in the third quarter of 2017, core EPS was up $0.08 or 32% year-over-year. We are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses as evidenced by our 5% year-over-year revenue growth and our 55.3% efficiency ratio, down 520 basis points from the year ago quarter. Return on assets was 1.4%, return on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 19%. We believe all 3 of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. Tangible book value per share increased 3% year-over-year to $7.06, even with a considerable share repurchase in the quarter. Lastly, the tax rate was 14.1% during the third quarter, which was impacted by a $3 million benefit from stock-based compensation and a $3 million benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Turning now to Slide 7. Average earning assets grew 4% from the third quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by a 7% growth in average loans and leases, including broad-based strength in consumer lending. Average residential mortgage loans increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in loan officers as well as further expansion into the Chicago market. As we typically do, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Average C&I loans increased 4% year-over-year with growth centered in middle market, asset finance, energy and corporate banking. On an inter-period basis, C&I balances increased 5% linked quarter annualized as we saw a healthy pickup in originations in the final month of the quarter. Average auto loans increased 6% year-over-year as a result of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2018, down 15% year-over-year. This was deliberate, as we've been consistently increasing auto loan pricing, which slowed originations while optimizing revenue. The average new money yield on our auto originations was 4.62% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from 4.22% in the second quarter and up 100 basis points from 3.62% in the year ago quarter. Average RV and marine loans increased 31% year-over-year, reflecting the success of the well-managed expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two years. Linked quarter growth was 52% annualized, reflecting the normal seasonality during the summer months. Average commercial real estate loans were down 1% on a year-over-year basis and down 3% on a linked-quarter basis. This reflects anticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending, specifically in multifamily, retail and construction in order to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Finally, securities were down 3% year-over-year as we continued to let the portfolio runoff and remix the cash flows into higher-yielding loan products. Turning now to Slide 8. Average total deposits grew 5% year-over-year, including a 6% increase in average core deposits. Core certificates of deposit were up 141% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the initiatives during the past 3 quarters to grow fixed rate term consumer deposits in light of the raising -- rising interest rate environment. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 7%. This was almost entirely driven by our commercial customers as they continue to shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market. However, as shown on Slide 37 in the appendix, our core consumer noninterest-bearing deposits were actually up 5% year-over-year as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships. Average money market deposits were up 6% year-over-year, driven by solid growth in consumer balances and preferences of commercial customers shifting towards higher yielding products. On a linked-quarter basis, total deposits grew $2.2 billion or 3%, reducing our average short-term borrowings in the quarter by 44%. We remain focused on core funding the balance sheet in the current rising interest rate environment. Moving now to Slide 9. Our net interest income increased $39 million or 5% versus the year ago quarter. Driving this growth was the 4% increase in earning assets and rising yields in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Our GAAP net interest margin was 3.32% for the third quarter, up 3 basis points from the year ago quarter and up 3 basis points linked quarter. The third quarter was impacted by a slower rise in short-term rates as average 1-month LIBOR increased 14 basis points during the quarter versus 63 basis points in the first half of the year. We do not anticipate the same headwind in the fourth quarter. Moving to Slide 10. Our core net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.25%, up 7 basis points from the year ago quarter and up 3 basis points linked quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 7 basis points to the net interest margin compared to 12 basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 33 in the appendix provides information regarding the scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting accretion for 2018 and 2019. On earning asset slide, our commercial loan yields increased 59 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 22 basis points. Our deposit costs remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 73 basis points for the quarter up 38 basis points year-over-year. Consumer core deposits costs were up 26 basis points year-over-year and commercial core deposits costs were up 27 basis points. Moving now to Slide 11. Our cycle-to-date deposit beta remains low at 28% through the third quarter of 2018, which is still well below our expectations. While our CD funding strategy negatively impacted our deposit beta in the second and third quarters, our core deposit growth continues to outpace peers, and we'll be better positioned for continued interest rate increases in the future. As we told you last quarter, overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets. Slide 12 provides detail on our noninterest income for the quarter and comparison to the year ago quarter. Our noninterest income increased $12 million or 4% from the third quarter of 2017. We are seeing momentum in our fee businesses, driven by our ongoing household and relationship acquisition and the execution of our strategies, including our Optimal Customer Relationship strategy. Slide 13 highlights the key drivers in our 4% year-over-year reduction in reported noninterest expense. Comparisons to the third quarter of 2017 are impacted by $31 million of acquisition-related significant items in the year ago quarter. We remain focused on expense control, while also investing in our key businesses. Our efficiency ratio has trended down, reflecting the successful cost-save initiatives from the FirstMerit acquisition. Slide 14 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.25%, down 17 basis points year-over-year. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.89%, down 5 basis points year-over-year and down 64 basis points linked quarter. CET1 is now back within our operating guideline of 9% to 10%. We expect to stay near the upper end of this range given the length of the current recovery and where we believe we are in the economic cycle. Slide 15 illustrates our previously articulated capital priorities, which have been confirmed during the current strategic planning process. Our first priority is to fund organic growth of the balance sheet. Our second priority is the cash dividend. As Steve mentioned earlier, we were pleased to be able to increase our cash dividend materially this quarter. This was enabled by the significant improvement in capital generation driven over the past few years and our strong results in the DFAST and CCAR processes. Our final capital priority is everything else, which includes share repurchases and selective M&A. Our $691 million share repurchase during the third quarter include a $400 million ASR. We use the ASR to effectively offset the dilution incurred during the first quarter from our Series A preferred equity conversion as was contemplated in our CCAR submission. Excluding the onetime nature of this ASR, the total payout ratio this year would look closer to our long-term payout ratio targets versus the elevated 112% year-to-date payout ratio shown on the slide. We previously stated that we have a long-term total payout ratio target of 70% to 80% and a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 45%. We continue to view whole bank M&A as an unattractive use of capital at this time given the highly inflated seller's expectations and where we believe we are in the economic cycle. Earlier this month, we closed on a previously announced acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co, a small specialty broker-dealer with expertise in municipal underwriting. This is a small bolt-on acquisition, which is a nice addition to our government banking and capital markets businesses. Moving to Slide 16. Credit quality remained strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of $49 million in the third quarter compared to net charge-offs of $29 million. The loan loss provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong loan growth and continued migration of the acquired FirstMerit portfolio into the originated portfolio. We have now booked provision expense above net charge-offs for 12 of the past 13 quarters, illustrating our high-quality earnings. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 16 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were flat from the prior quarter and down 9 basis points from the year ago quarter. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans increased 2 basis points linked quarter to 1.04%, while the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans also increased 2 basis points linked quarter to 1.17%. Slide 17 highlights Huntington's strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pretax preprovision net revenue as a result of focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to support balance sheet growth and return capital to our shareholders at an advantage rate over the long term. The top right chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and commercial bank and believe that the diversification of this balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management. And finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington's strong capital position. Turning now to Slide 18. This new slide highlights Huntington's continued investment in our customer experience advantage, with a focus on human-led technology-enabled delivery and solutions. We are seeing an ongoing shift towards mobile and digital usage by our customers. 62% of our households are digitally active, and we would expect that figure will continue to increase materially in the years to come. On the top right of the slide, you can see a few of the most recent mobile and digital initiatives. As you can imagine, the current strategic planning process has a significant focus on digital and mobile technology, and we will share more details once the plan is finalized. We remain focused on extending our customer experience advantage through targeted investment. As previously announced, we are consolidating 70 branches and a handful of corporate facilities in the fourth quarter. The strategic decision to consolidate these offices is the result of our continuous review of our distribution channels and our customers' perceptions, behaviors and needs. The run rate costs -- savings associated with these consolidations will be entirely deployed in the targeted investments in technology, specifically digital, in order to better serve our customers. Let me now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Thanks, Mac. Sherry, we'll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Mac, wondering if you can just help us flush out the incremental securities loss and then the incremental charges on your previously announced restructuring charges? And maybe even more so than understanding the fourth quarter, help us understand the return on those? And how we should expect that to affect the '19 starting points for both the securities portfolio yield and also just for the cost base? Howell McCullough : Thanks, Ken. So we're selling about $1.1 billion of investment securities in the fourth quarter, and we will replace those one-for-one. So there won't be an increase in the securities portfolio from this action. Basically, it's a shorter-duration, low-yielding securities. And the payback is pretty quick, under two years, on this transaction. We're going to get a net yield pickup of about 1.2%, which should translate into about $13 million in additional net interest income in 2019. So we do see this as good hygiene and continuing to make sure that we stay efficient with the balance sheet and think about opportunities. On the expense side, so this is basically related to the 70-branch consolidation that will take place in the fourth quarter. And there will be some corporate facilities that we will be closing, consolidating as part of that as well. And we estimate that to be approximately $40 million and it would be the typical expenses that you see in these types of activities. And when you think about the 2018 guidance and the change to the 2018 guidance for both revenue and expense, these items impacted those changes to a very large degree, entirely on the expense side and primarily on the revenue side. So shouldn't think about this really as being a change in core guidance for 2018. This is really about these actions that we're taking in the fourth quarter. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. And my follow up, Mac, just on that expense point. If I follow you on that and just put in the $40 million on the expense side, it would still seem that underlying that, you're still expecting a decent increase in kind of underlying cost growth third to fourth. Can you just level set us on that versus the $651 million result you just put up, the type of underlying expense growth you're still expecting in 4Q? Howell McCullough : Yes, Ken, so it is somewhat seasonal. We do have higher expenses in the fourth quarter. I would tell you there's not anything out of the ordinary relative to what we've seen historically in the fourth quarter, just the fact that we do have higher revenue because of seasonal actions taking place in the fourth quarter by our customers and the expenses that come along with that. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom : Question on lending. When you talk about your pipelines and the outlook, this mid-single-digit pace that you guys have put up, maybe even a little bit better, Steve, I'm just curious, longer term, do you see any threats to that? Or do you feel like that's a sustainable pace for the company? Stephen Steinour : Thanks, John. We are sitting with pipeline that's largely equivalent to where we were this time last year on both the consumer and commercial side. As we look forward, we're bullish on the economy and our footprint. There is certainly a line of macro volatility right now, so that could impact things, but we're optimistic. And getting the NAFTA risk off the table is a big step forward for us in this region. Underlying commercial demand seems to, if anything, be triggered by a constraint on employment, and we have many, many customers throughout all of our regions now suggesting that they could do more if they had more labor. So there's clearly a labor supply impact going on. And then additionally, we've been outplayed a bit and have had a lot of commentary about pipelines now going into 2020. So it would appear to be -- it would appear that business is consistent. And to be at this time of the year with backlogs into 2020 is a bit unusual. So very positive to the year. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. And then, not necessarily an M&A question, but Mac's comment about having less interest in M&A because of where we are on the economic cycle. I'm just curious, where you think we are in the economic cycle? And are you, or maybe Dan, could comment, seeing any kind of stress or irrational behavior? Howell McCullough : Yes. No, I think that irrational behavior -- I mean, we're definitely seeing people pick their spots in terms of being quite aggressive, but that really is nothing to -- we've seen that for some time. So I think it's pretty much the status quo. In terms of where we are on the cycle, we're several late in the cycle. I think this is the third year that we've said we're late in the cycle. So we continue to plan and look at our portfolio and view new transactions in light of the fact that we have to be prepared at all times for a downturn, whether that happens 18 months from now or 3 years from now. So it really hasn't changed that posture. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Robert Siefers : I was hoping you could sort of rewalk through the margin expectations for the fourth quarter. I know, Mac, after the second quarter, you guys have been thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 to 6 basis points of core margin improvement per quarter in the second half. So -- I know LIBOR was sort of an issue for you and others this quarter, so maybe you got off to a slower start, kind of bottom end of the range. But if you can rewalk through what the expectations for core and reported would be for the fourth quarter and then the main puts and takes as you see them? Howell McCullough : Yes, Scott. So we believe that we're going to see expansion in the fourth quarter NIM, both for core and reported, 4 to 6 basis points. Part of that is just understanding that we're not going to have the same impacts with LIBOR in the third quarter -- like we did in the third quarter in the fourth quarter. The other part of it is we continue to remain very disciplined on asset pricing and just making sure that we're getting paid appropriately for the risks that we're taking. And we also are anticipating maybe a lower deposit beta in the fourth quarter. So those things coming together along with the recent rate increase, we feel confident that the 4 to 6 basis point expansion for both core and reported in the fourth quarter is very doable. Robert Siefers : Okay, perfect. And then I just want to make sure -- sorry, this might sound a little vague in here, but I just want to make sure I understand the expense guide. So we're starting off the 2017 reported dollars of expenses and now we're taking, I guess, it's the 2% to 2.5% off of that and then the guidance includes the $40 million of expenses that are sort of unusual. So are we effectively in the middle of that range, implying a fourth quarter expense somewhere of about $670 million when you net out the year-to-date expenses you already incurred? Howell McCullough : That probably sounds a little bit high. Again, the fourth quarter is seasonally higher from an expense perspective. But that would be the math that you'd want to go through, Scott, in order to be able to do that. Operator : Our next question is from John Pancari [ph] with Evercore ISI. Samuel Ross : This is Sam Ross on for John Pancari. Just a quick question on the auto securitizations. I'm just wondering if there's any updated plans for the near term in that regard? Howell McCullough : At this point in time, we don't have plans for auto securitization. We've -- the increased pricing that we've been able to execute on the auto book has helped us pull volume back and really maintain revenue where we expected it to be, even at a higher origination number with lower rates. So we feel confident in terms of how we're managing the exposure on the balance sheet and don't really see in auto securitization in the future. Samuel Ross : That's helpful. And then, looking at your tax rate, it seems like the tax rate is coming in lower than you had previously expected. And I'm just wondering if this is a function of some of the moving parts or onetime items that you have seen? Or is this like the normalized run rate we should expect going forward? Howell McCullough : Yes, what you need to adjust for in the third quarter is $3 million of benefit related to stock-based comp and $3 million related to the true-up of tax reform in 2017. If you adjust for that $6 million, you'll be at 15.5% for the third quarter, and that is the low end of a range that we have been giving you earlier for first, second quarter. So we're still in that 15.5% to 16.5% range, it's just these 2 unusual items this quarter that took us down. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Steven Alexopoulos : On the deposit side, if we look at the sharp growth again in time deposits, where would you guys ultimately like to take those balances to? Howell McCullough : Well, we've -- if you take a look over time, Steve, and we've actually run CD balances, time deposits off pretty significantly over a number of years. This really is the first year that we've started to grow that portfolio again. We don't really have a target for it. The growth has slowed down. Basically, we're not the price leader in the market right now, in the region right now on the CD products, but we're still getting decent growth, I would say, on a monthly basis. We just felt that, that was a smart move for us in the first quarter as we saw the loan growth materializing for the year and wanting to stay core funded without impacting some of the backlogs, say, in money market or savings. So we put the promotion in place in kind of the middle of first quarter, and we've raised probably over $3 billion since then and feel really good about the term and the rates that we paid. So it's not going to be -- become a significant portion of our core deposit funding going forward. It's more situational, just given the rate environment and what's happening right now. Steven Alexopoulos : Got you. Okay. And then, just a follow-up. If we look at deposit costs up 14 bps quarter-over-quarter and the time deposits were a part of that. How do you think that continues to trend going forward? Is 14 bps a reasonable range? Or does some pressure come off as maybe you slow time deposit growth? Howell McCullough : Yes, I think some pressure will come off of that, Steve. And I think we are seeing time deposit growth slow down. And we're also being cautious with deposit pricing in the fourth quarter. We're thinking of a big growth at the rates that we're paying today. So I do expect the deposit beta in the fourth quarter to be lower than the year-to-date deposit beta. So that's where we stand. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Concerning your lowering the deposit beta in the fourth quarter. I mean, do you expect the deposit beta to run a little bit lower going to the first half of '19? Or do you think that's going to reaccelerate just given your guidance for 50% cumulative deposit beta? Howell McCullough : Yes, so we still feel comfortable with that 50% cumulative deposit beta. We're at about 50% year-to-date in 2018. And I would tell you that the fourth quarter is probably somewhat situational in terms of where we are and the deposit flows that we see. I would still think about that 50% longer-term deposit beta as being the right way to model going forward. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then can you talk about the deposit flows that you're seeing on the consumer side versus the commercial side and the betas you're seeing on commercial versus consumer, especially around noninterest-bearing deposits? Howell McCullough : Yes. So we haven't disclosed betas consumer versus commercial, but we do continue to see good consumer growth of 5% year-over-year growth and in core, checking accounts balances is really strong. And we've also seen good money market growth as well. So very, very comfortable with what's happening on the consumer side of the business and the growth that we're seeing. And commercial, as you know, is competitive. We evaluate every request that we get for a rate increase, and we look at the depth of the relationship and the strength of the opportunity going forward and deciding if we're -- what we're going to pay out for those deposits. So I think we have a very good process in place that's serving us well, and we're managing that side of the balance sheet appropriately. Operator : Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Brocker Vandervliet : Just following up on some of these deposit questions. Borrowings and noncore deposits have been clearly headed the other way. Is the goal to effectively run those out? Howell McCullough : Well, we do like to minimize both those balances as best we can, and we think about that as being a bit of a feeling around what we might be willing to pay on commercial deposits and thinking about how we manage that side of the balance sheet. We certainly don't have a plan to minimize other types of funding, but to the extent we can raise good core deposits at the right cost, we're going to continue to do that. And we've been actually very successful doing that in 2018. So feel good about where we're positioned and the deposit flows that we're seeing. And wouldn't be surprised if we stay around these levels in terms of overnight funding and those other types of funding sources. Brocker Vandervliet : And then just stepping back, I mean, the more common pattern across the industry appears to be acceleration in betas, a more violent mix shift into higher cost deposits. And you called that out as occurring more rapidly on the commercial side. But overall your deltas and deposit costs are actually down sequentially. Do you think that's more a factor of your own strategy and tactics or a lack of competitive response or a bit of both? Howell McCullough : I would say a bit of both. I think the competition in the region has remained very rational. I don't think we see any one, really at any size of organization, doing something that looks unreasonable. So that certainly helps. And I do think that we have a bit of a unique customer base because of the Fair Play strategy and what we've done from a satisfaction and loyalty perspective. We've long-tenured customers on the consumer side, in particular. And I do believe that's certainly going to help us from a pricing and retention perspective going forward. And I think those things really contribute to the fact that we can manage our costs perhaps a little bit better than the average regional bank. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Unidentified Analyst : This is Brandon [ph] on behalf of Erika. So two quick questions. And the first question, sorry to be the dead horse, I just want to understand the expenses. So if we plug in the $40 million, are you basically saying that the quarter-over-quarter growth in expenses on a core basis should be around 3%. And then if we back out that $40 million, it kind of gets to the negative 2.5% for the year? Howell McCullough : So think about it on a full year basis. That's the guidance that we've given. And just make sure you adjust for the $40 million in doing the math. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. And then, separately, I know you guys have previously said that for every 25 basis point increase in rates, you guys should see about $25 million in annual net interest income growth. Is that still intact? Or do you guys see some pressure on the loan side that is compressing spreads? Howell McCullough : Yes, I would say that has reduced a little bit. It's probably around $20 million now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Terence McEvoy : Just the growth in the RV and marine finance portfolio up $800 million year-over-year. Could you just talk about how much of that is out of footprint? And what you're doing internally to manage the risk within that portfolio? Howell McCullough : Yes, Terry, so the growth is -- we're now in 34 states. So the growth is going to be dispersed. Early on, obviously, it was majority in footprint, I would say. Now, we've got greater diversification. The important thing is the profile of the customer, which is identical in all of our markets. You'll note that we're at about an 800 FICO score in that business, so very low probability of default. And we do underwrite this business individually. We're looking at liquidity, we're looking at other measurements, they're not auto decisions. Average size of the boats and RVs are modest, tend to be second time buyers of these assets. So very consistent origination metrics regardless of geography, and, frankly, we like the geographic diversification. Terence McEvoy : And then just as a follow-up, could you maybe discuss reserve building going forward relative to loans? It's been up -- taking up 1 basis point or 2 each quarter. And just going back to your comments on the credit cycle, do you expect that bill to accelerate from here just based on some of those earlier comments? Howell McCullough : We've said that we expect the reserve to build very gradually over time. I think we've been consistent on that going back many quarters. And I think that obviously the components of that bills have been charge-offs, the growths in the portfolio, which has been fairly strong, the marked amortization, and then we've got portfolio specifics, market dynamics, things like that built in. So I would see a fairly consistent view with a slow built going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Kevin Reevey : So could you walk us through the thinking as far as how you decide which branches to consolidate? Stephen Steinour : Kevin, there's a lot of work that goes into this. It's coordinated amongst multiple teams, but it's keyed off of usage patterns within the branches. And so we have #1 branch share in Ohio and Michigan. So we have a density in many of our markets to work from. And those utilization patterns are looked at with a view of not just physical, but also what's going on, on a digital and ATM usage. So we have a fair amount of our distribution that's fairly close in to other branches, and those patterns help us or guide us in terms of where we see opportunities. Kevin Reevey : And then earlier in your -- and Steve, earlier in your prepared remark, you talked about the strength and your bullish outlook on your markets, but I'm just curious just how your ag dependent markets are faring? Stephen Steinour : Well, we're not by any stretch a meaningful ag lender. And while the states of Ohio, Illinois, to some extent Michigan are ag, they're very diversified ag states. They will have some impact from the tariffs. But there is also a fair amount of relief coming to that sector. And the ag sector has had a very robust run for a number of years. Typically, these are individuals or companies that are very, very low leveraged, and so they don't see a significant impact on any of the states we're in, in terms of ag in the near term at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Unidentified Analyst : This is Adele Lee [ph] in for Peter Winter today. I just have a quick question. Could you provide some color around your fee income expectations for the fourth quarter? I mean, given all your continuous tech spend, I would like to see some very exciting things happening there. Howell McCullough : So I think you're going to see growth in the areas that we've experienced the growth year-to-date. I think capital markets will continue to have a good year and a good fourth quarter. I think, going to continue to see growth in card and payment processing revenue, with the growth in households that we see on the consumer side of the bank, good growth in deposit service charges as well on both consumer and commercial when you think about treasury management and some of the product opportunities we have there. I think weakness will be in mortgage banking as we've seen across the industry and throughout the year. The gain on sale has been lighter this year, and that has impacted that line for the entire year. So in general, I think we're in good shape as we think about some of the lines that are performing well for us. Trust and investment management is another, just with the way the market has been performing so far this year. So I would look at the lines where you've seen growth already this year and think about those lines continuing into the fourth quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Steinour for closing comments. Stephen Steinour : Again, thank you, all, for joining us. Through the first 3 quarters of 2018, we've consistently produced quality earnings and look to continue the momentum into the end of the year. We're building long-term shareholder value with our top quartile financial performance and strong risk management. We have a track record of disciplined execution and delivering on our goals and commitments as you've seen. So we look forward to providing new long-term financial metrics later this quarter. And then finally, as always, we'd like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the seventh largest shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. So thanks for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Mark Muth : Thank you, Brenda, welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we\u2019ll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1 hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We produced very good results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018. For the full year, we reported net income of $1.4 billion, an increase of 17% over 2017, which marks the fourth consecutive year of record net income. Full year earnings per common share were $1.20. Importantly, we achieved all five of our long-term financial goals on a full year GAAP basis in 2018, two years ahead of schedule. We\u2019re especially pleased with our full year efficiency ratio of 57%, a 400 basis point improvement versus the prior year. And this was the result of managing to our sixth straight year of positive operating leverage, an annual goal we began targeting in 2014. Our return on tangible common equity was also very strong at 18%. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to increase our capital return to our shareholders in 2018. Last year marked the eighth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend, which as you know is our second highest capital priority behind support for organic growth. Coupling the increased dividend payout with $939 million of share repurchases during the year, we returned nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders, which represented a total payout ratio of 112% of our 2018 earnings. We believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk discipline will continue to support strong capital distribution with a targeted total payout ratio of 70% to 80% going forward. As briefly outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with the vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns. Our fully year profitability metrics are among the best in the industry. We built sustainable competitive advantage in our key businesses that we believe will deliver top quartile performance in the future. Our franchise continues to perform well on many fronts, allowing us to make investments and capabilities we need to drive consistent organic growth. And we\u2019re focused on driving sustained long-term financial performance for our shareholders. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which we implemented nine years ago. And as a reminder, we reinforced the importance of these risks standards by requiring the top 1,400 officers of the company to comply with holder retirement restrictions on their equity awards. Slide 4 illustrates our previous long-term financial goals. And as I\u2019ve already mentioned, and as you can see in the slide, we successfully achieved each of these five targets on a GAAP as well as an adjusted basis during 2018. We had record revenue of $4.5 billion, a 4% increase over 2017. Our expenses remained well controlled, declining 2% year-over-year on a GAAP basis, and up 3% on an adjusted basis. Our commitment to positive operating leverage coupled with the scale we achieved through the FirstMerit acquisition drove our efficiency ratio down from 64% in 2015, the first full year under the plan to 57% in 2018. And this exemplifies that our strategies are carefully decisioned, well executed and certainly driving impressive results. Our credit metrics remain very strong. Our net charge-off ratio for 2018 remained below our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Loan loss provisions in excess of net charge-offs have now been taken in each of the past six quarters demonstrating our high quality earnings. Our 18% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top performing regional bank. Now Slide 5 provides our new three-year financial targets that are a result of our 2018 strategic plan in process. Through thoughtful investment and disciplined execution, our two previous strategic plans build our capabilities, strengthened our competitive advantages in key businesses and positioned us as an industry leader in customer experience. The new 2018 strategic plan is designed to drive continued improvement in financial performance as well as customer experience. We introduced some details to the 2018 plan at an industry conference in November, the initiatives will build upon momentum from our previous strategic plans and will extend our customer experience advantage across our businesses to improve customer acquisition, reduce customer attrition and deepen relationships with our customers. Further, we planned investments in digital, data and technology enhancements that will bolster our existing capabilities and infrastructure with the goal of making banking intuitive, easier and faster for our customers. Finally, we retained our capital priorities including our 9% to 10% CET1 operating range. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 to review the 2019 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. As we look to the year ahead, we are cognizant of recent market volatility, mixed economic data and changing interest rate outlook. We\u2019re very focused on and closely working with our customers and reacting to their views of the economy. Recall it over the years, we\u2019ve communicated actions that we\u2019ve taken to de-risk our portfolios and strengthen our risk management disciplines. In 2009, we centralized credit risk management rather than delegate it to the regions and this change was to ensure that the bank had standard set of enterprise wide risk management capabilities and appetite as well as credit metrics. We eliminated products that didn\u2019t meet our risk profile such as auto leasing and home equity lines of credit, requiring balloon payments at the end of the draw period. Three years ago, we pulled back on leverage lending and commercial real estate, specifically multi-family, retail and construction. We have remained disciplined in these areas. And as a percentage of capital, all of these have lower exposure today than at 2016 year end. Our consumer lending is targeted to prime plus consumers across all of our consumer loan portfolios. We disclose detailed origination data each quarter. And the slides include annual data for the past nine years. We believe these actions of the past decade, including a consistency of underwriting and detailed metrics that we disclose to you every quarter, have prepared us well, to perform well across economic cycles, what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is positive. Businesses in our local markets generally continue to deliver good performance. The strong C&I activity in the fourth quarter suggest the businesses are investing in capital expenditures and business expansions. Uniformly, we hear our customers that their biggest issue is the tight labor markets constraining economic growth in a period, where we already have strong GDP growth. The Midwest has had the highest job opening rate in the nation for the last two years. And some of these businesses have weathered the headwinds of ongoing tariff and trade disputes. Further, consumers also remain upbeat with strong labor markets, driving wage inflation. Consumer confidence in the Midwest was the second highest level in December in nearly two decades, and was also higher than the nation as a whole. Additionally, in the 12 months ending November, 19 of our 20 largest footprint MSAs saw employment growth and unemployment rates remain at historic low levels. So I\u2019d summarize by saying that we\u2019re bullish on our footprint and our customers. We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 6%. Full year average deposit growth is also expected to be 4% to 6% as we remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening core deposit relationships. In light of recent market volatility, the flattening of the yield curve as well as the softer tone coming from the Federal Reserve. We have removed the assumption of two additional rate hikes in our 2019 forecast. We are now utilizing the same unchanged rates scenario that has been part of our annual plan for the last several years. And given that change in modeling assumptions, we now expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 7%. Full year NIM is expected to remain relatively flat on a GAAP basis versus 2018 as modest core NIM expansion offsets the anticipated reduction in the benefit of purchase accounting. With the change in revenue outlook, we\u2019ve paced our planned investments for 2019. We now expect a 2% to 4% increase in non-interest expense consistent with our stated priorities. We continue to target annual positive operating leverage in 2019. We anticipate the net charge-offs will remain below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectation for the full year 2019 effective tax rate is in the 15.5% to 16% range. So with that, Mac, I\u2019ll turn it over to you to provide an overview to financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides the highlights for the full year 2018. Steve mentioned, we are very pleased with our 2018 results. We reported earnings per common share of $1.20, up 20% compared to 2017. We continue to see solid growth in core customer relationships and disciplined execution of our business models driving full year revenue growth of 4%, a 2% decline in non-interest expense, 6% average loan and lease growth and 5% core deposit growth. Our full year efficiency ratio was 57%. Return on assets was 1.3%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 18%. We believe all three of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. Tangible book value per share increased 5% year-over-year to $7.34 even with the increased dividend and substantial share repurchases during the year. Slide 8 provides similar financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Please note that comparisons the year ago quarter are impacted by the $123 million tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to Federal Tax Reform. We posted record quarterly revenue of $1.2 billion, up 4% versus the year ago quarter. As we continue to see momentum build across the franchise. We reported earnings per common share of $0.29, down 22% year-over-year. Excluding the $123 million tax benefit in the year ago quarter, earnings per common share were up $0.03 or 12% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Return on assets was 1.3%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17%. We saw net interest margin expansion of 11 basis points to 3.41% compared to the 2017 fourth quarter, as a result of disciplined asset and deposit pricing and the benefit of interest rate increases partially offset by the run-off of purchase accounting accretion. Turning now to Slide 9, we had very good balance sheet growth during the fourth quarter, as average earning assets grew 4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by a 7% growth in average loans and leases, which include a broad-based strength in both consumer and commercial portfolios. Average residential mortgage loans increased 20% year-every-year, reflecting an increase in loan officers as well as the expansion into the Chicago market. As we typically do, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.  Average C&I loans increased 8% year-over-year with 10% linked quarter annualized, reflecting the ongoing strength we are seeing in the Midwest economy. We once again saw heavy C&I activity during the final weeks of the year, centered in middle market, asset finance and corporate banking. Average auto loans increased 4% year-over-year as a result of consistent disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion down 9% year-over-year. As we have previously mentioned, we\u2019re \u2013 we executed a pricing strategy during the second half of the year to optimize revenue. We consistently increased auto loan pricing throughout 2018 with new money yields on our auto originations averaging 4.60% during the fourth quarter up 109 basis points from the year ago quarter. Average RV and marine loans increased 34% year-over-year, reflecting the success of our well-managed expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two years. Average commercial real estate loans were down 4% on a year-over-year basis and down 3% on a linked quarter basis. This reflects anticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending, as Steve mentioned earlier to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Finally, securities were down 7% year-over-year, as we left the portfolio run-off and utilize the cash flows to fund higher yielding loans during 2018. Turning now to Slide 10. Average total deposits grew 7% year-over-year, including a 7% increase in average core deposits. Core certificates of deposits were up 193% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting consumer deposit growth initiatives during the first three quarters of 2018. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 6%. We can seem to see our commercial customers shift balances from noninterest-bearing DDA to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market. However, as shown on Slide 38 in the appendix, our consumer noninterest-bearing deposits actually increased 5% year-over-year as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships. Average money market deposits were up 4% year-over-year, driven by solid growth in consumer balances and changing preferences of commercial customers shifting to the higher yielding products. As you can see in the bottom left of the page, our percentage of core deposit funding has increased three quarters in a row. Our focus on core funding resulted in a 65% year-over-year reduction in average short-term borrowings. Moving now to Slide 11. Our net interest income increased $59 million or 8% versus the year ago quarter. Driving this growth was the 4% increase in average earning assets, higher yields, in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios and disciplined deposit pricing. Our GAAP net interest margin was 3.41% for the fourth quarter, up 11 basis points from the year ago quarter and up nine basis points linked quarter. Moving to Slide 12. Our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3.34%, up 14 basis points from the year ago quarter, and up nine basis points linked quarter. Both the GAAP and core NIMs in the fourth quarter benefited from two basis points of higher than normal commercial interest recoveries. Purchase accounting accretion contributed seven basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to 10 basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 34 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2018 through 2020. As you will see, purchase accounting accretion is becoming less and less material to the net interest margin and certainly the bottom line when all of the income statement components of purchase accounting are considered together. Fed: Turning to earning asset yields. Our commercial loan yields increased 71 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 36 basis points. Our deposit cost remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 84 basis points for the quarter up 47 basis points year-over-year. Consumer core deposit costs were up 36 basis points year-over- year and commercial core deposits were up 30 basis points. Moving now to Slide 13. Our cycle-to-date beta \u2013 deposit beta remains low at 30% through the fourth quarter of 2018, which is still well below our expectations. We have been communicating that we believe our consumer core CD strategies initiated at the beginning of 2018 will serve us well over time and you can see that beginning to happen here on the slide. This quarter we saw only a 2% increase in our cumulative beta, while the peer group increased 4%. As we have mentioned the last couple of quarters, overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets.  Slide 14 provides detail on our non-interest income for the quarter and comparisons to the year ago quarter. Our non-interest income decreased $11 million or 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017. This decline was primarily driven by $19 million of securities losses resulting from 2018 fourth quarter portfolio repositioning. Earlier in the quarter, we remixed approximately $1.1 billion of securities with an incremental yield pickup of almost 120 basis points by modestly extending duration and without taking additional credit risk. The restructuring of the portfolio was completed in the first half of the fourth quarter and added approximately $3 million of incremental quarterly run rate for the revenue line. We are seeing positive momentum in our three largest contributors to fee income as deposit service charges, cards and payments processing fees and trust and investment management fees were all higher year-over-year. Further, we continue to see strong momentum in our capital markets business as demonstrated by a 26% increase versus the year-ago quarter. The acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey and Erley contributed $4 million of capital market fees during the quarter. Mortgage banking income was down $11 million driven by pressure on secondary marketing spreads. Slide 15 highlights the components of the $78 million or 12% year-over-year growth in expenses. Expenses related to branch and facility consolidations totaled $35 million including $28 million in net occupancy expense and $7 million of equipment expense. results also included almost $4 million of expense related to the closing of the HSE acquisition and the announcement of the divestiture of our Wisconsin retail branch network. As we execute on our new strategic plan, we have not lost sight of the need to control expenses in a more uncertain economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on driving positive operating leverage while making disciplined investments in our colleagues and businesses. Slide 16 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios, tangible common equity into the quarter at 7.21%, down 13 basis points year-over-year, and four basis points linked quarter. common equity in tier one ended the quarter at 9.65%, down 34 basis points year-over-year and 24 basis points linked quarter. These declines were driven by balance sheet growth and accelerated share repurchase activity. We will continue to manage CET1 with our \u2013 within our 9% to 10% operating guideline with a bias towards the upper end of the range. Slide 17 illustrates our previously articulated capital priorities. First, fund organic growth; second, support the cash dividend; and finally, everything else including share repurchases and selective M&A. Our strong capital management and profitability allowed us to execute on these priorities accordingly in 2018. first, we grew full-year average loans by 6% year-over-year while maintaining consistent underwriting discipline. During 2018, we increased the common dividend by 43% to $0.50 per share for the full year. Our end of year dividend yield was 4.7%, the highest in the peer group. Finally, we repurchased $939 million of common stock during the year. Recall that in the 2018 first quarter, we converted $363 million of our Series A preferred stock to common shares. This set us up well going into the 2018 CCAR planning process and allowed us to submit a request that would result of in a full-year total payout ratio above 100%. We have previously stated that we have a long-term payout ratio target of 70% to 80% and a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 45%. during the fourth quarter, we received no objection from the Federal Reserve to our proposal to adjust the path of common stock repurchases. This allowed us to pull forward repurchases from 2019 in the end of the fourth quarter in order to take advantage of market volatility. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased $200 million of common shares at an average cost of $13.36 per share. We have $177 million of share repurchase capacity remaining under a 2018 CCAR capital plan. Moving on to Slide 18, credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of $61 million in the fourth quarter and net charge-offs of $50 million. The loan loss provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong loan growth that we saw. We have now booked loan loss provision expense above net charge-offs for 12 of the 13 quarters illustrating our high-quality earnings. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 27 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were up 11 basis points from the prior quarter and up three basis points from the year-ago quarter. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans decreased one basis point linked quarter to 1.03% while the non-performing asset ratio came down three basis points to 0.52%. Slide 19 highlights Huntington\u2019s strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pre-tax, preprovision net revenue as a result of focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to support balance sheet growth and return capital to our shareholders and advantage rate over the long-term. At the top right, chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and commercial bank, and believe that the diversification of the balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management. We consistently rank in the top four commercial banks in the severely adverse scenario DFAST. Finally, at the bottom right, demonstrates Huntington\u2019s strong capital position. Let me turn it back over to mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Thanks, Mac. Brenda, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up and if that person has additional questions, he or she can then add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Scott Siefers : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Mac, I was hoping you could expand a little on your thoughts on how the core margin kind of trajects throughout the course of the year. I think I\u2019ve done math correctly, in other words, there was the couple of basis points of benefit from interest recoveries in the fourth quarter, but the full-year guide looks like it would imply kind of flat to down from here despite some of the balance sheet restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. So, I\u2019m just curious \u2013 I mean that would be of course, understandable given the environment, but just curious how you see things playing out from where you sit? Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks, Scott. So the guidance that we\u2019re giving as we move to an unchanged rate curve is very consistent with the guidance that we\u2019ve given historically over the past few years, as we\u2019ve used the unchanged rate curve to build our budget. So, basically, you capture the two basis points of \u2013 I would say over normal interest recoveries in the fourth quarter. So, you have to adjust for that as a starting point. And then we\u2019ll actually lose three basis points in full-year 2019 related to a purchase accounting accretion, it\u2019s about four basis points additive to the 2019 margin versus seven basis points to the 2018 margin. So from there, I think it\u2019s just a matter of taking a look at the core NIM and believing that that\u2019s going to increase modestly, we\u2019ve talked about a basis point or two, I would say for the full year, we\u2019re likely looking for a three or four basis point increase and that is driven both by the fact that we took the two rate that increases out of the forecast and also the shape of the curve. It\u2019s much flatter than \u2013 when we\u2019ve done this historically and that also impacted the guidance for the NIM in 2019. So, those are the components that bringing all together. So again, kind of a flat reported NIM and modestly improving core NIM. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you. And then I guess just as we look at the overall revenue growth guide I guess, it\u2019s going to be driven relatively a little more by fee income as opposed to NII this year. And I know you have the benefit of the acquisition from second half of last year. But as you look out through the year main drivers of that fee momentum as you see them. Mac McCullough : We have really good momentum in capital markets as I mentioned in the script and we also see continued good improvements in deposit service charges that we continue to build households very impressively. We also see good performance in the card and payments line, and also in trust and investment management fees. So, we see good performance across those four categories, partially offset by what we see in mortgage banking in this quarter, but certainly, we have really good momentum in those other lines. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right, great. Thank you very much. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, Mac. Mac McCullough : Hey, Ken. Ken Usdin : So in fourth quarter, NIM was 3.41% with the two interest recoveries, that\u2019s 3.39%. So, can you just explain sequentially, I\u2019m not sure I understand the magnitude of a six-basis point drop and then staying there for the rest of the year, especially with the help you just mentioned from the portfolio purchase knowing that there is the accretion run-off. So can you help us a little bit more understand just the step down and \u2013 because I don\u2019t \u2013 I get the moving parts of among the positive versus the negative, but the delta from that kind of underlying, can you help us understand what drives such a big step down? Mac McCullough : Yes. So can I \u2013 I do think a portion of it is going to be based on what we\u2019re assuming around will be the shape of the curve in 2019. There is incremental impact from that based on what we\u2019ve modeled for the budget in the forecast in 2019. We could also have some deposit cost maybe front-loaded into the first and second quarters. As we continue to see good momentum and good flow of deposits across both commercial and consumer, we just want to make sure that we keep that momentum going. We\u2019ve done a good job in reducing our short-term borrowings and we want to continue to stay in that position. So I think at this point, just thinking about the full year and thinking about the core NIM increasing three to four basis points is the way to think about it, there could be some conservatism built in this, but it all comes down to what we\u2019re assuming around the rate environment and also how we\u2019re thinking about liability cost and what we want to do to stay core funded. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the full-year guide, then in your total revenue guide, which I always understand is on a \u2013 it\u2019s GAAP, but inclusive of the FTE. Do you include anything either on a gain from the branch sales or also the effect of removing that business from the total revenue base? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes. So we certainly have impact when you think about the 70 branch consolidations and you think about the sale of the Wisconsin branches. There\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s revenue impact from that and most of that is going to come in the form of net interest income. So we have factored those impacts into 2019. And you\u2019re right, we look at it on an FTE basis, but there really are no other adjustments in 2019 to speak up. Ken Usdin : Okay. Mac McCullough : Okay? Ken Usdin : Yes. So there is no gain baked into that as well? Mac McCullough : Yes, there is no gain on sale baked into any of these numbers for 2019. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay. Thank you, Mac. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Ken Zerbe : Great Thanks. Mac McCullough : Hey, Ken. Ken Zerbe : Sorry to ask another question on margin. I just want to be really quick is that is a pretty steep drop that you guys are building in on a core basis. So, if we go from the 3.41%, 3.39% excluding two basis points, I get it. You say that your deposit cost is going be front-loaded. I mean, are we looking at a meaningful step down in first quarter specifically or to get your full-year guidance, is it more of just this gradual reduction over the course of the year? Mac McCullough : Yes, it would definitely be a gradual reduction over the course of the year and that would be primarily the report as the core NIM even adjusting for the two basis points in the fourth quarter, I would say over normal interest recoveries. You could see a step-up in the first quarter in the core NIM. So, it really is the impact of purchase accounting and the impact of the interest recoveries that would be impacting the reported NIM. So, we\u2019re not talking about huge changes here and either, we\u2019re talking about basis points, but that should help to explain some of that drop fourth quarter to first quarter. Ken Zerbe : Got you. It does, it does. So then by the end of the year, maybe your \u2013 I mean I pick a number, plus cost 3.30% is your sort of reported NIM heading into 2020. That seems like the right way to think about it. Mac McCullough : Yes, that\u2019s not unreasonable. Ken Zerbe : Got it. Okay. And then sorry, there might sort of follow-up question, if you will. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re doing specifically to help reduce your asset sensitive position and how much is that dollar impact in terms of your NII? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes. So what we\u2019re looking at right now would be out of the money interest rate floors. You might see us also add some additional investment securities to reduce some of that asset sensitivity. Overall, we think that there is a slight cost to the out of money interest rate floors, but not significant in the scheme of things based upon the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now. But we\u2019re continuing to evaluate that position based on how 2019 unfolds. You could see us further reduce that asset sensitivity position, but we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned right now and the actions that we\u2019re taking. Ken Zerbe : All right. Perfect. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Steve Steinour : Good morning, John. Mac McCullough : Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. On your long-term goals, just seems like you maintained your long-term revenue target of 4% to 6% despite removing the Fed hikes from your 2019 assumptions and assuming a flatter curve and everything, and I\u2019m assuming dialing in some of this hedging plans and everything. So does that mean in terms of long-term revenue expectation you can come in at the lower end of that 4% to 6%? Or do you still have a high degree of confidence in the attainability of the mid or higher end? Mac McCullough : Yes, John, its Mac. So we feel comfortable with the range that we\u2019ve put out. When we put a range out like this, we typically earn that at the low-end or at the high-end and we have \u2013 we probably do have some conservatism built into 2019 from a revenue perspective as we think about this. But feel very comfortable with the 4% to 7% range we put out there for revenue. We did bring it down, it was 5% to 8% that we disclosed in November at an industry conference. So that certainly would reflect the impact that we see from the rate increases coming out of the forecast. But I would tell you that from a fundamental balance sheet growth fee income perspective, we really haven\u2019t made any changes to what we see based upon what Steve talked about the strength of the Midwest economy and what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. We also did take the expense guidance down by a 1% on either end just recognizing the fact that in this environment we\u2019ve got to manage the expense to fit the revenue outlook and continue to drive the positive operating leverage. So we feel very comfortable with the ranges that we put out and, again, the revenue impact is entirely due to the change in the rate outlook. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, thanks. And then separately I just want to ask around credit for the \u2013 I just wanted if you can get a little bit more color on the $20 million \u2013 $21 million increase in charge-offs, I know you indicated that at C&I, just want to see if you have any more color there that you can give us what type of industries and if there\u2019s any kind of leverage lending in there? And then separately, your 30 to 89 day delinquencies in C&I increase, it looks like 43%, so the ratio went from 19 to 26 bps, not a big jump in the ratio, but still pretty big jump dollar wise. So want to get some color there? Thanks. Steve Steinour : Sure. So just in terms of the charge-offs. I think it\u2019s important to obviously point out that we\u2019re operating at a very low level. So in the entire C&I book in the last year, I think we took $15 million of total charge-offs that\u2019s commercial and commercial real estate. So just to kind of level set there, last quarter, we actually had net recoveries in the entire commercial book. So in terms of concentrations, there certainly aren\u2019t any because the numbers are so low. We had no charge-off in the last quarter larger than $4 million. We had one for $3 million, one for $2 million. They are all in different industries. There were no leverage lending, no leveraged loans in that population. So \u2013 and if you look year-over-year in terms of our charge-offs that\u2019s there they are very consistent, 24 basis points to 27 and that\u2019s largely due to the fact that fourth quarter the consumer loans are generally, you\u2019ll see delinquencies and charge-offs bump up. So we \u2013 so from that standpoint, I think that\u2019s the story on the charge-offs. And then on the delinquencies, commercial delinquencies are you can have a single deal that moves the numbers may hit over or over 30 days and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got going on here. That\u2019s not the indicator of any trend there, so no concerns at all. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush. Peter Winter : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : I wanted to ask about mortgage banking. Obviously given the market conditions under a lot of pressure. But should we think about the fourth quarter being close to bottoming here? Mac McCullough : So, Peter, it\u2019s really going to depend on where we end up with the secondary marketing, that\u2019s been the pressure point for the entire year. We\u2019ve actually performed well from a volume perspective as we\u2019ve added mortgage originators in the Chicago market at \u2013 performing at a very high level. And we\u2019ve also, I would say upgraded talent across the franchise from a mortgage perspective. So feel very comfortable with the health of the business we completed a in-depth analysis for the business in 2018 and feel very comfortable with our position and how we\u2019re managing that business. But it just depends on where we go from secondary marketing from here. Peter Winter : Okay. And then Mac, if I could just follow-up on your comments about the securities portfolio. In 2018, you kind of ran it off as \u2013 partly, I guess as of funding for loan growth and then you said you might actually add to securities to reduce the asset sensitivity? Mac McCullough : Yes. Peter Winter : Can you just talk about what the \u2013 so we should expect 2019 to see that portfolio actually grow a little bit and more reliance on core deposits just the way to think about it. Mac McCullough : Yes. Peter, so we are going to start to reinvest cash flow in 2019 back into the portfolio as well as maybe get a little bit more aggressive in building the portfolio if we decide that\u2019s the best action to manage our asset sensitivity. So we did let the portfolio run down in 2018, we did replace those assets with resi mortgage that we kept on the balance sheet to a certain extent. But you\u2019ll start to see us grow that portfolio in 2019 and the degree to which we use that as a hedge against asset sensitivity is still under consideration, but you could see that. Peter Winter : Thanks, Mac. Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks, Peter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Morning. Steve Steinour : Hi, Marty. Mac McCullough : Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby : I had two questions. One is, Mac, when we look at this net interest margin, I don\u2019t want to go back to the details of that, we\u2019ve hammer that pretty hard. What I want to do is combine that with the other side, which is, you\u2019ve been building your allowance coverage as this PAA is being recognized. So it\u2019s kind of just a natural shift between kind of the PAA that\u2019s over there and then also and it comes out it and becomes a regular loan and then you put it back into the build. So there is kind of a natural offset. You\u2019ve had $20 million of average build in your allowance through each quarter in 2018. So just wondering, because a lot of the margin compression that\u2019s really kind of getting communicated here is the purchase accounting accretion, so is there a natural offset, you just don\u2019t have to build as much in your allowance that helps to compensate for some of that impact. Mac McCullough : Yes, Marty. I think we lay that up pretty well on Slide 34 in the deck, where you can see that, for 2019, we\u2019re anticipating that the overall impact of purchase accounting is actually a loss or minus $8 million for full year 2019. So we are seeing the first accounting accretion come down, we\u2019re seeing what we need to add to the allowance for the FirstMerit portfolio to come down since we\u2019re cycling through that. We still have a bit to go. But as you can see on Slide 34, we still anticipate some provision expense related to FirstMerit in 2019. So I think this slide does layout how all these things play together and the impact on the bottom line, but clearly PAA is becoming less material and we\u2019ll have less of an impact on the margin in 2019, but certainly still does have that impact. Marty Mosby : And just the build also kind of comes down I guess as well, the need to build for the FirstMerit is less, there\u2019s still some because there\u2019s still some PAA, but it\u2019s less than what it was in 2018. Mac McCullough : That would be absolutely correct. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then Steve, you kind of threw something in there early on about this almost like a vesting till retirement for equity positions of members of your team. Just was curious about how you envision that, why you chose to highlighted and how you think that affects culture in a way that the employees kind of look at equity ownership? Steve Steinour : So Marty, we may not have been totally clear in the past, but we made this change in 2010 and we put percentage of equity granted, net of tax into a hold to retirement requirement for colleagues and overtime its accumulated to where we have 1,400 colleagues in some position with a hold to retirement and it gets track, these are shares that are segregated in a separate account with the third-party. And we believe what we did it and continue to believe that it aligns the management of the company with our shareholders\u2019 interests. And I think we\u2019ve seen over time a greater focus on risk management across the board, but especially in credit with it \u2013 throughout the company as a consequence. So there\u2019s definitely skin in the game as a result of this and we \u2013 2009, we as a group were not a top 100 shareholder, today with generally the seventh largest shareholder with the growing position off of equity grants made every year. So fundamental change in philosophy going back to 2010 by the board and very supportive in making the change we recommended to make sure that there is complete alignment between management and shareholders overtime and through cycles. Is that answers your question? Marty Mosby : It did and it was not a 100%, but there\u2019s a portion or amount that\u2019s actually set aside, that would be vested at retirement. Steve Steinour : Its 25% to 50% of equity granted net of taxes and there is no ceiling. So it compounds. Marty Mosby : No, that\u2019s great as an industrially angle and not \u2013 so all that\u2019s that about the seventh holder of shareholder I thought that was very impactful and interesting. So thanks. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lana Chan with BMO. Lana Chan : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hey, Lana. Mac McCullough : Good morning. Lana Chan : I just \u2013 first question about what you\u2019re seeing with competition. It seems like there is some new bigger banks moving into some of your markets and also any comments about non-bank competition any changes in the recent quarter? Steve Steinour : Lana, this is Steve. We monitor through a number of different data points impacts of non-bank competition is remains very, very muted and essentially no change quarter-to-quarter from what we can see. And then separately, we have some banks, larger banks expanding into the footprint. But we have a lot of large banks already here. So the old bank, one presence here in Columbus, JPM Chase is very, very large in Columbus in terms of employees. We see BBVA in Michigan. So there is a presence from the large banks already and we\u2019ve \u2013 through our strategies and focus, we have managed to compete okay or adequately and somewhat successfully over time. We\u2019d expect to continue to do that. But recognize that there are some targeted investments in the Midwest. Actually, we view that as a positive in some sense. The Midwest was clearly a disinvestment region for years and years and it\u2019s an affirmation of what\u2019s going on in the economy here to show \u2013 to see that recent focus. Lana Chan : Okay, thank you. And the second question was around capital. Just wondering the way you look at the CET1 ratio targeting at upper end of the 9% to 10% range. Is there also a binding constraint on that in terms of \u2013 sort of the old school capital ratios that we used to look at prior to the financial crisis the TCE to TA ratio? Mac McCullough : Yes, Lana, we do take a look at tangible common equity quite carefully and we do monitor that ratio relative to CET1. CET1 is our primary constraint as we think about the CCAR process and what we\u2019ve set goals around. And we do have a bit of a larger gap between TCE and CET1 because of the size of our investment security portfolio and the makeup of that investment security portfolio. So at this level, we\u2019re comfortable with TCE, but CET1 is the measure that we basically measure and go against. Lana Chan : Okay. Thanks, Mac. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Jon Arfstrom : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Steve, maybe a quick one for you. It sounds like you\u2019re optimistic lending in the economy, but just \u2013 and you talk about the labor issue, I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re hearing anything new that causes you any concerns? Or anything from your customers that might be a little bit different than what you\u2019ve heard in previous quarters? Steve Steinour : Jon, we\u2019ve done more outreach in the last 60 days or so than at any time since I\u2019ve been here. The customer has to get a sense of what their plans are and the impacts of the market volatility and at least at this point, it is very, very benign. There are some companies impacted both ways on the tariffs as we\u2019d expect, but the market volatility has not impacted at this point in any material way outlook. So there is a continued expectation of growth, maybe these companies have backlogs or pipelines that are committed. And I think I shared in the last call, we get contractors and others with long lead times that are well out into next year was with the group that\u2019s \u2013 has commitments to 2020, 2021. In fact, so it\u2019s getting extended, again, this tightness of labor is benefiting, so the competitive dynamics in some of these industries, the fact that they can just deliver is giving them a locked in opportunity of a longer duration that they\u2019ve seen. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. Thank you, that helps. And then a question on the expense guidance in terms of the change in expense growth by basically by taking rates out of your revenue side. Can you give us some \u2013 these aren\u2019t big numbers, but can you give us an idea of the types of projects you might delay a bit and if we do get a couple of more hikes, does that change your spending plans again and where would that money go? Steve Steinour : Sure. Jon, we have a fair amount of reinvestment coming off of the branch consolidations that are completed and were completed around the end of the year and the sale of Wisconsin. And so we\u2019re self-funding a fair amount of investment in digital, data and other technology. In addition to building out a number of our revenue groups and so you\u2019ll see expansions in business banking, commercial banking, some of our fee businesses on the private banking side and the capital markets in particular. We\u2019ll pace the rate of investment and we\u2019ve talked about this in prior quarterly calls and an analyst sessions, we\u2019ll pace the rate of investment to match the expected revenue, it was not like we\u2019re going to walk away from these. This is just a pacing thing. So if interest rates come our way or for other \u2013 with other reasons where we\u2019re generating revenue add or beyond the high-end level of that range, we would look to accelerate some of the investments, but we\u2019ll continue to manage it, we\u2019ll pace it or moderate it as we see the economy in the outlook. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, all right. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Barker : Good morning. I just want to follow-up, you mentioned the capital markets pipeline was really strong . You had a really good quarter, fourth quarter and it could be some seasonality in there, but when you look into 2019, where do you see the run rate from the $29 million you have today expected to come down in the first half and then accelerate in the back half. Just give us some color on the capital market side? Mac McCullough : So Kevin, its Mac. So it will be, it\u2019s usually a little bit slower in the first quarter, but we do expect capital markets revenue to increase as the year progresses. We\u2019ve made some, I think some smart investments into that business and really executing at a very high level when it comes to the people we have on that team and how they interact and support of lending groups. Steve Steinour : Well the pipelines as we enter the year are consistent with third, fourth quarter sort of pipeline. So we have reasonable volumes that we\u2019re expecting over the first half of the year from the pipeline and a lot of that C&I, again, our capital markets activity is customer focused. And \u2013 so the carry \u2013 the continued strength of the pipeline gives us some confidence as we move forward in addition to the investments and additional capabilities. Kevin Barker : And then the follow-up on the expense side, you had the $28 million you called out in the branch consolidation and $7 million in equipment. So we assume the run rate associated with occupancy and equipment to be significantly lower going into 2019 and then the 2% to 4% expense growth on a GAAP basis will be primarily due to investments, maybe in salaries or other portions of the business. Mac McCullough : Yes, Kevin, I think that\u2019s the right way to take a look at it, we\u2019ll definitely see reduced run rates related to the facilities actions that we\u2019ve taken in the fourth quarter branches and kind of corporate facilities. And Steve mentioned some of the investments that we\u2019re doing as we think about the expenses that we took out related to Wisconsin or the 70 branch consolidation. So we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re investing in 2019 and it would be in a typical lines you would expect to see it, personnel and certainly anything that relates to technology development. So those are the areas that I would look for growth, but beyond that, I would say nothing out of the ordinary. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was just wondering from a strategic point of view, any further bolt-on whether its deals or divestitures? And then obviously you\u2019re not going to tell us accurately what you do, but just thoughts on if there is further tinkering to the franchise and then of course, some \u2013 as you think longer term strategic opportunities that might be bigger that could be interesting? Mac McCullough : So, Matt, we\u2019re always looking at opportunities and I will tell you that what we\u2019re focused on is probably less around core banking franchises, as we\u2019ve talked about historically and maybe more focused on things like HSE or Macquarie Equipment Finance. So, I think that we haven\u2019t stopped in terms of what we\u2019re looking at from an M&A perspective, but we\u2019re very comfortable with the businesses that we have and it\u2019s not that we\u2019re out looking for something in particular, but anything we can find like an HSE or Macquarie that helps to strengthen our position in businesses that we\u2019re already in, bring us additional capabilities and talent. Those are very attractive opportunities that we think we\u2019ve acquired at a very attractive price. So like I said, we\u2019re always looking, but in this market, I wouldn\u2019t expect that we\u2019re going to be doing a lot if anything. Steve Steinour : We think, we can improve the core performance as you\u2019ve seen in the long-term financial metrics that as well. And so that\u2019s the focus drive the core. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then just thoughts on maybe something bigger that will get you more scale, do you feel like you need more scale as we look out kind of more medium to long-term? Mac McCullough : So we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned right now. I think the FirstMerit transaction was extremely beneficial to us from a scale perspective. Steve pointed out, the improvement in the efficiency ratio earlier in this call. We\u2019ve been pretty direct in the saying that at this point in the cycle and based upon valuations and expectations, it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019re going to be doing a core deposit franchise at this point in the cycle. So very, very unlikely math and like I said, we\u2019re focused on some of the specialty things that are few and far between, but good opportunities when we can find them. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you. Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Steve Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : 2018 was highlighted by the achievement for the first time of all five of our long-term financial goals implemented with the 2014 strategic plan on a GAAP basis. We\u2019re really pleased with that. The focused execution of our strategic initiatives over the years spill the company that we believe will produce consistent high-quality earnings and attractive returns to our shareholders. 2019 commences the first year of the new three-year strategic plan. We\u2019ve raised the bar for ourselves once again, as you\u2019ve seen. And while the plan involves important investments in our businesses that will improve our customer experience, the core strategies remain the same. We expect to continue to gain market share and grow share wallet through our differentiated products, distinctive brand and superior customer service. So we see this as a lower risk set of initiatives over the next three years. We look forward to carrying the momentum that we\u2019ve built into 2019 and beyond. And finally, there\u2019s a high level of management alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively the seventh largest shareholder of Huntington and all of us, all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thank you, Donna. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1 hour from the close of today's call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Mark and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a solid start to the year in the first quarter. Reporting net income of $358 million an increase of 10% from the year ago quarter. Earnings per common share were $0.32, up 14% from the year ago quarter. Our profitability ratios remain strong as our return on tangible common equity was 18%, and our return on assets was 1.35%. Average loans increased 6% year-over-year, including a 7% increase in consumer loans and a 5% increase in commercial loans. Average core deposits increased 8% year-over-year, reflecting our attempt to fully fund low growth with core deposits. We're pleased with the first quarter efficiency ratio of less than 56% down from 57% the year ago, driven by a 5% year-over-year revenue growth as well as expense discipline. Overall asset quality remains strong as most credit ratios remain near cyclical lows. As we foreshadowed in our remarks with two conferences during the first quarter, net charge-offs ticked modestly higher this quarter, as a result of two unrelated commercial credits. Still with these two items, net charge-offs were near the low end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. And as we've noted previously, we expect some quarter-to-quarter volatility given the very low loss and problem loan levels at which we're operating. Our ratios for NPAs, delinquencies and criticized loans all remain very good. As briefly outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns. Our first quarter profitability reflects continued progress towards this aspiration. We continue to make thoughtful and meaningful long-term investments in our businesses particularly around customer experience in order to drive organic growth. We also prudently allocate our capital to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risk consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We are very pleased with how we are positioned. We built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe are and will continue to deliver top quartile financial performance in the future. We remain focused on driving sustain long-term financial performance for our shareholders. Slide 4 illustrates our current expectations for the full year 2019 and our new long-term financial goals. We continue to have a very constructive view of the local economies in our footprint, which we expect will translate into continued organic growth this year. What we are hearing from our customers remains positive. Businesses in our local markets generally continued to deliver good performance. While the first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter for commercial lending activity, our commercial pipelines have remained steady. Businesses in our footprint, our investing in capital expenditures and expansions of the tight labor markets continue to constraint economic growth. Our commercial customers continue to tell us that finding employees is their biggest challenge. Some of these businesses have also weathered the headwinds of ongoing tariff and trade disputes. Across our footprint, consumers also remain upbeat with strong labor market striving wage inflation. In the three months ending February 18 of our 20 largest footprint, MSA's saw unemployment rates decline, while the remaining two MSA's were unchanged. Additionally, consumer competence in our region is generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. Job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in most of our markets. So to summarize, we're saying that we remain bullish on the economy in our footprint within our businesses. We do not see signs of a near-term economic downturn, but nonetheless we are cognizant of recent market volatility and mixed economic data, particularly in December and earlier this year, as well as the recent short-lived inversion of the yield curve. As we communicated on the last earnings call, we removed all rate hikes for our forecast and had been taking steps to prepare for a more challenging interest rate outlook. We do not foresee a recession in the near-term. However, our core earnings power, strong capital, aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite and our long-term strategic alignment position us to withstand economic headwinds. Our strategy is designed to drive more consistent performance across economic cycles. Our full year 2019 expectations remain unchanged from what we discussed in the fourth quarter earnings call in January. We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 6%, full year average deposit growth is also expected to be 4% to 6%. As we remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. We expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 7%, the full year NIM is expected to remain relatively flat on a GAAP basis versus 2018, inclusive of the anticipated reduction in the benefits of purchase accounting and the cost of the hedging strategy we began implementing in the first quarter of this year. The full year core NIM is expected to modestly expand. Net interest expense is expected to increase 2% to 4% consistent with our stated priorities. We continue to target annual positive operating leverage in 2019. Now as Mac noted in the conference presentations during the first quarter. We expect our normal seasonal increase in compensation and marketing expenses during the second quarter resolving in a peak quarterly efficiency ratio for the year in the second quarter. We anticipate full year 2019 net charge-offs will remain below our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectations for the full year effective tax rate is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range. So with that, Mac will not provide an overview of our financial performance. Mac, Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the highlights for the 2019 first quarter. Results reflected strong earnings momentum with double digit growth rates in net income and earnings per common share along with continued improvement in our profitability ratios. We recorded net income of $358 million, an increase of 10% versus the year ago quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.32, up 14% year-over-year. Tangible book value per common share was $7.67, an 8% year-over-year increase. Return on assets was 1.3%, return on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 18%. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 55.8% down from 56.8% in the year ago quarter. We saw net interest margin expansion of 9 basis points to 3.39% compared to the 2018 first quarter, as a result of disciplined asset and deposit pricing, and the benefit of interest rate increases partially offset by the concede runoff of purchase accounting accretion. Turning now to Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $3.8 billion or 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Low growth accounted for more than the entire increase as average loans and leases increased $4.3 billion or 6% year-over-year, including a $2.5 billion or 7% increase in consumer loans and a $1.8 billion or 5% increase in commercial loans. Aided by the strong loan production late in the fourth quarter, average commercial and industrial loans grew 8% from the first quarter of 2018 and reflective of the largest component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well diversified over the past year with notable growth in corporate banking, asset finance, dealer floorplan and middle market banking. We're also seeing good early traction in our new specialty lending verticals that we announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan. Alternatively, we can actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average CRE loans reflecting a 6% year-over-year decrease. This reflects anticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending to ensure appropriate returns on capital and to manage risk. Consumer loan growth remains centered in the residential mortgage and RV and marine portfolios reflecting the well managed expansion of these two businesses over the past two years. Average residential mortgage loans increased 18% year-over-year, as we typically do, we sold the agency-qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Average RV and marine loans increased 33% year-over-year. Average auto loans increased 2% year-over-year as a result of consistent disciplined loan production. Originations total $1.2 billion for the first quarter, down 14% year-over-year. As we have previously mentioned, we are executing a pricing strategy to optimize revenue via increased auto loan pricing that has resulted in a lower production volumes, but that is a trade off we like. New money yields on our auto originations averaged 4.73% during the first quarter, up 85 basis points from the year ago quarter. The increase in other earning assets shown on this slide reflects the inclusion of deposit balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. These balances were treated as non-earning assets prior to the fourth quarter of 2018. Finally, securities were down 5% year-over-year, as we let the portfolio runoff and utilize the cash flows to fund higher yielding loans during 2018. During the 2019 first quarter, we began reinvesting portfolio cash flows in new securities driving the linked quarter increase. Turning now to Slide 7. Average total deposits and average core deposits both grew 8% year-over-year. Core certificates of deposit were up 164% from the year ago quarter primarily reflecting the consumer CD growth initiatives during the first three quarters of 2018. Average money market deposit increased 11% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the shift in promotional pricing away from CDs to consumer money market accounts in mid 2018. Average interest bearing DDA deposits increased 6% year-over-year. While average non-interest bearing DDA deposits decreased 3%. As shown on Slide 30 in the appendix, we are very pleased that our consumer non-interest bearing deposits increased 5% year-over-year, as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships. We continue to see our commercial customers shift balances from non-interest bearing DDA to interest bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market. Average savings and other domestic deposits decreased 8%, primarily reflecting the continued shift in consumer product mix, particularly among legacy FirstMerit accounts, as FirstMerit's promotional pricing strategies focused on savings accounts compared to our primary focus on money market. Significantly, our continued focus on core funding resulted in a 56% year-over-year reduction in average short term borrowings. Moving now to Slide 8, FTE net interest income increased $52 million or 7% versus the year ago quarter, driving this growth was the 4% increase in average earning assets raising yields in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios and disciplined deposit pricing. Our GAAP net interest margin was 3.39% for the first quarter, up 9 basis points from the year ago quarter. The net interest margin decreased 2% \u2013 2 basis points linked quarter. Moving to Slide 9, our core net interest margin for the first quarter was 3.33%, up 11 basis points from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 6 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to 8 basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 26 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of the FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020. On a sequential quarter basis, the core NIM compressed 1 basis point equivalent to the linked quarter decline the contribution from purchase accounting accretion. As a reminder, the 2018 fourth quarter both GAAP and core NIMs benefited from 2 basis points of higher than normal commercial interest recoveries. Turning to the earning asset yields, our commercial loan yields increased 65 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 41 basis points. Our deposit costs remain well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 94 basis points for the quarter, up 51 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, our total interest-bearing deposits costs increased 10 basis points. Slide 10 illustrates our cycle-to-date interest-bearing deposit beta compared to peers. Our cumulative deposit beta remains low at 32%. We have been communicating that we believe that consumer core CD strategies, we utilized over the first three quarters of 2018 would serve us well over time, effectively front-loading some of the deposit beta. You can see those benefits over the past two quarters as our cumulative beta has not increased as quickly as our peers. This quarter of the peer group average cumulative beta increased 4%, what we saw 2% increase in our cumulative beta. As we've mentioned in the last couple quarters overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets. Assuming no additional rate increases, our current forecast assumes modest continued upward pressure on deposit cost driven by continued mixed shifts and incremental deposit growth from higher cost products, particularly money market. Slide 11 provides detail on our non-interest income, which increased 2% from the year ago quarter. Gain on sale of loans and leases increased 63% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the gain on the sale of asset finance leases and higher SBA loan sales. Mortgage banking income decreased 19%, primarily reflecting a $3 million loss on net mortgage servicing rights in the quarter and lower origination volume. Capital markets fees were relatively flat year-over-year, but there were few notable items impacting this line. First, during the 2019 first quarter, we recognized $6 million unfavorable commodity derivative mark-to-market adjustment related to a commercial customer. Partially offsetting this, the Hutchinson, Shockey and Erley acquisition which closed in October of 2018 contributed $5 million of capital markets be used during the 2019 first quarter. Finally, when not impacting the comparisons. We moved syndication fees, which were about $3 million in the 2019 first quarter, compared to $2 million in the year ago quarter into this line item. Syndication fees were previously included in other income. While down sequentially, due to normal seasonality, we continue to see positive momentum within our two largest contributors in non-interest income, the deposit service charges and cards and payments processing fees both posted year-over-year growth. We've been executing our new strategic plan for two quarters now and we're thoughtfully investing in our Colleagues and Digital Technology in our brand. Slide 12 highlights the components of the $20 million or 3% year-over-year growth in overhead expense. Personnel costs increased $18 million or 5% accounting for almost the entire increase. This primarily reflective hiring related to our strategic initiatives, the implementation of annual merit increases in the 2018 second quarter and increased benefit cost. We've added colleagues in our digital and technology areas and experienced bankers in our new lending verticals. Major of the increase primarily reflected on $8 million or 11% increase in outside data processing and other services, which was driven by increased technology investments. Deposit and other insurance expense decreased $10 million, or 56% due to the discontinuation of the FDIC surcharge in the 2018 fourth quarter. We remain focused on driving positive operating leverage. As part of our commitments to manage expenses relative to the revenue environment, we self-funded a portion of the expenses related to these new hires and technology investments through the branch rationalization completed at year end 2018, the elimination of the FDIC surcharge and other efficiency improvement efforts. Cost savings from the pending Wisconsin branch divestiture will further fund strategic investments going forward. Looking ahead to the 2019 second quarter, we expect non-interest expense will reflect a linked quarter increase of approximately $40 million to $50 million, resulting in a peak quarterly efficiency ratio of the year, but we're trending down in the back half of the year. Roughly, two-thirds of this expected increase reflects the normal seasonal increase in compensation expense as a result of the annual plans of our long-term incentive compensation in May, as well as the May implementation of annual merit increases. Marketing expense accounts for the majority of the remainder of the expected increase, reflecting the normal timing of spring campaigns and promotions. The magnitude of these increases is consistent with what we've experienced the past two years. However, the seasonal increases were masked in both of those years by noise related to the FirstMerit acquisition and other non-recurring items. Our full year 2019 expense expectations remain unchanged as this is normal seasonality in our expenses and has always been incorporated into our expectations. Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 7.57%, down 13 basis points from year ago, but up 36 basis points from the 2018 year end. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1 ended the quarter at 9.84%, down 61 basis points year-over-year, but up 19 basis points linked quarter. We continue to manage CET1 within our 9% to 10% operating guideline with the basis towards the upper end of the range. We repurchased 60.5 million common shares over the last four quarters. During the 2019 first quarter, we were purchased 1.8 million shares at an average price of $13.64 per share, or a total of $25 million of common stock. There is $152 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the 2018 capital plan. We intend to complete the repurchase of the full $152 million of remaining capacity during the 2019 second quarter. During the first quarter, we submitted our 2019 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. Recent regulatory relief moved Huntington and other regional banks our size from annual to buy annual CCAR participation, resulting in us not being required to participate in the formal CCAR process this year. However, we will participate in CCAR again in 2020. Therefore, we intend to maintain the normal cadence of announcing our annual capital plan and planned capital actions in June. That said, we have previously stated that we are targeting a long-term capital return in the 70% to 80% range in a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 40% to 45%. Our submitted 2019 capital plan is consistent with those targets. We have also previously communicated on many instances that our capital priorities are, first to fund organic growth, second to support the cash dividend and finally all of their capital uses including the buyback and selective acquisitions. Those capital priorities have not changed. Slide 14 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter, which remains strong. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of $63 million in the first quarter and net charge-offs of $71 million. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 38 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 27 basis points the prior quarter and from 21 basis points in the year ago quarter. The increase was centered in two specific commercial credit relationships. Consumer charge-offs remained consistent over the past year. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio and the analyst's package in the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans remained relatively stable at 1.02%, down 1 basis point linked quarter. The non-performing asset ratio increased 9 basis points linked quarter and 2 basis points year-over-year to 61 basis points. The year-over-year increase was centered in the C&I portfolio, partially offset by decreases in the commercial real estate portfolio, residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. There was also a year-over-year increase in other NPAs associated with the investment portfolio. Overall, asset quality metrics remain near cyclical lows and as we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low levels of problem loans. Slide 15 highlights Huntington's strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pretax preprovision net revenue as a result of focused execution on our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to support balance sheet growth and return capital to our shareholders at an advantage rates over the long term. The top right chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and commercial bank and believe that the diversification of the balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management. We consistently rank in the top 4 commercial banks in the severely adverse scenario of DFAST. Finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington's strong capital position. Let me now turn it over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Thanks, Mac. Donna, we will now take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Quick question on the positive way you maintain the NIM guidance for full year flat, you took out the remaining rate hikes as you said, the curves obviously gotten flatter. But in your slide, you still talk about I expected through the cycle 50% beta versus the low-30s you're at now. So can you talk about the goods and bads in terms of your ability to keep that GAAP NIM flat for the year and how you expect that to be a GAAP in quarter to trend from the 3.39% this quarter? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes, thanks Ken. It's Mac. So a few things I'll point out. I mean, we have seen a good noninterest-bearing deposit growth in the consumer line on the balance sheet, which continues to help us keep the NIM at a decent level. But we're also very focused on managing both the asset yields and the liability rates. We're very carefully monitoring the rates that we bring onto the balance sheet on the asset side. And we're also extremely focused on what we're paying on the deposit side as well. So it's a pretty fluid environments and we just are making sure that from a \u2013 both in asset and liability position, we're making good decisions around the rates and yields that we're bringing things on to the balance sheet. We continue to work through some of the headwinds that have been discussed. I mean, clearly purchase accounting accretion is working against us. We do have some additional costs associated with the hedging program, which is probably 3 basis points on the margin for the full year. But we monitor these things very frequently and we continue to take actions to make sure that we continue to support the NIM. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then my follow-up on that point then, so that would just expect that you had mentioned that the core NIM, I think should be up from here or upper year-over-year? So just in terms of the underlying core trend, we know about the purchase accounting, but if you get us help us understand that the core trend from here. Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes. So the core NIM will be up modestly year-over-year. I think, you could expect that it is going to drift a little bit lower on a quarterly basis, but for the year-over-year impact it should be up, probably three to four basis points, something like that. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks, Mac. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mark Muth : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. As far as, you've talked about the sustainability, the deposit growth, obviously very strong at 8% and how are you thinking about that going forward? Mac McCullough : So we continued to see \u2013 I think really good results on the consumer side of the balance sheet, as I mentioned in the previous answer, 5% year-over-year growth in noninterest-bearing is probably one of the better performances among the peer group. We're very focused on understanding what's happening from a competitive perspective. We're very focused on making sure that we bring things onto the sheet that the right rates. We have many, many programs underway on the retail side of the bank, in terms of sales execution, promotional pricing strategies. We look at different products and which products make the most sense for us, given what's happening in the marketplace. And we were able to pull those levers pretty well. So we feel good about the consumer side of the sheet. Commercial is a bit more challenging in terms of just rate expectations. We're monitoring and actually responding to those customer requests on a one-off basis. Obviously, we look at the tradeoff between what we can bring on a commercial deposit versus overnight funding. But we're very focused on supporting our deep customer relationships and making sure that we do what's right from a customer perspective in that regard. So we're very happy with what we see from a deposit growth on the balance sheet overall. And we continue to believe that we have many levers to be able to continue to see that growth take place. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then obviously that implies solid balance sheet growth going forward. And if you're trying to kind of pull it into your capital levels and maybe your buyback expectations for the next capital cycle, what are your thoughts on that? I know you're within your range on a CET1, you are at the high end of the range. So it seems like there might be some flexibility, but obviously the balance sheet growth will also likely be pretty solid. So how you're thinking about the buybacks in the next cycle here? Mac McCullough : Yes. I think, look, we're going to continue to manage through \u2013 towards the upper end of the CET1 range of 9% to 10%. So you're going to us be closer to the 10%. And we feel like we have a good balance of asset growth funded through core deposits and maintaining our capital levels at that 10% or near 10% CET1 level. So we haven't given our specific capital return expectations for the 2019 CCAR process. But as I had mentioned in my comments, we're going to be 70% to 80% total and 40% to 45% dividend payout. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jon Arfstrom : Great, thanks. Good morning. Just a question on credit maybe for Steve or Dan. Just the nature of the new NPLs and give us comfort that this is truly isolated in terms of what you're seeing on overall credit? Dan Neumeyer : Sure. Yes, so it's obviously something we monitor very closely is what's coming in the bucket, and what we're seeing is no concentration by sector, geography, et cetera. So the four largest NPLs we had were all different industries. And I think the flow this quarter, if you look at what we've been experiencing over the last year or so, it is lumpy. We've had a number of quarters where it improves and then we'll see a few move in, in an opposite direction, but if you look at our NPA and NAL ratios year-over-year, 2 basis points difference than what it was. So we remain very confident. We're not changing our outlook based on the new flows in terms of charge-offs to provision expense. So this \u2013 I think it all proves itself out that quarter-to-quarter, we see ups and downs. This happen to be a quarter, we're up a bit. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, that helps. And then Steve, you've said pretty clearly you do not foresee a recession. But if you do start to see signs, what might change in terms of your approach? Steve Steinour : Well, we've been working for years, Jon, with a view that something has been imminent and obviously wrong. So we've done a number of things and we're maintaining those. I think it was 3, 3.5 years ago, the teams led by Dan pulled back on leverage lending. We've done a lot with commercial real estate, construction, in particular. The concentration discipline stay in flow. This focus on portfolio management and assuming that there's something likely to occur near term, now for the couple \u2013 last couple of years has caused us to bolster our capabilities, our MIS. There are a whole series of things that we've already done and are maintaining. Now if we see it turning, we'll start adjusting where we think there's going to be further impact if to the extent we think there's any policy adjustment or other things. But it \u2013 we're running it fairly conservatively as we said we have been for a number of years notwithstanding the growth and expect that we're going to have relatively consistent performance through the cycle. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ken Zerbe : Great. Thanks. My first question just in terms of expenses, if I got it right, it was up $40 million, $50 million in 2Q, but then how should we think about the second half? Does some of that marketing expense come down and total expenses come down for the rest of the year? Or does it stay at that sort of 2Q level? Mac McCullough : Yes, Ken, it's Mac. So you will see expenses come down in the third and fourth quarters. The spike that we see in the second quarter is normal and has been included in all the guidance that we've been giving throughout the period. So you will see the efficiency ratio at its peak in the second quarter and it will come down in the third and fourth quarters. Ken Zerbe : Okay, that helps. And then just second question, in terms of the hedging activities, I guess, given that the Fed fund futures curve is already pricing in a rate cut, can you just walk us through the logic, like how much more hedging do you want to do? And does it make sense to do it if the curves already building in potential rate cuts from here? Thanks. Steve Steinour : Yes. Ken, so we're kind of implementing our way into the hedge position. We have about, let's say, $4 billion on at the end of first quarter. We're primarily focused on putting on BOR-OIS at this point, making sure that just in case we do get a rate hike from the Fed, we still benefit from that. But clearly, just given some of the uncertainty in direction of interest rates and given our asset sensitivity position, we just think it's a prudent exercise to go through and reduce some of that asset sensitivity, while still maintaining the upside using the BOR-OIS at this point in time. Ken Zerbe : All right, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pancari of Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Back to the credit topic, regarding the 19% increase in NPAs, I know you mentioned that it's not any one industry. I know you see the largest existing NPLs are not in any one, but how about the inflows this quarter, it looks like a big portion of it came from auto suppliers? Dan Neumeyer : Well, actually, since our numbers are so low, John, that the increase is in one credit. It was of our largest inflow in the quarter, but that is one deal. And of the four largest inflows this quarter, they are in four different industries. They're originated in different \u2013 they're not all from one vintage, they're not all in a singular geography. I mean that's just the dispersion happened in the few more this quarter than we typically do. John Pancari : Got it. And had that one large credit that went in, has that already been reserved for or no? Dan Neumeyer : It has and we foresee a favorable outcome on that particular deal. Mac McCullough : Later this year actually. So you also \u2013 Dan has accounted for, the SNCC exams in the current reserves as well. Dan Neumeyer : Yes. And we didn't have tremendous activity this quarter, but the SNCC results are incorporated in everything you see today. John Pancari : Okay. Got it. All right. And then separately on capital, I know you reiterated the higher end of that 9% to 10% CET1 target. Like what keeps you near that high end? What keeps you at that biased versus potentially moving towards the lower end of it over time? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes. So we just feel more comfortable operating at the higher end of that range. And if you take a look at us relative to our peer groups, we are a bit lower than the peer group. We do believe that the peer group is migrating down to us as they execute on their capital actions. But we feel comfortable at that higher level and obviously we're producing industry-leading returns at that higher capital level. So we feel very good about how we're positioned. Steve Steinour : John, there's a little bit of history where the capital was deployed substantially in the FirstMerit acquisition. So we pulled capital levels down with an expectation of replenishing over time, and we thought about being or expecting that we're somewhere later in the cycle. So that would guide us to the higher end of that range. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning, everybody. So on the NIM, I'm trying to better understand the offsets to the higher deposit cost coming and which we think will get us modest NIM expansion on core this year. If we look at the rates on new loans and new securities that you are adding each quarter, how much above the current earning asset yield are those coming into the book? Steve Steinour : Yes, Steven, so virtually all of the new production that we're putting on the sheet is going to be higher than the back book on the asset side. We've been particularly focused on indirect auto pricing. We've been very successful in raising pricing, which has had the result of reducing origination, but we're fine with that trade off. We've also been very focused on really pricing across the entire consumer loan category, resi, mortgage, it's been another area of focus for us. And then on the commercial side, we're in the middle of renewal season and we're looking for opportunities to continue to increase our pricing there. So we're very active on the asset side in terms of things that we're doing, just to make sure that we're getting every basis point to help offset some of the continued pressure on the deposit side. We are going to see continued migration of deposit rates up over the last half of the year, but that is all factored into our guidance and we do feel comfortable with the expectations that we put out there for the NIM. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. And then \u2013 thank you. And then just for a follow-up, if we look at $23 billion of money market deposits, that's average you're paying around 1%. Where do you see that topping out assuming that Fed stays on hold here? Mac McCullough : So it will continue to migrate higher. We basically run six months special pricing and then if it comes back to a lower rate. I'm not quite sure that we're going to see it. Migrate much higher, it's probably going to be 25, 50 basis points perhaps. But it just depends on the level of competition, what's happening in the marketplace and how we choose to fund the balance sheet. You saw us moved to CDs in early 2018 because we thought that was the opportunity. We switched back to money market, kind of the middle of 2018. But we're always looking at what is happening in the market from a competition perspective. And we're pretty good at finding the right levers in terms of getting the right growth. Steven Alexopoulos : Mac, you just mentioned commercial customers are moving out of non-interest bearing into products like this. Is that continuing at the same pace or now the rates have stabilized, are you seeing that ease? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes. I do think it is easing a bit. We did see continued migration in the first quarter. And it's going to contain to migrate. But I do think that the rate of migration is slowing down. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Mac McCullough : Thanks Steven. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Winter : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : You guys had a very strong quarter on C&I loan growth. And I'm just wondering, do you think that type of growth rate a sustainable or where there some other factors that contributed to that growth that might reverse overtime? Dan Neumeyer : Yes, this is Dan. Well I think generally, our customers continue to be fairly positive. So, the pipelines remain strong. I think that the growth was diversified in that, not any one area accounted for the bulk of it, everything from middle markets to our business credit, asset based healthcare, they all contributed. So I think that it's within our risk appetite, we have certainly pulled back where we feel we can't compete within a risk appetite. So I don't see any meaningful shifts in the volumes that we would anticipate for the balance of the year. Peter Winter : Okay. And then just staying on the loan side. Mac, I heard your comments about the increase in the auto pricing for the auto loans. I did notice that quarter-to-quarter auto loans decline. Would you expect that to be a temporary decline? Mac McCullough : Peter, it's likely going to be stable to declining going forward because we're very, very pleased with the pricing actions that we're taking. We're very pleased with the volumes that we're generating. And we just think it's the right tactic given where we are from a rate perspective and the concentration of auto on the balance sheet. So I would expect stable to declining going forward. Peter Winter : Thanks, Mac. Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks, Peter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : I just wanted to follow-up on some of the capital. I noticed, I mean, the amount of buybacks in the first quarter were relatively low compared to first two quarters and then you still had a lot left over. Is there any reason behind pulling back on the buybacks in the first quarter versus leaving significant more for the second quarter? Steve Steinour : It really just looking at some of the volatility and some of the events in the first quarter, I mean, Brexit and other items just had us hit the pause button for a while. We did do the $25 million and we will complete the remaining $152 million in the second quarter. But really just taking a look at the environment and maybe being a little more cautious about the buyback, but we'll pick it up in the second quarter. Dan Neumeyer : We also pulled a \u2013 about a little less than $100 million forward from the plan as approved by the Fed for the year, put it in \u2013 accelerated into the fourth quarter. So if you will, we almost prefunded the fourth quarter with the first quarter. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then to follow-up on some of the credit comments. Was any change in the severity that you saw on any of these loans? Or I guess, the recovery amount that you would get on some of the commercial loans than you've seen in the past given the credit losses that we saw this quarter? Mac McCullough : Yes. So I think severity, no. Now recoveries are slowly dwindling. So a small portion of the increase in net charge-offs was from lower recoveries. So that's just a fact given how lower charge-offs have been. But I think when you look at the portfolio as a whole, everything was really rocksteady with the exception of C&I. And I just think for context, if you look at the C&I category, again if you average the last four quarters, we had 15 basis points of charge-offs. Two quarters ago, we actually had net recoveries. So I think it's important to look at that in total because as we've mentioned in a quarter anything can happen and I think this quarter we happened to see just a little bit more activity than normal, but overall, we feel really confident in the book. Kevin Barker : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : I was just hoping, Mac, you might be able to touch on some of the key drivers that you see going through the remainder of the year. I guess sort of underlying the question is, if we were to sort of target the midpoint of your revenue growth range, it implies a pretty substantial ramp in the remaining three quarters of the year relative to the base from the first quarter. And of course, we're entering the seasonally stronger periods of the year. But just curious to hear your thoughts on what would be the main drivers that that caused that shift up in the base of fees and revenues overall? Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks, Scott. So it's important to remember that the first quarter is seasonally low for us and we also had about $10 million of unusual items, if you think about the MSR and then the commodities write down. So that that's roughly $9.5 million, $10 million. So a little bit light in the first quarter driven by those two events and also just the normal seasonality. Going forward, it's going to be the usual suspects. We're going to see growth \u2013 we'll continue to see growth in deposit service charges as we bring on new customers and we continuing to see good household growth and good deep relationships. We've got some new treasury management capabilities coming out this year in business banking that should help us significantly as we move through the year. The capital markets line just continues to grow for us. The Hutchinson Shockey acquisition is going to help quite a little bit. And we've made good investments in people and our product in that group. The payments line is a good grower for us. It's debit, credit, ATM, merchant processing and that's going to continue to show good growth as well. So I do recognize some of the weakness in the first quarter, but I feel good about the remainder of the year, with mortgage in particular coming back in the spring as we would typically see it. So yes, I think the outlook for the year should be good. Scott Siefers : All right. I appreciate that color. Thank you very much. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Scott. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Please go ahead. Brock Vandervliet : Good morning. Yes, going back to the margin theme, I think other questions have covered the deposit dynamics, but could you talk about borrowings. The sequential growth in borrowings I noted this quarter very similar to last year where it grew very quickly in Q1 and then you tapered it down the rest of the year. Is that likely to be the similar pattern this year? Mac McCullough : Yes, Brock. I would expect that be a very similar pattern to what you saw last year. And it just does come back a bit to some of the seasonality on deposit growth and deposit usage among our customers. And first quarter is always a bit seasonally low and then the growth comes back as we move through the year. So that is typically what happens. Brock Vandervliet : Okay. Great. And just as a follow-up on in terms of loan repricing and sort of tailwinds you may have there, could you just review of the portion of the loan book that's variable rate, how much is tied to LIBOR versus other longer term rates? Mac McCullough : I think it's about 60% of the portfolio is tied to 1-month LIBOR. Steve Steinour : It's floating. Mac McCullough : It's floating. Okay. Steve Steinour : And the biggest fees would be 1-month LIBOR within that. Brock Vandervliet : Okay, got it. Fine on that. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for closing comments. Steve Steinour : So thank you. Before I wrap up, we wanted to take a minute to thank our Chief Credit Officer, Dan Neumeyer, for his decade of service with Huntington. Today is his final earnings conference call before his retirement in June. And his leadership in the aftermath of the global financial crisis drove the company to be where it is today in terms of performance. Dan's been a vital leader in instilling Huntington's credit culture and discipline and establishing our risk management \u2013 credit risk management infrastructure. So thank you very much, Dan. Now we're pleased that Rich Pohle, currently our Deputy Chief Credit Officer and Senior Commercial Credit Approval Officer will be stepping up into the Chief Credit Officer role upon Dan's retirement. Rich has been a key member of the Huntington team for almost a decade, and our team will benefit from his disciplined approach and many years of experience. Our first quarter results provided a good start to the year and I'm confident about our prospects for the full year. Our top priorities remain executing our strategic plan to prudently grow revenue and to thoughtfully invest in our businesses for continued organic growth. We're building long-term shareholder value through a diligent focus on top quartile financial performance and consistently disciplined risk management. And finally, I always like to end with a reminder to our shareholders that there's a high level of alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively the seventh largest shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Mark Muth : Thank you, Sherri. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1 hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. Unfortunately, Huntington's Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Steinour, is unable to join us today.Earlier this week, while training for the upcoming Pelotonia charity bike ride, Steve injured his shoulder, requiring surgery, and that has prevented his participation in our second quarter earnings call today. He's already on the mend and expected to return to work in the coming days.As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Mac. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a solid second quarter, reporting net income of $364 million, an increase of 3% from the year ago quarter. Earnings per common share were up $0.33, up 10% from the year ago quarter. Tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $7.97, also a 10% year-over-year increase. Our profitability ratios remain strong as our return on tangible common equity was 18%, and our return on assets was 1.36%. Total revenue increased 6% year-over-year.Average loans increased 4% year-over-year, including a 5% increase in consumer loans and a 4% increase in commercial loans. Average core deposits increased 4% year-over-year as we continue to fully fund loan growth with core deposits. Overall asset quality remained strong as most credit ratios remained near cyclical lows.As we guided to on the first quarter earnings conference call, net charge-offs declined this quarter back to a level below the low end of our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. As we have noted previously, we expect some quarter-to-quarter volatility given the very low loss and problem loan levels at which we are operating. Our ratios for nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized loans all remain very good.As briefly outlined on slide three, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through-the-cycle shareholder returns. We continue to make profitable and meaningful long-term investments in our business, particularly around customer experience, to drive organic growth. This quarter, we were pleased to receive an important independent confirmation of our digital technology investments and our customer experience focused strategy with two awards from J.D. Power, the gold standard of customer satisfaction surveys in the U.S. Huntington received the highest scores in both the J.D.Power 2019 U.S. online banking and mobile app satisfaction studies. While some expressed skepticism that regional banks will be able to keep up with the large money center banks and a technology-driven economy, we believe this provides evidence that our focused technology investments and our strategy provide Huntington not just the opportunity to keep up but to remain industry-leading in our client acquisition and our customer satisfaction. We also prudently allocate our capital to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risk, consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.This quarter, we took several actions to better position the balance sheet from an interest rate management perspective but also with respect to overall risk and return. We exited certain loans and high-cost deposit relationships which no longer met our return hurdles, and we repositioned a portion of the securities portfolio.I will discuss these actions in more detail in a few minutes. We are very pleased with how we are positioned. We have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe are delivering and will continue to deliver top quartile financial performance in the future. We remain focused on driving sustained, long-term financial performance for our shareholders.Slide four illustrates our updated expectations for full year 2019 compared to our prior expectations. As you know, we previously provided our expectations assuming no change in short-term interest rates. However, this quarter, we are transitioning to provide our expectations based on the implied forward curve, which are provided in the column on the right side.Given the high likelihood that the Fed will reduce the Fed funds target rate at their meeting next week and the market expectations for multiple additional rate cuts over the coming year, we thought it was more conservative to adopt this interest rate outlook in our planning and forecasting process internally as well as externally in the expectations we communicate to you. We also have provided an unchanged rate view in the middle column on the slide.This quarter, we provided both interest rate scenarios so you can see the incremental steps between the two but do not plan to provide both views going forward. For the remainder of 2019, we intend to only provide expectations based on the implied forward rate scenario. Our view of the economy has not changed since last quarter's earnings call. We continue to have a constructive view of the local economies in our footprint, which we expect will translate into continued organic growth this year.While the volatility in the debt markets has signaled street concerns regarding the broader economy, what we are hearing from our customers remains positive. Businesses in our local markets generally continue to deliver good performance, and our commercial pipelines remain strong.Businesses in our footprint are investing in capital expenditures and expansions while the tight labor markets continue to constrain economic growth. Our commercial customers continue to tell us that finding employees is their biggest challenge. The job openings rate for the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Some of these businesses also have weathered the headwinds of ongoing tariff and trade disputes. Despite a slowing world economy and these headwinds, the data shows that exports have continued to grow in Ohio and other areas of our region. Across our footprint, consumers also remain upbeat with strong labor markets driving wage inflation, particularly at the lower compensation levels.In the 3 months ending May of 2019 and the 12 months ending May of 2019, unemployment rates declined in 18 of 20 of the largest MSAs in Huntington's footprint states. Additionally, consumer confidence in our regions generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. Job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in most of our markets. I would summarize by saying that we remain bullish in the economy and our footprint.As I have stated on several occasions this year, we do not see signs of a near-term economic downturn. Nonetheless, we are cognizant of the recent market volatility and global economic data that does not share the optimism of what we are seeing here in the Midwest. These ultimately could drive the Fed to adjust short-term interest rates lower.As we communicated on the last earnings call, we have taken steps to prepare for a more challenging interest rate outlook. We do not foresee a recession in the near term. However, our core earnings power, strong capital, aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite and our long-term strategic alignment position us to withstand economic headwinds. Our strategy is designed to drive more consistent performance across economic cycles. Let's turn to our revised full year 2019 expectations. We have modestly reduced our balance sheet growth expectations reflecting the balance sheet optimization efforts from the second quarter and a more competitive operating environment at the margin.We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 5% and full year average deposit growth in the range of 2% to 3%. We remain particularly focused on growing core deposits through acquiring core checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. We expect full year revenue growth of 3% to 4.5%. On a GAAP basis, full year 2018 NIM -- sorry, 2019 NIM is expected to be 3.25% to 3.30% range.This includes the negative impacts from the anticipated reduction in the benefit of purchase accounting and the cost of the incremental hedging strategy we implemented in the second quarter. Looking further out, our current modeling suggests that NIM will bottom out during the second half of 2019. As a result, we currently expect full year 2020 NIM should relatively consistent with full year 2019, allowing net interest income to grow in tandem with earning asset growth next year.As we have told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions, we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage this year. We have moderated the expense growth outlook for 2019 in conjunction with the reduced revenue growth outlook. We have achieved this with a combination of reductions to discretionary spending and with the repacing of planned investments.Full year 2019 noninterest expense is now expected to increase 1% to 2.5%. We anticipate that full year 2019 net charge-offs will remain below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range. Slide five provides the highlights for the 2019 second quarter.Results reflected strong earnings momentum with double-digit growth rates in earnings per common share and tangible book value per share along with continuing improvement in our profitability ratios. We recorded net income of $364 million, an increase of 3% versus the year ago quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.33, up 10% year-over-year and tangible book value per common share ended the quarter at $7.97, a 10% year-over-year increase. Return on assets was 1.36%, return on common equity, 14% and return on tangible common equity was 18%. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 57.6%, up from 56.6% in the year ago quarter.And again, we reminded you in the first quarter call that the second quarter would be the peak efficiency ratio for the year. This modest increase reflects continued thoughtful investments in our colleagues and technology. For the full year, we continue to expect modest year-over-year improvement in our efficiency ratio consistent with driving annual positive operating leverage. Turning now to slide six. Average earning assets increased to $2.8 billion or 3% compared to the year ago quarter. Loan growth accounted for more than the entire increase as average loans and leases increased $3 billion or 4% year-over-year including a $1.7 billion or 5% increase in consumer loans and a $1.3 billion or 4% increase in commercial loans.Average commercial and industrial loans grew 6% from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well diversified over the past year with notable growth in corporate banking, asset finance, dealer floor plan and middle market banking. We also continue to see good early traction in our new specialty lending verticals that were announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan. Alternatively, we continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average CRE loans reflecting a 6% year-over-year decline.This reflects both anticipated and unanticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending to ensure appropriate returns on capital and to manage risk. During the second quarter, we exited approximately $400 million of our commercial loans at renewal or through loan sales as part of our balance sheet optimization efforts.These loans no longer met our return hurdles and their exit allowed us to redeploy the associated funding into more attractive opportunities. Consumer loan growth remained centered in the residential mortgage and RV and marine portfolios, reflecting the well-managed expansion of these 2 businesses since the FirstMerit parent acquisition. Average residential mortgage loans increased 14% year-over-year.As we typically do, we sold agency-qualified mortgage production in the quarter and generally retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Average RV and marine loans increased 28% year-over-year as we continue to gain traction and market share across the 34-state footprint for this business. Average auto loans were flat year-over-year. Originations totaled $1.3 billion for the second quarter, down 19% year-over-year. As we have previously mentioned, we are executing a pricing strategy to optimize revenue via increased auto loan pricing that has resulted in lower production volumes, but that is a trade-off we like.New money yields on our auto originations averaged 4.63% during the second quarter, up 41 basis points from the year ago quarter. Over the past few weeks, new money yields in both auto and RV/marine have come under some pressure due to the year-to-date movements in the 2- the 5-year portion of the yield curve and increased competition. Finally, securities were down 4% year-over-year as we let the portfolio run off and utilized the cash flow to fund higher-yielding loans during 2019.During the 2019 second quarter, we sold 1 billion of securities as part of the balance sheet optimization efforts to reduce our reliance on short-term wholesale funding, repurchased $600 million of securities related to the hedging program, and late in the quarter, we remixed approximately $500 million of securities at a net benefit of approximately 20 basis points.Turning to slide seven. Average total deposits grew 3% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 4% year-over-year. Average money market deposits increased 11% year-over-year reflecting the shift in promotional pricing away from CDs to consumer money market accounts in mid-2018. Core certificates of deposit were up 54% from the year ago quarter primarily reflecting the consumer CD growth initiatives during the first 3 quarters of 2018. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 3% year-over-year while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 3%. Average total demand deposits were flat year-over-year.As shown on slide 32 in the appendix, we are very pleased that our consumer noninterest-bearing deposits increased 5% year-over-year as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships. We continue to see our commercial customers shift balances from noninterest-bearing DDA to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market.Average savings and other domestic deposits decreased 9% primarily reflecting a continued shift in consumer product mix, particularly among legacy FirstMerit accounts as FirstMerit's promotional pricing strategy is focused on savings accounts compared to our primary focus on money market accounts. Importantly, our continued focus on core funding allowed for a 23% year-over-year reduction in noncore deposits.Moving down to slide eight. FTE net interest income increased $28 million or 4% versus the year ago quarter primarily driven by the 3% increase in average earning assets. We saw net interest margin expansion of 2 basis points to 3.31% compared to the 2018 second quarter as a result of disciplined asset and deposit pricing and the benefit of interest rate increases partially offset by the continued runoff of purchase accounting accretion. Moving to slide nine. Our core net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.26%, up 4 basis points from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 5 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to 8 basis points in the year ago quarter.Slide 28 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of the FirstMerit purchase accounting accretion for 2019 and 2020. Turning to the earning asset yields. Our commercial loan yields increased 30 basis points year-over-year while consumer loan yields increased 33 basis points. Securities yields increased eight basis points. Our deposit costs remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 97 basis points for the quarter, up 38 basis points year-over-year and up just three basis points sequentially. I might add that we expect total interest-bearing deposit costs to decline in both the third and the fourth quarters of 2019.Turning to slide 10. On a sequential basis, the GAAP NIM compressed 8 basis points and the core NIM compressed 7 basis points. The lower and inverted yield curve included the impact on LIBOR rates, accounted for approximately 3 basis points of the NIM compression, while the continued lift in deposit cost drove 2 basis points. The incremental hedging strategy implemented in the second quarter compressed the NIM by 1 basis point and is also expected to have a negative 1 basis point impact on the full year 2019 NIM, modestly better than the guidance we provided at an industry conference in May.Turning to slide 11. Slide 11 provides an update to a slide we presented at an industry conference during the second quarter that summarizes the incremental hedging strategy to reduce the downside risk from lower interest rates. The incremental hedges include both asset swaps and floors. We have now substantially completed implementation of the incremental hedges. However, as you should expect, we will continue to fine-tune the overall hedging program as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate. It's also important to remember that we've had the cost of the hedging program, including the incremental hedging executed in the second quarter, in our guidance since late 2018.Turning to slide 12. Slide 12 illustrates our cycle-to-date interest-bearing deposit beta compared to peers. Our cumulative deposit beta remains low at 33%. We have been communicating that we believe the consumer core CD strategies we utilized over the first three quarters of 2018 would serve us well over time, effectively front-loading some of the deposit beta. You can see those benefits over the past 3 quarters as our cumulative data has not increased as quickly as peers and is now below the peer average. This quarter, the peer group's average cumulative beta increased 4% while we saw a 1% increase in our cumulative beta.Overall, commercial deposit competition was elevated throughout the second quarter, and competition for consumer deposits to date has not yet retrenched as much as expected despite the likely Fed rate cuts next week. Given this competitive environment and the near-term rate outlook, we've maintained our pricing discipline and shortened our promotional pricing terms such as utilizing a 6-month money market promotional rate compared to a 12-month promotion common in the marketplace. We also chose to fund loan growth through the securities sales that I mentioned earlier rather than paying up for high-cost commercial deposits.Looking forward, we have developed strategies down to the customer level to quickly react, particularly along our highest-cost deposits should the Fed cut rates next year -- next week as expected. We have also approximately $3 billion of securities in excess of what is needed for LCR that we could use as a funding source should market deposit pricing become unattractive. Slide 13 provides detail on our noninterest income, which increased 11% from the year ago quarter. Other noninterest income increased 48% year-over-year primarily due to the $15 million gain on the sale of our Wisconsin retail branches as well as the $5 million mark-to-market adjustment on economic hedges.Subsequent to quarter end, we redesignated all the economic hedges as cash flow hedges. So beginning in 3Q of '19, all the swaps and floors will be accounted for as cash flow hedges. Capital market fees were up 31% versus the year ago quarter primarily reflecting the acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey and Erley in the 2018 fourth quarter. Mortgage banking income increased 21% primarily reflecting higher secondary market spreads. On a linked quarter basis, mortgage banking income also benefited from seasonality and, to a lesser extent, lower mortgage interest rates during the quarter.Slide 14 provides the components of the 7% year-over-year growth in noninterest expense. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we expected noninterest expense to increase $40 million to $50 million linked quarter, with 2/3 of that coming from normal seasonality and compensation expense as a result of the annual grant of our long-term incentive compensation in May as well as the May implementation of annual merit increases. Personnel expense increased 8% year-over-year primarily reflecting these actions. Further increasing personnel expense year-over-year was the continued hiring of experienced bankers in our new lending verticals as well as adding colleagues in our digital and technology areas related to the 2018 strategic plan initiatives.Outside data processing and other services increased 29% year-over-year driven by ongoing technology investment costs. Other noninterest expense increased 24% primarily reflecting a $5 million donation to the Columbus Foundation and the impact of new lease accounting standards on personal property tax expense. Partially offsetting these increases, deposit and other insurance expense decreased 56% due to the discontinuation of the FDI surcharge in the 2018 fourth quarter. Slide 15 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. The tangible common equity ratio ended the quarter at 7.80%, up 2 basis points from the year ago quarter.The common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.88%, down 65% year-over-year but up 4 basis points linked quarter. We continue to manage CET1 within our 9% to 10% operating guideline with a bias towards the operating end of the range. We repurchased 71.8 million common shares over the last 4 quarters. During the 2019 second quarter, we repurchased 11.3 million common shares at an average cost of $13.40 per share, representing the remaining $152 million of common stock repurchase authorization in the 2018 capital plan.As we announced last month, our 2019 capital plan reflects our previously articulated priorities to fund organic growth first; to support the cash dividend second; and third, to pursue all other capital uses including buybacks. These capital priorities have not changed. The 2019 capital plan includes a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.15 per share beginning with the dividend that the Board declared last week and payable in October. Last week, the Board also approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to 513 million of common shares over the next 4 quarters.Let me now turn it over to Rich to cover slide 16 with the credit trends for the quarter. Rich? Rich Pohle : Thanks, Mac. Slide 16 provides a snapshot of key quality metrics for the quarter, which remain strong. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of $58 million in the second quarter and net charge-offs of $48 million. Our provision expense has not exceeded net charge-offs in 6 of the past 7 quarters, illustrating our high-quality earnings.Net charge-offs represented an annualized 25 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 16 basis points in the year ago quarter and, as expected, down from 38 basis points in the prior quarter. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides, and there was no industry concentration to speak of. The allowance for loan and lease losses, or ALLL, as a percentage of loans remained relatively stable at 1.03%, up 1 basis point linked quarter.The nonperforming asset ratio remained flat linked quarter and increased 4 basis points year-over-year to 61 basis points. The year-over-year increases was centered in the C&I portfolio partially offset by decreases in the commercial real estate, residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. There was also a year-over-year increase in other NPAs associated with the investment portfolio. Overall, asset quality metrics remain near cyclical bests. And as we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans.I'll now turn it back to Mac for some closing remarks. Mac McCullough : Thanks, Rich. Slide 17 highlights the actions we have taken since 2009 resulting in our current industry-leading profitability metrics. Our 14% return on common equity and 18% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top-performing regional bank. We are building a best-in-class return profile at Huntington, and we are excited about the opportunities that this creates.Let me turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Thanks, Mac. Sherri. We will now take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed. Scott Siefers : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mac, I just wanted to ask a little about the margin guidance. So I guess first of all, just appreciate the commentary with both the just the flat rate and the implied forward curve. That's helpful, so thank you for that.But then just as you look at the anticipated contraction in the margin for the second half of the year, just given that it implies some severe contraction in the back half, I wonder if you could just walk through what the main nuances would be that would allow you to come in toward the higher end versus the lower end. In other words, how do we get to the median part of the range? Mac McCullough : Yes, Scott. I think the wild card of the mix is going to be what happens with core deposit growth and the cost of core deposits. Right now, we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing. We're being selective in terms of the commercial deposits and paying up for commercial deposits, but we're seeing good growth on the consumer side. And I would tell you that competition in our region is rational. As I mentioned in the script, we have taken our deposit strategy and tactics to a different place relative to the peers.We've become, I think, less aggressive in terms of incremental pricing as we enter this lower-rate environment, but we're comfortable with that just given some of the strength we see on the consumer deposit side but also the excess liquidity that we have in terms of being able to release securities and use that funding to basically put higher-margin loans on the balance sheet. So it's really the cost of deposits and the deposits got a growth in the second half, but I'm confident that we're well positioned for that. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And then just separately, so expenses will have to come down fairly meaningfully in the second half of the year. I know there was a lot of seasonality that hit the second quarter numbers. So presumably, there's some relief in sight. But just wondering if you could talk for a second about kind of the puts and takes on the cost side as we enter the second half of the year, please. Mac McCullough : Yes. Sure. So we've been, I think, pretty transparent around the opportunities that we have to adjust our expense growth in 2019 for the revenue environments and what we see happening with interest rates going forward. We've started to take those actions. A lot of the expense growth in 2019 has come out of strategic initiatives that we put in place in 2018 through the strategic planning process. We've deferred some of those investments.However, we are continuing to make investments and the initiatives that we think are most beneficial from our revenue growth or risk perspective or just thinking about what we need to do from technology development, particularly in digital.Those investments are still on the table. So we've been, I think, appropriately prudent in terms of the investments that we're continuing with, and there's always the likelihood that the rate environment turns out better than what is being foreshadowed right now that we would put more of those investments back on the table. So we believe we've got the capability to manage the positive operating leverage in 2019. And certainly for 2020, it's going to depend on where the revenue environment goes, but we still have expense levers that we can pull. Scott Siefers : Okay that's perfect. Thank you very much Mac, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks, good morning guys. Mac McCullough : Good morning Jon. Jon Arfstrom : The question a little bit about commercial lending. You talked about the exit of 400 million commercial balances. I don't know if it's for you, Rich, but curious, can we expect more of that? And can you maybe talk about some of the primary reasons behind some of those decisions? Rich Pohle : Yes. Jon, it's Rich. I think a lot of the decision on the 400 million was just around rate and yield. And as we looked to optimize the balance sheet, I think we focused on low-yielding assets that may not have been part of the primary bank relationship that really just didn't make sense to continue moving forward on. So I would say that we're going to continue to look at customer profitability going forward.And to the extent that we have borrowers that don't meet our relationships, we'll look to make adjustments, either try to strengthen that relationship and make it more profitable or look to exit. So I think Q2 had a fair number exits in there, and I would say it's just a continuing process going forward as we focus on the balance sheet and where we can be most profitable. Mac McCullough : Yes. Jon, it's Mac. So I might add, this is the play that we ran in 2017 with great success. We -- I think when we did this in 2017, we picked up about 41 basis points of CET1. So we do this on a regular basis. We're always looking at the balance sheet at a very granular level. And in this environment, we just think it's a prudent thing to do to make sure that our capital is working hard and that we're putting ourselves in the position to fund the balance sheet and get the right returns in this environment. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. It make sense. And I guess that goes to my next follow-up here is just the loan growth numbers. You took in the -- it's very subtle and modest, but you took in a higher range of loan growth range and also deposits, and can you just maybe talk a little bit about that, the purpose of that? Mac McCullough : Yes. So part of it is the -- what we continue to do from an auto perspective. We continue to price for profitability as opposed to the volume, so that continues to be the play that we're running. And I think we just became on the margin a bit more conservative in terms of what we would expect from growth on the loan side in 2019, not because the pipelines are in worse shape because they're actually in really good shape, but I think the mood here is just one of caution and just making sure that we're careful and we put on the balance sheet what we feel comfortable with.But from a deposit perspective, it has everything to do with the tactics that we're taking in the marketplace where we're leading the market down from a CD perspective -- CD pricing perspective and also the tactics that we're using to raise money market deposits. We're using a 6-month guaranteed term on rate, and the market is still at a 12-month. So we do expect that this will have some incremental impact on deposit growth, but we're fine with that. As I mentioned, we've got the excess liquidity that we can always fall back on.And I guess the other part of that is just commercial deposit pricing and not wanting to pay up for deposits in this environment. We certainly take a look at the relationships, as Rich mentioned. And to the extent it's a deep relationship or a potential for a deep relationship, we certainly work with the client. But I have no interest in $100 million with no other relationship and paying up for that deposit at this point in time. So the growth rates reflect those tactics and strategies. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, all right, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please proceed. Brian Foran : Hey, good morning. I wish I had $100 million deposit, to give you. Mac McCullough : The largely you brought other products along with that we'd be fine. Brian Foran : The, so on the NIM, you kind of talked about the bottoming in the second half of '19 and I think you said stable in 2020. And I just wanted to clarify are you talking the stable relative to the 3.25% to 3.30% full year range? Or are you thinking more stable to whatever the fourth quarter exit run rate NIM is? Mac McCullough : Yes. Brian, that's a great question. This was full year 2019 NIM of 3.25% to 3.30%. We expect it to be stable in 2020 in that range. Brian Foran : And I mean I guess that seems to imply a little bit of a bounce back up in 2020. Is it deposit pricing catch-up? Or what would kind of make the 2020 NIM maybe slightly higher than the fourth quarter exit for the year? Mac McCullough : Yes. As you might expect, deposit pricing is going to have a bit of a lag to it. So we actually see the largest benefit from -- well, we expect from a deposit pricing perspective in the fourth quarter of 2019, and that will continue into 2020 along with the impacts of the hedge program. Assuming we get the implied forward curve the way it is currently forecast, the hedge program will kick in and give us some incremental margin to help offset what's happened in the rate environment. Mark Muth : Brian, this is Mark. Remember, the CD campaign last year and the first 3 quarters, those all mature beginning in the third quarter. So as those roll off, we're assuming they'll reprice down nicely. Brian Foran : And if I could sneak in one less clarification or expansion, I think you mentioned July auto pricing competition might have picked up a little bit. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color on what you saw there? Mac McCullough : Yes. We've been pretty consistent in terms of raising pricing in the marketplace. It's been a good play for us. We typically see the competition follow. But in this environment, as we had some of the higher rates out, we felt that maybe we weren't getting the right type of customer, maybe a slight deterioration in some of the credit metrics. And so we quickly changed the pricing strategy, and everything fell back into place the way we would expect to see it. But that is the barometer that we use.I mean we have a box for credit on the auto book that we don't move outside of. And we change pricing based upon what we see happening, and that, of course, takes into consideration many factors, what's happening in the marketplace, what's happening with competition, what's happening with interest rates, but the one variable that we hold constant when thinking about pricing in the auto book is where we're at from a credit perspective. Mark Muth : And on the boat and RV side, we've seen a couple of new entrants into the market and one legacy participant expand nationally, and the combination of those 3 has significantly increased pricing competition for boat and RV loans here over the last few months. Operator : Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed. John Pancari : Morning, regarding your 2019 to 2021 longer-term goals -- or medium-term goals, should we call it, I noticed you didn't include them in the -- in your slides or mention them. So I just wanted to see if you have any updated thoughts on those targets, particularly around the efficiency guidance of 53% to 56% and also in the ROTCE outlook for 17% to 20%. Mac McCullough : Yes. No, we're still comfortable with those long-term targets. Didn't mean to signal anything by not including them in the slide deck or the presentation. So those are our targets for the next 3 to 5 years. John Pancari : Okay. Great. And then separately on the 2019 revenue outlook of 3% to 4.5%, can you give us a little bit more detail how that would break out between spread revenue and fees? And then also, has your fee income outlook changed at all? And if so, what is changing that view? Mac McCullough : Yes. So we're having a really good year on the fee side. Capital markets continues to perform very well. We're making smart investments in that business. We've got a terrific team and a really good opportunity across the franchise, in particular when you think about the FirstMerit legacy customers and some of the capabilities that we bring to that customer base. We still have opportunities as it relates to capital markets products and being able to have deeper relationships with those customers. We got a good product set, and we feel very good about the outlook for that business. It's going to continuing to grow, assuming the economy cooperates.Treasury management is another place for us that we feel very good with the momentum and what we're seeing in the field. In particular, we're seeing some new product capabilities in the business banking space that is actually producing some incremental growth that we expected and excited to see developing. So that's a category that works for us as well. And then mortgage, we do expect that we're going to have continued good results in 2019. We're going to continue to see good refinance opportunities, and the secondary marketing spread has actually improved as well so that helps.And then we continue to grow households. I mean we're continuing to grow consumer households. We're continuing to see deposit service charges increase in conjunction with that household growth, and we're getting good deposit growth out of that expansion in households as well. So the growth in 2019 is going to be weighted more on a percentage basis to fee income, which is partially some of the strength in the categories that I mentioned but also the rate environment and what's happening to the -- for the NIM. But very excited about the momentum we have on the fee side. John Pancari : Okay. So that 3% to 4.5% revenue outlook for '19, that did come down, but that was mainly all spread income then, correct? Mac McCullough : That would be correct, yes. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thanks, Mac. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ken Zerbe : Thank you. Hi, guys I guess my first question is in terms of the hedging that you did this quarter, accelerating your hedging. We've heard from some other banks this quarter that they did not do hedging or that they thought because the curve was pricing in a significant decline in rates, the hedging was not the right decision for them. Can you just talk about why accelerating your hedging was the right decision for Huntington and maybe differ from other banks? And what are you assuming in terms of the rate outlook from here that makes it the right choice? Mac McCullough : So our implied outlook has the Fed decreasing in July and September of this year and May and October of 2020. So basically, we began the hedge program, I think, at a time when we felt the economics of putting the hedge on made sense relative to the outlook we had for the environment and what was going to happen to interest rates going forward. There certainly came a time when I would say that the benefit was fully reflected in the price of those hedges and we pulled back, but we felt that we got the program in place to the extent that it stabilized the margin going forward, which is what we were trying to accomplish.So clearly, different of every bank in terms of where you're at from an asset liability position and the mix of your balance sheet and what you expect from growth going forward, but we feel that we kind of hit it right in terms of what we did and the impact that it's going to have on the margin going forward. Ken Zerbe : Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, maybe just a clarification for us, I think you mentioned all your swaps and floors next quarter are going to be considered cash flow hedges. Can you just remind us what that means and why it's better than something else? Mac McCullough : So the economic hedges that we have running through fee income at this point as they get mark-to-market, we did not set those up to qualify for hedge accounting. So basically, we would match them up with, say, a commercial loan portfolio, and through that, we would get hedge accounting that would allow us to reflect the benefit or the detriment of those derivatives through the margin.The economic hedges that we moved up into the category to get hedge accounting, they did flow through the fee income in the second quarter and I think a little bit in the first quarter as well. But basically, I'd rather have the impact in the margin. And we have the capacity to basically reflect those as qualifying for hedge accounting, and we did that actually early in the third quarter. Mark Muth : Yes. Ken, so that $5 million mark-to-market that hit fee income this quarter, going forward, that would run through OCI instead of through the P&L. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed. Peter Winter : I was looking at the loan-to-deposit ratio and it's been creeping up a little bit, and I'm just wondering is there a certain level that you wouldn't want to see it go above. Mac McCullough : Yes. Peter, we don't want that to go above 100%. That's the view that we have on that. It has been creeping up a bit. We've continued to see good asset growth. And as I've mentioned, we've been a bit more conservative in terms of pricing deposits, particularly on the commercial side. So we manage that very carefully. We obviously have levers that we can pull to manage that ratio, but that would be the limit that we would have in mind. Peter Winter : Okay. And then just on the borrowing side, I guess, the $12 billion in borrowings, I was just curious, how much is floating versus fixed rate? I just want to get an idea how much could come down in cost if -- when the Fed starts cutting rates. Mac McCullough : Yes. We typically swap our debt to the floating rates, and I believe we have all the swaps to floating at this point in time. Peter Winter : Got it. That's great. Thanks, Mac. Mac McCullough : Okay. Thanks, Peter. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steven Alexopoulos : Given, I wanted to follow up on the NIM questions. So given how meaningful you increased the hedges in the quarter, the NIM kind of feels worse than expected. Even looking at the midpoint of the guidance implies considerable pressure in the back half. Mac, with the hedges in place what do you estimate the impact to NIM from every 25 basis point cut? I mean what's a reasonable range? Mac McCullough : Yes. So 25 basis point shock would be about a $24 million annual impact, so that would be a 12-month impact after a 25 basis point shock. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. That's helpful. We could work that out. Okay. And then in terms of deciding how much downward pressure to place on expense growth, is there a minimum level of positive operating leverage that you're targeting for 2019? Mac McCullough : Steven, I would say that there's not a minimum level. We're -- our target is to achieve positive operating leverage. We're very cognizant and aware of the environment, and we're very careful in terms of how we think about expense opportunities. We're continuing to invest for growth even in the metrics and the numbers that I've communicated to you today, and we feel that's an important component of being able to really create value going forward as driving the top line. We're long-term shareholders.The management team and the Board of Huntington would be in the top 10 shareholders of the company without a doubt, probably a little bit higher. So yes, they're -- it probably doesn't have the impact that you might expect to see simply because rates dropped very quickly and expectations changed very quickly. And it would've been obviously much more lucrative to put the positions on earlier, but again, we're comfortable with what we got done and feel good about how the margin is going to perform going forward. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin St. Pierre with KSP Research. Please proceed. Kevin St. Pierre: Hi, good morning. how are you doing. Mac McCullough : Good. Kevin St. Pierre: So Mac, I wanted to follow up on your comments on the customer experience and the J.D. Power awards, and THAT all sounds great. I just was wondering if you could speak to your overall mobile digital strategy. What you do in-house? What you outsource? And how that fits in with your overall branching strategy. Mac McCullough : Yes, Kevin. So we've got a real focus on making sure that from a customer experience perspective, we are investing really across many different areas of the bank, but in particular digital technology, to just improve customer experience. So we view investments like this as really driving improved customer experience, customer satisfaction and trust, that's the scorecard.We don't try to build every capability that some of the larger banks have, but we build the capabilities that we think we need that are going to drive the experience that we want for our customers. So I think that's the way we approach it, and we've allocated more and more expense every year to -- or investment every year to the digital technology and what we need to do there.So when you think about maybe a proof point for that, we rolled The Hub out, which is our new online banking platform, probably about 8 or 9 months ago. And we believe that there's a direct correlation between the vision that we have for what we wanted to try to accomplish, which was all focused on customer experience and customer satisfaction, and what we delivered with The Hub we feel actually resulted in the J.D. Power awards that we just won.So again, we don't invest in technology for technology's sake. We invest in technology to make sure that we further our strategy and our differentiation around customer experience, and I think we got a good proof point this quarter with the J.D. Power award. Kevin St. Pierre: Great. And then do you have any sense how you're doing with millennials versus older customers? Mac McCullough : We believe that we're making progress there, and I will tell you it is a real focus of ours. Clearly, we have some proof points that we believe the millennials enjoy The Hub in terms of what we deliver, and it is a focus for us. I mean, clearly, when you think about who is more likely to be changing accounts or changing banks, it's likely going to be the younger generation. And we need to have the digital capabilities that will attract them and make them feel like we're the bank for them, and that is exactly what we're trying to accomplish. So I think we continue to make good progress there. Kevin St. Pierre: Great, thank you. Mac McCullough : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks, good morning guys. Mac, on the optimization that you've been doing in the loan and securities portfolio, how much more work do you still have ahead there that you're aiming to accomplish? Or did you get effectively what you wanted to do done in the second quarter? And how do you think about, like, what buckets that would still come from if there's more? Mac McCullough : Yes. So clearly, we still have opportunity on the securities portfolio if we decided to go down that path. We think we have up to $3 billion of securities that we could take off the sheet to provide incremental funding if we go down that path. What I would tell you on the loan side is that we likely still have opportunity there. We do a lot of the work today on Excel spreadsheets and some other tools that we have to help us understand relationship profitability, but we're implementing a new application later this year that will allow us to do this in real time and actually start to have better information for relationship managers around the depth of their relationship and the profitability of their relationship and their efficiency around capital usage.So I do expect that we're going to continue to get better at this. I do think we're going to find additional opportunities. Our first preference is always to deepen the relationship and make sure that we get to a level of profitability that reflects the capital that we're allocating to that customer. But we're going to manage this appropriately, and we're going to get the right returns for our shareholders. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then just one on credit to follow up on that. So you had previously mentioned a need to rebuild the reserve. Credit is remaining very good. You're slowing loan growth in part because of the rationalization and a little bit on the competition, as you mentioned. Do you need to -- does that change the need to build the reserve at all in terms of just what you're putting on versus what you're not and the optimization underneath?Yes. Well... Mac McCullough : Yes. Go ahead. Mark Muth : I mean I think when we look at the reserve and where that is and what we do on a quarterly basis, I mean, there are things that we look at just beyond loan growth. I mean, certainly, that's a part of it. We look at the composition and the mix of the portfolio. There's a number of factors that go into the provision. Certainly, we have an eye towards keeping the provision level at a certain percentage of loans and NPAs and other criticized measurements. So I think we want to continue to look at the reserve quarterly and make sure that it's sufficient for today and going forward. Ken Usdin : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed. Brock Vandervliet : Hi, Good morning. Great. I just wanted to actually follow on that question just to kind of square the circle here. End-of-period growth -- loan growth is virtually flat. It sounds like you're cautious going forward. You've done a bit of repositioning. Should loan growth pick up a bit in the second half? Or shouldn't we expect that? Mac McCullough : No. I think you'll see loan growth pick up in the second half. I mean you have to remember when you're looking at period end, we did say 400 million off the sheet during the quarter Right? Brock Vandervliet : Yes. Mac McCullough : And -- but again, the thing that I've communicated time and time again about 2019 is the fact that we have a lot of flexibility in terms of how we manage our financials in 2019. The growth that we were expecting from the loan portfolio was not heroic on a period end to period end basis. And again, some of the liquidity that we have on the balance sheet gave us flexibility in terms of how we manage deposit pricing.And then on the expense side, we had appropriate flexibility to be able to manage the positive operating leverage for 2019. So you will see continued loan growth. The pipelines are in good shape. We're going to be cautious as we move through 2019 and understand what's going to happen from an economy perspective, but you just need to take some of those factors into consideration when you take a look at the period end numbers. Brock Vandervliet : Okay. Great. And just quickly on hedging. Earlier in the year, you had mentioned a goal of down 1% and a down 100 basis point ramp. You're 1.8% now. Obviously, the market has changed. Hedges are much more expensive. It sounds like you're not anticipating adding much more there based on the cost and based on your view of the forward curve. Is that accurate? Mac McCullough : That would be correct. We will optimize our current position, but optimize is optimize. And I would tell you that we're in good shape in terms of how we're positioned right now with our hedges. Brock Vandervliet : Great, thank you very much. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mac for closing remarks. Mac McCullough : Thank you, Sherri. I'm pleased with our solid results in the first half of the year, particularly given the significant amount of market volatility and the movement in the yield curve we have witnessed. I'm really confident about our prospects for the full year as we manage through what we expect to be a changing -- a challenging environment.Our top priorities are executing our strategic plan to prudently grow revenue and to thoughtfully invest in our businesses for continued organic growth while also delivering annual positive operating leverage. We are building long-term shareholder value through a diligent focus on top quartile financial performance and consistently disciplined risk management.And finally, as always, we'd like to end with a reminder to our shareholders that there's a high level of alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively a top 10 shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. Thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining the call today. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Mark Muth : Thank you, Sherri. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com.This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.Today\u2019s presenters are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.Let me now turn it over to Steve and he will start on Slide 3. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Mark. And thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a solid third quarter and we're pleased with the continued momentum across the bank despite a challenging operating environment.Overall, our businesses are performing well with disciplined organic growth. Credit quality remains strong and we continue to build capital while supporting organic growth. We've been positioning the bank for a weaker economy and for a lower interest rate environment throughout the year.Our efforts are consistent with our strategies of creating a high-performing regional bank delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns. We were being cautious with our capital and liquidity given mixed global economic signals as well as increased global risks and volatility.Please remember our board and management collectively are among the top 10 shareholders of the Company and we're required long-term shareholders. Across our footprint consumers continue to perform well with strong labor markets, driving wage inflation.In the 12 months ending August 2019, unemployment rates declined in 14 of the 20 largest MSAs in Huntington's footprint states. Job openings exceeded unemployment levels in most of our markets. Home prices continue to appreciate with especially solid increases in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio.Additionally, consumer confidence in our region has generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. On the business side, we've adopted a slightly more cautious view of the local economies recognizing that economic growth has slowed.We've recently seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity consistent with the more measured tone from some of our commercial customers primarily in the manufacturing sector. Near-term uncertainty around trade and the national and global economic outlook has impacted investment. The uncertainty along with the tight labor markets is constraining economic growth in our footprint.Our customers are generally confident about their performance this year. Fundamental long-term improvements are evident in virtually all footprint state economies. Michigan for example, is benefiting from a growing services sector with strong recent employment growth occurring in financial, business and professional services. Ohio has multiple industries in which long-term growth potential is high, including technology, financial services, healthcare and research.The visibility in the pipeline for the fourth quarter commercial loan growth remains good, though we are more cautious about 2020. In light of the more challenging current operating environment and the prevailing outlook for additional interest rate cuts, we\u2019ve taken action in the fourth quarter to reduce our future expense growth.We've recently completed an internal reorganization including the elimination of about 200 existing positions to better drive productivity. In addition, the build out of our agile development capabilities have allowed us to become more efficient and more effective in our technology investments, which are focused on enhancing customer experience.These actions position the bank to continue to perform well and further invest in digital technology despite an expectation of additional rate reductions. We are projecting positive operating leverage in 2020. As we've stated several times this year, we do not foresee a recession in the near-term.Our core earnings power, strong capital aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite and our long-term strategies position us to withstand economic headwinds. Our strategies are designed to drive more consistent performance across economic cycles. And while we, as I've said, we do not foresee a near term recession, it's important to recognize the downturns do not only bring challenges, they also bring opportunities. And we have a strong record of taking advantage of these situations.For example, in 2009 and 2010 when others were pulling back from auto and small business lending, we stepped in and expanded these businesses and 10-years later these two groups are key drivers of Huntington\u2019s success.Huntington was the largest SBA, 7(NYSE:A) lender in the nation last year for the second year in a row and we've now been number one in our footprint for more than a decade. Similarly, our auto finance business now operates in 23 States and we're the tenth largest bank auto lender.Also in 2010 we introduced Fair Play banking, which was quite controversial and disruptive at the time, but has fueled our consumer banking growth over the past decade. We're positioned for a more challenging economy and I'm confident in our ability to continue to build long-term shareholder value.Now, before I turn it over to Mac, I want to highlight our announcement last week that Zach Wasserman will be joining us in early November from Visa as our next CFO. As you all know earlier this year Mac announced he'll be retiring at year-end. So this is Mac\u2019s final earnings conference call before his retirement. I wanted to take a moment to thank him for his many accomplishments and enormous contributions to Huntington.Mac heightened the culture of financial discipline throughout the organization. He was instrumental in our acquisition of FirstMerit and was the executive co-lead for the integration which successfully delivered the largest acquisition in our history. Under Mac\u2019s strategic leadership, we've established our long-term financial metrics and exceeded the original set in 2014 and are now working on a current set.He has positioned the bank to perform well through all economic cycles. So on behalf of our board, our shareholders and certainly our colleagues like to thank Mac as we're extremely grateful for his contributions to the company.So Mac with that halo, let me now ask you to provide the overview of financial performance. Mac McCullough : Very good. Well thank you for those kind words, Steve. And let me say, welcome to Zack, who I'm sure is listening to the call today. Good morning to everyone on the call. And I just want to let you know how much I've enjoyed the relationship with the investment community over the last three decades.I've appreciated the friendships that we've developed and I appreciate the learning opportunities as well. So thank you very much. Let's turn to Slide 4 and take a look at the third quarter.So we have reflected strong earnings momentum with solid growth of revenue and earnings per share and a double-digit growth rate in tangible book value per share. We recorded net income of $372 million, a decrease of 2% versus the year ago quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.34 up 3% year-over-year.Tangible book value per common share was $8.25 a 17% year-over-year increase. Return on assets was 1.4%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17%.Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 54.7% down from 55.3% in the year ago quarter. Total revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Average loans increased 3% year-over-year and average core deposits increased 2% year-over-year. Net charge offs modestly increased this quarter as a result of two commercial credits, which Rich will provide more detail on later in the call.Overall credit quality remains strong. Even with these items, net charge offs were near the low-end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. As we have previously noted, we expect some quarter to quarter volatility given the very low loss in problem loans levels at which we are operating.Turning now to Slide 5, average earning assets increased $2.9 billion or 3% compared to the year ago quarter. Average loans and leases increased to $2.3 billion or 3% year-over-year including a $1.5 billion or 4% increase in commercial loans and a $0.8 billion or 2% increase in consumer loans.Average commercial and industrial loans increased 6% from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well-diversified over the past year with notable growth in corporate banking, dealer floorplan and asset finance.We also continue to see good traction in our new specialty lending verticals of mid corporate lending, technology, media and telecom and practice finance, which we announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan. Alternatively, we continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels, with average CRE loans reflecting a 3% year-over-year decrease.The decrease is an output of pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of CRE lending to ensure appropriate returns on capital and to manage risk. Consumer loan growth remain centered in the residential mortgage and RV and marine portfolios reflecting the well-managed expansion of these two businesses over the past two years.Average residential mortgage loans increased 10% year-over-year. As we typically do, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.Average RV and marine loans increased 17% year-over-year as we continue to gain traction and market share across the 34 state footprint for this business. Average auto loans decreased 2% year-over-year as a result of the auto loan pricing optimization strategy we executed in 2018 and the first half of 2019.Pricing optimization has helped us maximize revenue while minimizing balance sheet impact. However, given the changes in the interest rate outlook, we intentionally lowered our auto pricing in the third quarter to drive increased production. We are locking in short term duration, fixed-rate assets that are current higher yields before anticipated future rate cuts push auto loan yields lower next year.It is important to note that we are driving the increased production while maintaining our super prime customer focus and our consistent underwriting discipline. Auto originations in the quarter totaled $1.6 billion up 17% versus the year ago quarter and had an average FICO score above 770.Turning now to Slide 6, average total deposits increased 1% year-over-year, while average core deposits increased 2% year-over-year. Note that we sold approximately $725 million of core deposits as part of the sale that was constant retail branch network in June of this year.Average money market deposits increased 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the shift in promotional pricing away from CDs to consumer money market accounts in mid-2018.Core certificates of deposits increased 15% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the consumer CD growth initiatives during the third quarter of 2018. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 1% year-over-year, while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 2%. Average total demand deposits were flat year-over-year.As shown on Slide 30 in the appendix, we are very pleased that our consumer noninterest-bearing deposits increased 3% year-over-year. We continue to see our commercial customers shift balances from noninterest-bearing DDA to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market. Average savings and other domestic deposits decreased 15%, primarily reflecting a continued shift in consumer product mix.Moving on to Slide 7. FTE net interest income decreased $5 million or 1% versus the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the 12 basis points decline in net interest margin, partially offset by the 3% increase in average earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.20% for the quarter, down 12 basis points from the year ago quarter and down 11 basis points linked-quarter.Moving to Slide 8, our core net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.16%, down nine basis points from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed four basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter, compared to seven basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 26 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020.Turning to the earning asset yields. Our commercial loan yields decreased five basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 18 basis points. Security yields increased one basis point. Our deposit costs remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 98 basis points for the quarter, up 25 basis points year-over-year and up only one basis point sequentially. Our total interest-bearing deposit costs peaks in July and have moved lower every month since.Slide 9 summarizes the incremental hedging strategy we have implemented to reduce the downside risk from lower interest rates. The incremental hedges include both asset swaps and floors. We have now substantially completed implementation of the incremental hedges. However, as you should expect, we will continue to fine-tune the overall hedging program as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate. It's also important to remember that the cost of the hedging program has been fully reflected in our guidance since late 2018.The graphs on the bottom left of the slide provide detail and the mix of our loan portfolio as well as the significant consumer deposit balances with repricing events in the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020. This provides an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposits as these well-timed, higher priced CDs and promotional money market accounts repriced lower.Through September, the deposit repricing activity is on track, although the maturing balances pick up in the fourth quarter, given this timing, we expect to see the impact of the lower consumer deposit costs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019. On the commercial side of the business, we've developed tactics to quickly react to any rate cuts with client-specific rate reductions, particularly among our highest cost deposits. We were very pleased with the results following the July and September rate cuts and are ready to implement the same strategy for any future rate cuts.Slide 10 provides detail on our noninterest income which increased 14% from the year ago quarter. Mortgage banking income increased 74%, primarily reflecting higher secondary market spreads and favorable origination volume as well as an $8 million gain on net mortgage servicing rate, risk managements in the current quarter.Capital markets fees increased 38% versus the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey and Erley in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continued core business growth. We continue to see positive momentum within our two largest contributors to noninterest income as deposit service charges and card and payment processing fees both posted year-over-year growth.Slide 11 provides the components of the 2% year-over-year growth in noninterest expense. Personnel costs increased 5%, primarily reflecting a shift in the composition of colleagues, including the addition of nearly 200 colleagues in our digital and technology areas related to the 2018 strategic plan initiatives and the hiring of experienced bankers in our new lending verticals.Further increasing personnel expense year-over-year with the implementation of annual merit increases in May of 2019 and increased benefit costs. Outside data processing and other services increased 26% year-over-year, driven by ongoing technology investment costs. Partially offsetting these increases, deposit and other insurance expense decreased 56% due to the discontinuation of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018, while other expense decreased 16%.We remain focused on driving positive operating leverage in 2019 and 2020. Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios, the tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 8%, up 75 basis points from a year ago quarter. For the common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.02%, up 13 basis points year-over-year and up 14 basis points linked-quarter. We continue to manage CET1 to the high-end of our 9% to 10% operating guidelines. During the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased 5.2 million common shares at an average cost of $13.02 per share or a total of $68 million of common stock.Slide 13 provides a look at our current thinking around CECL. We continue to progress towards CECL implementation in 2020. At this time, we estimate our allowance for credit losses or ACL will increase in a range of 40% to 50% from current levels. Given our 50% mix of relatively longer dated consumer loans, the CECL lifetime loss methodology results in a much higher allowance than the current expected loss methodology. The increase in reserves has predominantly correlated to the consumer loan portfolio.We reduced our buyback this quarter as we worked through the expected impact of CECL. Going forward, we plan to use the share repurchase to manage our capital costs, our capital post-CECL back to 10% CET1 level, but a fully implemented basis by the end of next year. These actions reinforce our commitment to maintaining our strong capital ratios which we see as a position of strength for the organization.As we have previously communicated on many instances our capital priorities are : first, to fund organic growth; second, to support the cash dividends and finally, all other capital uses including the buyback and selective acquisitions. These capital priorities have not changed.Let me now turn it over to Rich to cover the credit trends for the quarter. Rich? Rich Pohle : Thanks Mac. Slide 14 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter which remains strong. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.We booked loan loss provision expense of $82 million in the third quarter and net charge-offs of $73 million. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 39 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 25 basis points in the prior quarter and up from 16 basis points in the year ago quarter. The increase was centered on two specific energy credit relationships which made up nearly three-fourth of the total commercial net charge-offs.These relationships were upstream companies operating in the same reserve basin. One of the credits was moved to held-for-sale, which accounts for the increase in other NPAs for the quarter. We expect the sale to close in the next couple of weeks. The loss exposure in these two credits was completely recognized in the third quarter.We have a relatively small energy portfolio representing less than 2% of total loans. Consumer charge-offs have remained consistent over the past year. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses or ALLL, as a percentage of loans remained relatively stable at 1.05%, up two basis points linked-quarter. The nonperforming asset ratio increased three basis points linked-quarter and nine basis points year-over-year to 0.64%. The year-over-year increases was centered in the C&I portfolio and other NPAs, partially offset by decreases in the residential mortgage, commercial real estate and home equity portfolios.Note that these metrics include the results from the most recent shared national credit exam. The increase in commercial delinquencies this quarter as seen in the appendix on Slide 54 was related to a leasing system conversion, not underlying credit deterioration. Overall, asset quality metrics remain near cyclical lows. And as we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans.Let me turn it back over to Mac. Mac McCullough : Thank you, Rich. Slide 15 illustrates our updated expectations for full year 2019. We expect full year average loan growth of approximately 4% with continued growth in our consumer business, including home lending and auto finance. We expect more measured commercial loan growth consistent with recent economic data.Full year average deposit growth is expected to be approximately 3% as we remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. A number of you have asked for us to provide guidance on net interest income as opposed to NIM, which we are now providing on the slide.We expect full year fully taxable equivalent net interest income growth of approximately 1% for 2019. This is consistent with a full year 2019 margin guidance we provided at the Barclays conference and includes the impact from purchase accounting and the cost of our hedging strategy.Also, as I mentioned at the Barclays conference, we remain comfortable with current Street consensus expectation for full year 2020 NIM of 3.21%. We expect full year noninterest income growth of 9% to 12% on a GAAP basis. As we have told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions, we've remained committed to delivering annual positive operating leverage. Full year noninterest expenses are expected to increase 2% to 2.5%.This includes approximately net $15 million to $20 million of unusual expense resulting from the previously mentioned expense actions we are taking in the fourth quarter. As we have done in the past, we are also evaluating our branches and other real estate. We anticipate that full year 2019 net charge-offs will remain below or average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range.So with that Sherri, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Mac McCullough : Hi Erika. Erika Najarian : Thank you so much for reiterating your outlook on that net interest margin for next year. And I'm wondering if we could put it in context of balance sheet growth as well. The loan growth momentum continues to be solid. And I'm wondering, how should we think about, how you're thinking about A, your resi growth strategy in a post-CECL world and B, how earning asset growth will trend relative to loan growth from here? Mac McCullough : Yes, thanks, Erika. We're not going to give 2020 guidance until later this year at a conference in December. But happy to answer your questions around resi growth and how we're thinking about going forward. We will be cautious with resi growth on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously we have a number of our customers who have the need for that product. A number of the balances that we've been putting on in 2019 have been private plan relationship that we have a deep relationship with and that's how we're thinking about mortgage product going forward.Just given some of the changes in CECL work, we're looking for that to be more of a relationship product from a relationship pricing perspective. But still like the asset class but that might be the one change that we think about going forward. Erika Najarian : I guess just in net-net, if we take a step back, unless you tell us something more dramatic in terms of how you're managing the securities portfolio. If I combine your outlook on margin with, let's call it 3% to 4% loan growth, then it seems as if the net interest income growth would be sort of greater than the flat trend than what consensus is expecting. Mac McCullough : Clearly, the net interest income growth in 2020 will be driven by earning asset growth. We are seeing growth switch from the commercial categories to the consumer categories in the fourth quarter. We will likely continue to be more aggressive of consumer lending in 2020 as we like the dynamics of those portfolios, if you think about some of the fixed rate nature of the portfolios as well as the credit quality. We continue to super-prime consumer portfolio, so that's one change, just given some of the comments we made about the outlook for commercial lending and what we're seeing now that you could expect to see in 2020. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you and congratulations, Mac. Mac McCullough : Okay. Thank you, Erika. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed. Mac McCullough : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi good morning. Hey, good morning and then best of luck to you again, Mac. On the deposit side, you mentioned that you'd expect the deposits to start coming down in the fourth. They were up a touch in the quarter. Can you just walk us through the dynamics of the rolling off legacy CDs and how much impact you can see that have on total interest-bearing cost as you do roll forward? Thanks. And beta \u2013 just kind of your underlying beta expectations. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Yes, thanks Ken. So the opportunities we have with the CD book that\u2019s repricing and some of the money market specials that are also coming up for re-evaluation. I mean, it actually presents a really nice opportunity for us. I think Slide 9 actually has the mix of what's repricing from a deposit perspective and you can see that we're actually entering into some of the bigger balance changes in the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2020.As I mentioned in my opening comments, we've seen really good execution against being able to reprice those deposits. I would say, it's ahead of our expectations. We are seeing some of the CDs move into money market, because of just some late specials that we have in the money market space. But we still like that activity as it retains those deposits and allows us to reprice lower.The one good trend that continues to play out well for us is the continued growth in noninterest-bearing on the consumer side, still really good activity there. And we don't see that slowing down. So, all in all, I think the timing of when we put some of these deposits on our books in 2018 and the opportunity as we see the declining rate environment is what really gives us some confidence as we move into the fourth quarter with our ability to reprice these deposits and help to stabilize the NIM. Ken Usdin : Got it. Steve Steinour : I think the sale of Wisconsin was little over $100 million of DDA as well, so the year-over-year numbers even more impressive. Mac McCullough : Yes, good point. So the $725 million that we sold with Wisconsin those were our core deposits as Steve called out the DDA portion. So our performance needs to take into consideration that $725 million that we sold as a part of the Wisconsin branch sale. Ken Usdin : Yes. And just one clarification, you always do guide on GAAP. So I'm presuming that the $15 million to $20 million of non-core stuff in the fourth quarter, that's in the full-year guidance? Mac McCullough : Absolutely Ken. That's a good call-out and a good margin of what the guidance\u2026 Ken Usdin : All right. And we should see the benefits of that next year then? Mac McCullough : That's correct. Ken Usdin : All right, thank you. Mac McCullough : Okay. Thanks Ken. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Jon Arfstrom : Good morning. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Mac, I wonder what you\u2019re going to be doing in mid-January not thinking about margin guidance? Mac McCullough : I will be lonely. Jon Arfstrom : Your last chance to do what\u2019s right. Mac McCullough : Now what does that imply, Jon? Jon Arfstrom : Yes. Noninterest income growth, it's a pretty wide range that you have for the full year. And I'm thinking if mortgage is the variance there but can you just help us understand the wide range and what would drive us \u2013 drive you to the lower, higher end of the range? Mac McCullough : Yes, that's absolutely correct, Jon. I mean, we continue to see good mortgage origination volume and the favorable spreads are holding up nicely. So we don't know exactly how strong the quarter is going to be, but we do think there could be some upside there. And that's why we gave it. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. And is the origination strategy I understand a lot of it is this quarter was MSR and maybe some refinance, but the origination strategy is still more Chicago focused or is there something more than that driving it? Mac McCullough : Well, it is broadly across the franchise, but I do think some of the changes that we made in Chicago and particular as we acquired FirstMerit and built out the mortgage origination capabilities in the Chicago market, a lot of the growth has been coming out of Chicago since FirstMerit. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, all right. Thank you. Mark Muth : We also do a lot of strengthen both here in Michigan \u2013 in Ohio and Michigan post-FirstMerit. So don't want to downplay that impact either. Jon Arfstrom : But it's safe to say that it's just \u2013 it's refinancing volume that's going to drive you to the higher end or lower end that's really it? Mark Muth : Yes, that's exactly a way to look at it. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, thank you. Mark Muth : Okay, thanks Jon. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please proceed. Brian Foran : Hi, good morning everyone. Mac McCullough : Good morning, Brian. Brian Foran : I guess, Steve, you mentioned you don't see a recession on the horizon, but you also kind of made some cautious comments on the commercial side. I mean, you've seen several cycles. I'm just wondering, is that something that can persist or is it kind of like one or the other has to win, i.e., can we have a prolonged period of a slump in commercial lending without a recession or is it kind of like if C&I stays weaker for longer eventually that tips in a recession, and if we don't tip in recession, then eventually C&I recovers? Steve Steinour : Right. In the commercial context, there are a lot of avenues for financing in addition to banking. Historically, it would have said reduced bank lending would naturally translate into slower economic growth, but you do have many other options out there today for different levels of commercial customers.I think what we're trying to suggest is that the combination of factors that have occurred somewhat more in the late first half and certainly the second half of the year have compounded the outlook a bit. So whether it's global slowdown, trade and tariffs, we have a big manufacturing sector and an export sector here in the Midwest states we're in.Just as we mentioned in the last call, we're almost talking ourselves into this. So I think a number of factors are contributing to a slowdown and we still see it as a slowdown. Many of our customers continue to suggest their number one issue is they can get qualified employees. And so this is a labor constrained recovery that has lost a little steam but we think it continues. Brian Foran : And then maybe one follow-up on the expense side. Can you remind us in kind of a normal year, how much expense flexibility do you have? So I'm not trying to get into a number for 2020. But just if you're trying to ramp up or ramp down expenses based on the environment, but also trying to make the core investments you want to make in the franchise. As the year progresses, is the range plus or minus 2% or 200 basis points, 400 basis points? How much ability do you have to react in a typical year? Mac McCullough : Yes, Brian, this is Mac. So we do believe that we have expense flexibility and I think we've proven that as we move through what's important with the economy and the interest rate outlook. We still have some flexibility. We go through the process every year of taking a look at just different levels of productivity improvements that we put in place before the year ends, so that we know where we're going to go in case we have to think through some changes in the environments and how we want to manage things like operating leverage or EPS or investment back into the franchise.So it's important that as we think about what opportunities we have on the expense side in 2020, as we manage for positive operating leverage. We're also investing back into the franchise. And I think that's really important for us to recognize in terms of the activities that we're going through and some of the important investments that Steve has spoken to that we're going to continue to make in 2020.So confident that we've got flexibility, in addition to what we've already done. But we're going to be careful about the overall health of the franchise and we're going to continue to make those important investments that we think will drive the top line and our competitive position going forward. Brian Foran : Thank you both, and Mac, congratulations. Mac McCullough : Yes. Thank you, Brian. Steve Steinour : Thanks Brian. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. How are you? Mark Muth : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hey, Mac, I guess first question, just sort of on kind of a qualitative one on the balance between the margin and the overall dollars of NII. Do you guys sort of have one that you kind of prefer to manage to over the other? So I think in the past as you guys have looked at some of the levers you have to pull on the margin, you've alluded to some of the \u2013 some marginality in the securities portfolio for example. How do you sort of weigh that balance between preserving the dollars and preserving the margin rate?And then I guess, along those lines, as we look at the mix shift into next year, relatively more consumer-driven vis-\u00e0-vis commercial. Is that going to have any discernible impact on the margin trajectory from you guys' standpoint? Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks, Scott. So in this environment and just based upon feedback we've gotten from analysts and investors, we did make the switch over to net interest income in terms of providing guidance in this quarter. Obviously, with some of the volatility in the marketplace as well as some of the actions that we can take to drive net interest income that will have an impact on NIM, that might necessarily tell the whole story by us just giving you the NIM guidance.Yes. So to your point, Scott, you alluded to the levers that we have in terms of how we think about driving net interest income and that would be things like the securities portfolio, optimization of the balance sheet. There are many players that we've run over the years that we still have in our pocket that we can take a look at and those actions have an impact on NIM obviously.So going forward, we're managing net interest income and we're managing the revenue profile of the company. NIM is a bit of an output from that as we move through what is increasingly more volatile period. But we think that gives you the best information you need to understand where we think the organization is going. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you for that. And then I think I'm effectively going to repeat one of the other questions here but just so I understand it perfectly. On the cost side, all of that difference in the guidance today versus what you gave a month or so ago at the Barclays conference, that's simply a function of the sort of one-time costs that we're going to have in the fourth quarter as opposed to any change in the core trajectory, right? Mac McCullough : Yes. That is exactly correct. Scott Siefers : Okay, terrific. All right. Well, thank you again. And then Mac, good luck and congratulations. Mac McCullough : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Mark Muth : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. On the expense topic again for, I know you're not giving formal guidance for 2020, but you did indicate that you're confident and positive operating leverage or you're projecting it for 2020 as well. Is there any way you can help us with the magnitude and \u2013 or at least a little bit of color that \u2013 could operating leverage actually accelerate off of the 2019 amount that you're going to see because of the headcount reductions in the hedging that's in place? Thanks. Mark Muth : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. So the way we think about expense growth and what we're trying to accomplish is we understand the revenue environment that we're moving into. And once we get some confidence around a range of revenue expectations then we decide what we can do from an expense perspective including investment back into the franchise.So, well, I can't and won't give you any guidance around expense for 2020. We are targeting positive operating leverage as Steve mentioned in his comments. We're also looking to reinvest back in the franchise as I mentioned in my comments and Steve's comments.So the activity is underway and what we've done up to this point in time, give us a path to both of those objectives, making the right investments back into the franchise and achieving positive operating leverage.If we get ahead in 2020, it's more likely we're going to invest back in the franchise taking everything else into consideration, the revenue outlook obviously where the economy is and where we think its heading and what we think our performance is going to be in those scenarios. But we've got some investments underway that we think are differentiating and important and we're going to continue to make those investments. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on the credit side, I know you mentioned that you implied that one of the energy credits had impacted other NPAs, so that accounted for some of the increased in non-accruals, but \u2013 in NPAs. But non-accruals also saw, it looks like an additional increase. So I just want to get a little bit of color about what may have driven that and also your criticized assets were up a bunch. Is that all the NPA increase or is there something else there that's driving them higher? Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes, I mean the quick class number is up. It's not at a level that, we haven\u2019t operated at before, we've been back at this level in the 2016, 2017 timeframe. The current quarter does have some energy impacts in there as well. As it relates to the NPAs, we did move the one deal into held-for-sale and then we had a couple of additional NPAs added, one in energy and then one, a couple of others outside of energy more on the C&I side. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. And the other stuff on the C&I side, was that in any specific sector outside of energy? Rich Pohle : No, it was pretty broad based, a couple of middle market credits and we're in there. John Pancari : Okay. So no other deterioration non-energy to flag that you're starting to see developed in the portfolio? Rich Pohle : No, I mean, the energy represented a significant amount of the charge-offs for the quarter. If you were to exclude the energy losses, which you can't do, but the rest of the book on the commercial side, the charge offs were pretty de minimis. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks Rich, and Mac good luck. Mac McCullough : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Conner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Matt O\u2019Conner: Hey guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning Matt. Matt O\u2019Conner: I was wondering if you could talk as far as you could talk a bit more about the drivers of the good growth in both service charges and card fees as we look year-over-year. I mean, you addressed kind of continued growth from a more activity, but they're obviously both for us, rates are quite high and maybe give us a little color on, on the service charges, how much is commercial or consumer and again, the sustainability of both of those growth rates. Thanks. Mac McCullough : Yes. Thanks, Matt. So the good news here is that I can't really call it anything unusual that's driving the growth, other than just good execution and organic growth. When you take a look at deposit service charges, we are seeing growth in consumer because we continue to add new households to the organization.Commercial is probably being driven by treasury management to a large degree and some of the new products and services that we've implemented. In particular, we've added some new capabilities in the business banking, our small business side, that have had a nice lift and kind of a pipeline for treasury management revenue as well as close one referrals.So that is a very, very nice developing trend that we think is going to continue into 2020. And payment processing, I would just tell you that's a good core organic growth in terms of new customers coming into the bank, new card, debit and credit opportunities, And it's just basically the growth of our customers organically.Capital Markets is another item to call out, which again we continue to see really, really good growth, good execution. We continue to add up the products out there. We bought the broker dealer, municipal broker dealer last year and that has really been very complementary to our Capital Markets business. We've been able to leverage that acquisition into some of our other capabilities and business lines to actually see additional growth coming out of that opportunity.So we've got some good performance in fee products in 2019. I think there are some good reasons to believe that's going to continue in 2020. Matt O\u2019Conner: Just back on the service charges. Have you guys disclosed what the mix is between the consumer and commercial? And I guess does a commercial benefit from the declining rate environment here on the earnings credits the way it works versus your fees versus your earnings credit on deposits? Mac McCullough : Yes. So the mix is probably slightly more toward the consumer side, but we haven't really disclosed the exact breakout between the two. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question? Matt O\u2019Conner: Just the outlook on the commercial. Is there some benefit from the lower rates there as the earnings credit on deposits are less and you've picked up in fees that one is the driver as you think about next year? Mac McCullough : Yes, I wouldn't think that earnings credit is going to be a big addition to that line going forward in 2020. I mean we manage earnings credit pretty tightly. But I don't think that's going to be a big driver. Matt O\u2019Conner: Okay, all right. Thank you. Mac McCullough : Okay. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. MarkMuth: Morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe : Great, thanks. I guess maybe Steve, I know in your initial comments, it sounds like you're pretty negative on commercial loan growth. I just want make sure we get the right message that is it that commercial loan growth in 2020 could slow, but you're going to more or at least make up the slowness with better consumer growth, is that the right message? Steve Steinour : Well, I want to imply a cautiousness. The economy has slowed significantly year-over-year. We were running around 3.5% to 1.5% most recently. We've done 6% year-over-year commercial growth, and I think we need to be a little more cautious. We're just trying to flag that for you in line with the outlook that we're hearing from our customers. We expect to be able to grow commercial next year and at the same time, we will grow the consumer side as well. Ken Zerbe : Got you. Okay. And then I guess just one small question in terms of your guidance for positive operating leverage in 2019, is that on a full GAAP basis? Are you excluding the unusually high expenses in fourth quarter? Steve Steinour : Yes. It's all on a GAAP basis. Ken Zerbe : Okay, all right, great. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steven Alexopoulos : Good morning, everybody. Steve Steinour : Hi, Steve. Steven Alexopoulos : I wanted to drill down a little bit on CECL. How much is the reserve for auto loans expected to change under CECL? Mac McCullough : So Steve, we're not going to give that level of guidance at this point in time. We'll disclose those stats, obviously in the future, but I'm not going to disclose them here. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Is it material enough to change your appetite to want to add auto loans in 2020? Mac McCullough : No. Steven Alexopoulos : No. Okay. And then separately for Steve. In terms of the tone-shift you're talking about from your manufacturing customers, is this more coming from the macro noise right trade wars, etcetera. Are you starting to actually see pressure start to show up in financial statements for these customers? Steve Steinour : We're total at this point, Steven we, again, I think there is an element of we're talking ourselves into something but certainly for these manufacturers, the trade tariff issues are real, for some of them. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. And what percent of your loans are to manufacturing companies? Mac McCullough : Commercial loans of about 25% to ballpark. Steven Alexopoulos : That's of commercial. Mac McCullough : Yes. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, thanks and best of luck, Mac. Thanks very much. Mac McCullough : Yes. Thank you. Take care. Operator : Our next question is from David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed. Mark Muth : Hi, Dave. David Long : Good morning everyone. Mac, I think you said that you were comfortable just maybe confirm if this is accurate, but I thought I heard you say you're comfortable with the Street NIM forecast of 321 for 2020. Is that accurate? Mac McCullough : That is correct. David Long : Okay, just when you say that, what type of rate backdrop do you have in mind? How many rate cuts do you have in or what are your expectations when making that comment? Mac McCullough : Yes, it's great, great question, Dave. So we have a assumption of three rate cuts, October, January and September. David Long : Got it, got it. Okay, great, that's all that I had. Mac McCullough : Okay, thanks Dave. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed. Marty Mosby : Thanks. MarkMuth: Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask \u2013 hey, good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the return on tangible common equity and how you're looking at the different stacks of capital. Your CET1 ratio is relatively flat but your TCE to TA ratio has been increasing over the last year pretty substantially.I know that some of that's related to mark-to-market on the securities portfolio. But I wouldn't think that all of that was the difference there. So, we're just curious because that increase in TCE to TA ratio was causing the ROTCE to fall off a little bit. Mac McCullough : Yes, Marty. It's a great, great question. So we're up about $1 billion year-over-year in tangible common equity. About 75% of it is OCI related to the securities portfolio and other pension, things like that. So that is the primary driver of the improvement in TCE. Marty Mosby : And then could you give us a little bit of color on the mortgage servicing rights? We've had several banks report these gains in the mortgage servicing rights with the hedging given that interest rates were coming down and prepayments were kicking in. It's one of two things. Either the assumption on the prepays was over exaggerated, which I think is built into the models all the time in the or you are over-hedged. So I'm just curious how the dynamics were playing out. So this particular quarter, we had these gains on mortgage servicing rights hedging. Mac McCullough : Yes, Marty. It's obviously been a pretty volatile environment. Then I would say it's a little of both in terms of the two suspects you threw out there. But volatility has been pretty, pretty high as you, as you know, but I think the team has done a great job of making sure that we are hedged appropriately and some of that volatility is going to mean that you are over hedged, under hedged at any point of time.But it's obviously something we look at very carefully, spend a lot of time with and I think we've done a good job. Marty Mosby : Well, thanks and best of luck where you'd go forward, it's been great working with you. Mac McCullough : I appreciate it Marty. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed. Mark Muth : Hi, Brock. Brock Vandervliet : Great, good morning. On the credit picture and I know you provide a lifetime net charge-off over the cycle guide, I guess over the cycle guide. I'm a little surprised that some of the credit friction this quarter, what kind of confidence do you have based on what you can see right now that you can hold net charge-offs and kind of the level that we saw this quarter as opposed to having them move higher in the intermediate term? Rich Pohle : This is Rich. Like I said, the charge-offs in this quarter were really isolated to the energy book. The balance of the portfolio, we believe is performing well and we have expectations that it will continue to perform well. So if you're trying to, are you trying to tie that into the CECL estimate or \u2026 Brock Vandervliet : Not so much around CECL, just trying to get a sense of, I felt like Huntington has been kind of battened down for quite a while on credit and just it sounds like there is more a tone of slowing and I just want to make sure I'm attuned to that. That's all. Mac McCullough : Yes. So I think it's important to differentiate the slowing with the credit discussion. We talked about energy be less than 2% of our loan portfolio and that really is where the problems have been centered. Outside of that, we really don't see anything of concern as we take a look at the portfolios on the outlooks.So it's different, I think a different, different discussion on what we see in the economy and what we hear from our customers and a little bit of caution around some of the feedback we're getting in, some of what we're seeing take place on the ground. But that's how I would think about the credit question versus what we see it and from a growth perspective. Rich Pohle : And to be clear Brock, we're not making a call on a recession, we don't see it. I think we reiterated that twice in the prepared comments. So this is a 1.5% which, you roll the clock back six years ago would have been a reasonably good year. So we're just coming off of 3.5% and it's a percent GDP growth. So we think this we could be, we could be running at this level for a while. Mac McCullough : And to your earlier point Brock, I mean, look, we're not going to put question of assets on the balance sheet at this point of the cycle. So we've been consistent in talking about the discipline of our underwriting process. I think we're even more cautious in environments like this based on what we're hearing from our customers. So we put a note of caution out there and we've talked about the pipeline still being higher than they were at this time last year, but we're just reflecting what we hear from our customers and letting you know what we're thinking. Brock Vandervliet : Okay. I appreciate the color. Mac McCullough : Okay, thanks Brock. Operator : And our final question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed. Peter Winter : Good morning. Mac McCullough : Hey Peter. Peter Winter : I had a question on capital. And I heard you with the share buybacks being at the bottom of your packing order. But I'm just curious, are you planning on completing the share authorization under the 2019 CCAR? Mac McCullough : Peter, it's going to depend on balance sheet growth from here and outlook for 2020. We are committed to getting our capital levels back to the pre-CECL levels by the end of 2020 which could mean that we curtail the 2019 share repurchase authorization a bit but it's all going to come down to a balance sheet growth and what it's going to take you back to those levels at the end of 2020. Peter Winter : Got it, okay. Thanks and Mac I've enjoyed working with you over the year. So, best of luck. Mac McCullough : Thank you, Peter. Operator : I would like to now turn the conference back over to Steve for closing comments. Steve Steinour : So, I'm pleased with our solid results through the first three quarters of 2019, particularly given the significant movement in the yield curve and the amount of market volatility we've witnessed. I remain confident about our prospects for the remainder of the year in 2020 as we manage through what we expect to be a challenging environment.Our top priorities are executing our strategic plan and thoughtfully investing in our businesses for continued prudent organic growth while delivering the annual positive operating leverage. We're building long-term shareholder value by focusing on customers and top quartile financial performance with consistently disciplined risk management.And finally, we always like to end with a reminder to our shareholders that there is a high level of alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively at top 10 shareholder of Huntington and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance.So with that, thank you for your interest in Huntington. Mac many thanks to you, and congratulations. We appreciate all of you joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thank you. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded, and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time, and are subject to changes, risks, and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, and the material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings.Let me now turn it over to Steve, who will start on slide three. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We're pleased with our full-year 2019 results and the continued momentum across the bank, despite a challenging operating environment.For the full-year, we reported earnings per common share of $1.27, an increase of 6% over 2018. Return on average assets for 2019 was 1.3%. Return on average common equity was 13%, and return on average tangible common equity was 17%. The bank achieved record net income for the fifth consecutive year and positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year. Our balance sheet is very well-positioned with robust capital and liquidity, and our comprehensive hedging strategy has reduced interest rate risk. Credit quality remains strong with 2019 net charge-offs at the low-end of our average through the cycle target range. We remain prudent with our allocation of capital to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risks, consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. 2019 marked the ninth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend, coupling the dividend with $441 million of share repurchases during the year. We returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in 2019, which represented a total payout ratio of 79%.As we previously communicated on many instances, our capital priorities are first to fund organic growth, second, to support the cash dividends, and finally, all other capital uses including the buyback and selective acquisitions. These capital priorities have not changed.Now, moving to the economy, we continue to see growth and our expectation for 2020 is for continued expansion. Consumers continue to perform well across our footprint with strong labor markets driving wage inflation. In the 12 months ending November 2019, unemployment rates declined or remain the same in 17 of the 20 largest MSAs in Huntington's footprint states. Job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in the Midwest. Home prices continue to appreciate with especially solid increases in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. Additionally, consumer confidence in our region has generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. The positive consumer sentiment is evident in the success of our consumer lending businesses. Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for both full-year 2019 and the 2019 fourth quarter. Our auto finance business also achieved record originations in the fourth quarter, and we expect another good year in 2020 for our consumer lending businesses, again driven primarily by residential mortgage and auto finance.Now, we have seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity consistent with the measured tone from some of our commercial customers. Economic uncertainty along with tight labor markets remain headwinds for more robust economic growth in our footprint. Overall, Huntington is performing well with disciplined organic growth. Our customers are generally confident about their performance for 2020, and we share that confidence in our performance. We continue to see good traction in our new specialty lending verticals of mid-corporate lending, technology, media and telecom, our practice finance area, which we announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan.Looking out to 2020, we proactively took actions in the fourth quarter to drive organic revenue growth, reduce our future expense growth, and increase our capacity for additional investment in our businesses and technology. We reposition $2 billion of securities picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities. The rebalance resulted in $22 million of security losses in the fourth quarter.On the expense side, we completed the position reduction of employees and announced the consolidation of 30 in-store branches, and these actions along with the disposition of other properties and a technology system decommission resulted in unusual expense of approximately $25 million in the quarter. Our disciplined expense management allows for further investment in digital and mobile technology, and enterprise growth initiatives going forward. I'm confident in our positioning entering 2020, and our colleagues are focused and executing our plans. We are all aligned with our strategies of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns.Zach will now provide an overview of our financial performance. Zach? Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning everybody. It's a pleasure to be with you here on my first earnings call with Huntington. Slides four and five provide highlights of our full-year 2019 and fourth quarter 2019 results respectively, many of which Steve already touched on. Fourth quarter results include approximately $47 million of pre-tax impact, or approximately $0.03 per share after-tax from previously announced actions that were taken to better position the bank for 2020, including the securities repositioning, workforce actions, and the pending in-store branch closures.Let's turn to slide six to discuss the key fundamental drivers behind the financial performance for the quarter. Average earning assets increased $2.3 billion, or 2%, compared to the year ago quarter. Average loans and leases increased $1.3 billion, or 2% year-over-year with balanced consumer and commercial loan growth. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 3% from the year ago quarter, and reflected the largest component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well-diversified over the past year with notable growth in specialty banking, asset finance, and corporate banking. Our fourth quarter commercial loan growth was below our expectations. As a portion of yields we expected to close at the end of the year were pushed into 2020 and seasonal declines in line utilization at year-end were larger than normal. Overall commercial activity continues to be restrained by economic uncertainty.We continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average CRE loans reflecting a 2% year-over-year decrease, driven by pay downs and refinancing activity. Consumer loan growth remained focused in the residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting robust origination in the second-half of 2019. Average residential mortgage loans increased 7% year-over-year. As we typically do, we sold the agency-qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retain jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.Now, turning to slide seven, average total deposits decreased less than 1% year-over-year, while average core deposits increased 1% year-over-year. Note that both of these growth rates were negatively impacted by the June 2019 sale of the Wisconsin Retail Branch Network, including approximately $725 million or almost 1% of core deposits. We continue to see a migration in deposit balances from CDs and savings into money market accounts, reflecting shifting customer preferences, and where we are focused on promotional pricing. Average money market deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while savings decreased 9%, and core CDs decreased 16%. We expect this dynamic to continue in 2020. Average non-interest bearing and interest bearing DDA accounts, each increased 1% year-over-year. As shown on slide 32 in the appendix, we're very pleased that our commercial non-interest bearing deposit increased 5% year-over-year on the quarter. This growth highlights our continued focus on growing our low cost deposit base through new customer acquisition and relationship deepening.Moving now to slide eight, FTE net interest income decreased $55 million or 7% versus a year ago quarter, primarily driven by the 29 basis point decline in net interest margin partially offset by 2% increase in average earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.12% for the quarter, down 29 basis points from the year ago quarter, down eight basis points link quarter. And in line with the guidance we provided the Goldman Sachs conference in December.Moving to slide nine, our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3.08%, down 26 basis points from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion have contributed four basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter, compared to seven basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 28 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of first merit purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020. Please note that this quarter is the last quarter we intend to write core NIM and PAA breakouts, as the PAA is expected to have a relatively immaterial impact in 2020.Turning to asset to earning asset yield, our commercial loan yields decreased 52 basis points year-over-year, consumer loan yields decreased eight basis points and security yields decreased 16 basis points. The decrease in our earning asset yields can be primarily attributed to lower interest rates following the three Federal Reserve rate reductions that occurred during 2019. On the funding side of the balance sheet, our deposit costs continue to move lower. As CDs and money market promotional rates re-price lower, and we actively manage commercial deposit costs. Total interest bearing deposit costs of 87 basis points for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year. So down 11 basis points sequentially.Slide 10 summarizes the actions we've taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and the lower interest rate environment. Our hedging strategies reduced the downside risk for lower interest rates and have significantly narrowed the band of modeled outcomes for net interest income. Our current interest rate risk modeling suggests little changed in interest income from either a 25 basis point increase, or 25 basis points decrease in 2020. We continuously monitor and will continue to prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate.The graphs on the bottom left of the slide detail the mix of our loan portfolio, as well as the significant consumer deposit balances with re-pricing events in the first-half of 2020. These re-pricing events provide an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposit, as these higher price CDs and promotional money market accounts re-price lower. Through December, the consumer deposit re-pricing activity is on track with our expectations. The success of our consumer depository pricing and retention has provided us the ability to remain more disciplined in our commercial deposit pricing, particularly among the highest cost deposits. The graph on the bottom right of the slide displays the impact of our actions. You can see the downward trajectory of our total interest bearing deposit costs by month since July. We expect this trend to continue given the significant deposit re-pricing opportunities that remain in the first-half of 2020.Turning to slide 11, you can see it provides the detail on our non-interest income, which increased 13% from the year ago quarter. The growth was highlighted by mortgage banking income, which increased 152%, primarily reflecting higher saleable origination volume and secondary market spreads, as well as a $12 million increase in the gain on net mortgage servicing rights risk management. We also continue to see steady growth in card and payment processing income, trust and investment management and insurance. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we repositioned $2 billion of securities picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities prospectively at a cost of $22 million in Q4, while negatively impacting four quarter results, the prospective earnings pick up and the earn back on the positioning losses are very attractive and consistent with our active management of the securities portfolio. The year ago quarter in 2018 included $19 million of securities losses from similar repositioning.Slide 12 provides the components of the 1% year-over-year decrease in non-interest expense. The 2019 fourth quarter included $25 million of expense related to the actions, which Steve discussed earlier, while the year ago quarter included $35 million of similar branch and facility consolidation-related expense. Adjusting for these items, non-interest expenses were essentially flat. We continue to drive efficiency in our core expense base to ensure robust and growing investment capacity to fuel our investments in digital, mobile and cyber technology enhance products and services and distribution capabilities. This disciplined expense management allowed us to achieve positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year.Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength in our capital ratios. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 7.88% up 67 basis points from year-ago and common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET-1 ended the quarter at 9.88% or 23 basis points year-over-year. We continue to manage CET-1 to the high-end of our 9% to 10% operating guidelines. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 13.1 million common shares at an average cost of $14.96 per share or total of $196 million. We plan to use the share repurchased to manage our capital following the CECL implementation back to a CET-1 level near 10% by the end of 2020, excluding the benefit of the CECL transition provision provided by the federal reserve, we feel managing internally to a CET-1 level excluding the three year transition, reinforces our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios which we see as a position of strength for the organization. As a result, we are currently planning to repurchase less than a third of the remaining $249 million of share repurchase capacity on our 2019 capital plan in the first-half of 2020.Now, let me turn it over to Rich to cover credit including CECL. Rich? Rich Pohle : Thanks, Zach. Slide 14 provides an update on our CECL adoption. We estimate our allowance for credit losses or ACL will increase 44% from the year-end 2019 ACL to $1.28 billion or 1.70% of total loans and leases on an adjusted basis. As we stated on the third quarter call, given our 50% mix of relatively longer dated consumer loans, the CECL life time loss methodology results in a higher allowance than the prior methodology. The increase in reserves is largely related to the consumer loan portfolio. As we move forward into CECL it is a new accounting standard with many variables. Our day loans for credit losses will be determined using various models and incorporate multiple scenarios historical loss recovery rates, borrower characteristics and other factors. As a result, we expect more volatility in our quarterly provisioning expense. Our parallel testing however indicates that key factors being held constant the aggregate annual level of provision expense is not expected to materially change from the current incurred loss methodology despite that higher quarterly variability.Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter despite challenges in our oil and gas portfolio, our credit metrics remain strong. As we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans, consistent, prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate, moderate to low risk appetite.Net charge-offs remain near the low end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points, net charge-offs represented an annualized 39 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter flat to the prior quarter and up from 27 basis points in the year-ago quarter. The increase was centered on the oil and gas portfolio which made up approximately half of the total commercial net charge-offs. This portfolio was primarily impacted by geological issues compounded by low commodity prices and limited capital activity.We have a relatively small oil and gas portfolio representing less than 2% of total loans and we believe we have appropriately reserved for. Consumer charge-offs have remained fairly consistent over the past year, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package on the slide. Annual net charge-offs excluding the $67 million of oil and gas related losses were 26 basis points and just 15 basis points for the commercial portfolio. The non-performing asset ratio increased two basis points linked quarter and 14 basis points year-over-year to 0.66% again primarily as a result of the stress in our oil and gas book. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans remains relatively stable at 1.04% down one basis point versus the linked quarter.Let me turn it back over to Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Rich. Slide 16 illustrates our expectations for full-year 2020. We expect 2020 to be another year of sustained organic growth as we continue to execute and invest in our core growth strategies. We expect full-year average loan growth in the range of 3% to 4% of continued growth in both consumer and commercial portfolios we expect growth to be modestly stronger on the consumer side focused in home lending and auto finance; we expect slightly more measured commercial loan growth consistent with recent economic data.Full-year average deposit growth is expected to be approximately 3% to 4% as we remain focused on acquiring or checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. Specifically our expectation entails continued decline CDs more than offset by growth in checking and money markets. We expect full-year total revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5% on a GAAP basis which grows in both net interest income and non-interest income. We are projecting the NIM to rebound in the first-half of 2020 from the 2019 fourth quarter before stabilizing in the second-half of the year.Given our relatively neutralized interest rate risk positioning, we remain confident in our outlook for net interest income growth, while deposit pricing remains rationale in our markets we are closely watching the competitive environment around rate and volume of deposits as this represents the primary risk and opportunity for variance to our NIM forecast. We expect non-interest income on a GAAP basis to grow at a slightly higher pace than total revenue in 2020 driven by the continued focus on deepening customer relationships. Full-year non-interest expense is expected to increase 1% to 3%. Based on our active management in 2019, we are comfortable with our current expense base and the run rate trajectory. Our focus is on driving continued investment in opportunities to further differentiate Huntington and drive revenue growth. As we told you previously, and are demonstrating with our actions and our 2020 guidance, we remain committed to targeting annual positive operating leverage. We anticipate that the full-year 2020 net charge-offs will be within a range of 35 to 45 basis points.As Rich just covered fundamentally our credit remains strong, we are taking decisive action to mitigate the risk in our oil and gas portfolio. As a result, we have expectations for oil and gas charge-offs remaining slightly elevated in the first-half of 2020. These charges are fully repressed in our 2020 guidance. We believe we are adequately reserved at year-end and with the life of loan CECL adoption. Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range. Mark Muth : Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up, and then if that person has any additional questions, he or she can add them back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Good morning. Lots to ask about, but I will just maybe start Steve with -- just you talked a little bit about headwinds in commercial, but we do have USMCA and Phase 1 China seemingly done, just curious if you could give us a little bit more color on that and if you're seeing any changes in optimism at all from the commercial customers? Steve Steinour : Jon, USMCA is just recently done, and obviously there are other issues, distractions going on at D.C. right now. So I don't think there is a meaningful change yet, but from what we have reported at the prior conference, and I do expect there is going to be a second-half optimistic - lift. I'm optimistic in that regard, but I think it is going to be a little hesitant, little reluctant in talking with different customers about the start of this year. We did see more cash on balance sheets at the end of the year. So, spot balances were down a bit from where we expected them to be. That was particularly true in auto as customers kept more cash on sheet. So, I think that just reflects the conservatism and just sort of wait-and-see approach. Again, in the Midwest we are hampered by lack of labor, so that is an element in this planning process as well as these uncertainties. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, that's helpful. And then just one more, Zach or Rich, maybe Rich for you, can you talk about the Day 2 CECL impact again, I think what you said is expect the provision to be roughly the same in 2020 compared to 2019, I wonder if I heard that right? And Zach, how you want us to think about provisioning in 2020? Thanks. Rich Pohle : Yes. This is Rich. The testing that we've done -- and again, this is new, so we are kind of going through quarter-by-quarter, the testing that we did, CECL to BAU showed that there were some quarterly volatility with over the course of the year, it tended to level itself out, so we don't see a lot of volatility -- we see more volatility on a quarterly basis going forward, but we don't expect a material change in the overall provision under CECL than we had under the incurred loss methodology. Jon Arfstrom : All right, that's helpful, thank you. Rich Pohle : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. David Long : Good morning, everyone. Rich Pohle : Good morning. David Long : With your revenue outlook for the year, what is the rate backdrop that you're assuming right now? Zach Wasserman : This is Zach. I will take that question, David. Good to talk with you. We are essentially assuming the forward yield curve as it existed in November, although it's relatively consistent with where it looks right now. The Fed funds expectation is relatively neutral. I think the actual forward rate, look at it precisely, included forecasted one rate cuts sort in the late summertime period, but I think as we have noted in the prepared remarks, based on our hedging program, our net interest income, NIM is essentially neutralized from one rate increase and one rate decrease from today. So, I would say taking a step back sort of roughly flat from where we are today. David Long : Got it, and if the rate backdrop goes against you, do you have additional levers that you can pull on the expense side, so you can still produce positive operating leverage? Zach Wasserman : Yes, we do. I think under most realistic rate scenarios, as I mentioned, the hedging program will keep our NIM pretty constant, so we are not expecting how to pull those expense levers, but as always we do have a number of expense levers that we've got at our disposal. I'll take down a few of them. We can always look at the pacing and phasing of our strategic growth initiatives. We've got the number one branch here in Michigan and Ohio, and so, looking at our branch network and the cost around that is an opportunity, and I think generally as we see revenue soften, we typically see just the linked variable expense reduction from compensation tend to mitigate and offset that. So, those are the levers we've got at our disposal we look at all the time. There are other levers like staffing contingency plans, which you saw us pull in the fourth quarter of 2019, which are at our disposal, but again, it's not our expectation that we'll have to do that in 2020. The last thing I'll just say, is you commented positive operating leverage, we are managing and expecting to generate positive operating leverage in 2020. David Long : Got it, I appreciate the color. Thanks. Steve Steinour : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Steve Steinour : Good morning, John. Rahul Patil : This is Rahul Patil on behalf John. Just have a two-part question on your auto lending business, considering that one of the biggest players in auto lending is now becoming more active in the space, are you seeing pressure on pricing or your ability to grow auto loans at the pace that you have previously expected? And then, the second part is tied to CECL. The CECL implementation impact your appetite for auto loans going forward, just trying to gauge, you know, what's your 2020 auto loan growth outlook following a flattish average balance in 2019? Steve Steinour : Yes, John. It's Rich, I will take that. So, I'll take the second question first. So, as it relates to CECL, the auto business is really neutral, and the weighted average life of our typical auto loan is not that much different than what we had under the incurred loss methodology. So, it's a fairly benign impact from a CECL standpoint. As it relates to the overall business strategy, I think, we have just a tremendous franchise across multiple states with thousands of dealers that we've got the ability to drive volume. I think we are in a very high cycle band that tends to be more price sensitive than others. So, I don't see us having any real issues in meeting the origination goals that we've got from the indirect automatic business in 2020. Rahul Patil : Okay. And then, last quarter, I believe you had indicated that the consensus estimate around that time of 3.20 for full-year '20 was reasonable, but I believe that you had assumed earlier a couple of rate cards in that 2020 NIM guidance. Could you just discuss your update? I know you talked about rebound in first half and then stable, but are you still comfortable with that 3.20 level right now? Zach Wasserman : Yes, thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll answer that one. So, the answer is yes, we are still comfortable with the approximately 3.20 guidance that we talked about in December at the Goldman Sachs conference, and just reiterated today in the prepared remarks. We expect the trajectory of that to be kicking higher into the first quarter. So, stabilizing around that level by mid second quarter, and then oscillating around that level through the balance of the year. There is really a couple big drivers of that. So, the most substantial of which is the re-pricing of the deposit maturity that we've talked about in the prepared remarks, there's roughly $5 billion re-pricing in Q1 and other $4 billion re-pricing in Q2. And so far, we're really pleased with both the retention and the pricing on that, which is proceeding according to our plans. The other factor, it's little smaller, but still helpful is the 70 basis points of pick-up we got on the securities repositioning that we discussed earlier. So, those two factors are what driving that and helping us to get the NIM to back to 320.With that being said, there's a couple of factors we're watching. Asset yields on new production, your previous question around auto and residential, we continue to see them where we want them, but that's something we look at very carefully. The other one is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the volume in rate for the deposit costs, again, we're seeing the trend on our expectation, but it's something that we\u2019ll continue to watch. Those are the biggest factors that could cause the NIM to be higher or lower than that 3.20. Rahul Patil : Okay. And then, I just want to clarify one thing, and that is assuming a cut -- rate cut in the summer of this year? Zach Wasserman : Yes, it's assuming that essentially the forward rate curve that exists in November as I mentioned, which if you look precisely at the Fed Funds expectation, and that had one cut over the late summertime period, but even if it's flat, we're going to be roughly [indiscernible]. Rahul Patil : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : One more question on the deposit -- good morning, one more question on the deposit side of things. See what you're expecting for total growth, I'm assuming that's still coming from core customer growth. You mentioned the $5 billion that's going to re-price, underneath that can you just talk about what's happening in your markets as far as just underlying core deposit pricing, and if that's still also coming down aside from what you're just you know, scheduled is going to re-price from the rollovers? Steve Steinour : Yes, I think we're -- as I said, we're seeing the re-pricing activity be pretty much in line with our expectations taking down, but also being somewhat competitive. So we assumed and plan for the right environment we've got right now, and we're seeing a trend in that way. Ken Usdin : Yes\u2026 Mark Muth : Ken this is Mark. I would say that generally what we're seeing on the consumer side is very rational, and as we would have expected, and the re-pricing coming in both with better pricing and better retention has allowed us to then be a little more aggressive on the commercial side, which we do see is more competitive. If you were to point to some of the competitive issues out there, it definitely is on the commercial side, in particular with your large dollar deposit on the commercial side, and we've just allowed some of those to leave the bank as a result of the success we're having on consumer side. Ken Usdin : Got it, okay. And then, one more question just on the mix of the balance sheet, with pretty good loan growth and pretty good deposit growth, what do you see happening in terms of both the size of your securities portfolio, and can you talk about the underlying dynamics of -- in a stable rates environment to your front book/back book? Zach Wasserman : So, the expectation for the securities portfolio -- this is Zach, roughly constant from where we are today. No material change, we like where we're at, and that's the expectations at this point. The second part of the question was -- back book\u2026 Ken Usdin : Rolling off securities and rolling on, how -- if your rates stay low, stay where they are from here what's the dynamic happening in there? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Let's take that offline. I don't have that detail right in front of me. Yes, Ken, I've got that downstairs. So, I'll follow-up with you on that. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thank you, guys. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Steve Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : I'm pleased with our 2019 performance, particularly given the environmental challenges we faced, our active management position, the bank continues to execute on our strategies, and confident about our prospects for 2020. Our top priorities are executing our strategic plan and thoughtfully investing in our businesses for continued prudent organic growth, while delivering annual positive operating leverage. We are clearly building long-term shareholder value through a diligent focus on top quartile financial performance and consistently disciplined risk management. And finally, we always like to end with a reminder to our shareholders, there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, colleagues, and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively a top 10 shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. So, thank you for your interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thanks Cheryl. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides, we'll be reviewing, can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. The call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting at about one hour from the close of the call.Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements.Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and the material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve, where he'll start on Slide 3. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Before we begin, I'd like to express my sympathies to those of you who've lost family members or friends who've been directly impacted by the virus.We\u2019ll open the day with an overview of how we've reacted to the onset of the pandemic, both the challenges it has created as well as the opportunities. The pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption around the world. Extreme market volatility is all through the global economic landscape, the virus has changed the way we live our daily lives. Changed how business is conducted in the short term, probably the long term as well.For Huntington, I believe our purpose and our deeply rooted culture are an extraordinary asset. Our purpose of looking out for people has guided our planning and responses to the pandemic. From the beginning, we\u2019ve recognized the pandemic is first and foremost public health crisis. Therefore, our priority has always been the safety and wellbeing of our colleagues and our customers.Many of our colleagues are on the frontlines with our customers every day and it's challenged us to serve our customers in new ways. To ensure their safety in our branches we moved early to drive through only, but then person meetings by appointment. We\u2019ve closed all in store branches and traditional branches which did not have a drive through.For most other colleagues, we implemented a work from home policy and now have more than 80% of our colleagues working remotely. This is possible because of the commitment and flexibility of our colleagues and because of the tremendous work by our technology teams to keep everyone connected and productive. We've benefited from the diligent work performed by our business continuity planning teams over the years.We've also increased our communication with colleagues, not only keep them informed, but also to keep them engaged and in a position to help our customers. Finally, we added new benefits for our colleagues such as emergency paid time off and other programs for those whose families were directly impacted by the virus. And we took actions to enhance the mental and physical wellbeing of our colleagues.It was clear immediately that our customers would face financial hardships because of the pandemic. We took swift action early and publicly announcing a variety of relief program measures that included loan payment deferrals, fee waivers, and the suspension of foreclosures and repossessions. These measures addressed our customers' critical short term needs but we believe they also demonstrated our purpose in action, showing our customers that we are there for them now and we\u2019ll continue to support them in the future.We believe it's in our best mutual interest to work with our customers during tough times. Relationships are strengthened in these moments. Thousands of college (0:04:22.8) from across the bank globalized to help small business and commercial customers access the SBA paycheck protection program. And over the last three weeks we've redeployed and trained over 700 colleagues to support the heavy volume of SBA applications. I'm pleased to say that we processed almost 26,000 applications in record time, with loan volume of more than $6.1 billion. We were able to process almost every one of these applications into the SBA E-Tran before it closed when funding was exhausted on April 16.We entered 2020 with a relatively healthy economic backdrop across our footprint, and the prospects for the national economy appear to be picking up. However, the pandemic has altered that trajectory for the foreseeable future and we believe the economy will be challenged for some time. We\u2019ve tried to assess what is in store for the economy now. We've informed our thinking with multiple potential economic scenarios.The best case is characterized by a deep V shaped economy with a trough in the second quarter followed by relatively strong recovery later this year. More likely scenario could be described as a long U shaped recovery in which the trough extends later into the year and then the economy does not recover back to pre-COVID activity levels until well into 2022.Over the course of the last two months, the economic outlook has progressively deteriorated. It appears that the reopening of the economy will be more protracted than initially expected. And a U shape recovery is the increasingly likely scenario. So given this highly uncertain environment and rapidly evolving outlook, we do not believe we can provide any meaningful expectations for the full-year at this time.Therefore, we have withdrawn our formal 2020 full-year guidance. Our visibility is generally limited to the next few months. The range of potential outcomes on the key metrics is quite wide. Instead, Zach will provide some near-term expectations later in the presentation.Conservative view on the economic outlook also in forms our thinking on how we manage capital liquidity and credit. Zach and Rich will discuss our current metrics on these items later, but I'd like to discuss generally how we're thinking about risk management.As we've previously discussed over the past decade, we've fundamentally changed Huntington's enterprise risk management. We believe it's now a stress for the company as compared to a clear weakness during the prior cycle.Slide 10, in the presentation details several of the key improvements we've implemented, but they all began with the establishment of our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite in 2009 and the alignment of our credit strategy and policy with that appetite. We also centralized credit underwriting and portfolio management, implemented credit concentration limits and materially repositioned the balance sheet over time.We implemented a deep relationship focus across the bank focusing on the primary bank relationships and exiting loan relationships that did not meet appropriate return on our hurdles.In subsequent years we took actions such as tightening our consumer lending standards to focus on super-prime customers across all our consumer lending products and tightened our underwriting on commercial real estate. We established conservative standards and policies for leverage lending as well. We pointed out over time that the only comparison, of potential loss for this sector, is that Federal Reserve's DFAST stress test.As shown on Slide 11, our modeled cumulative loan losses in the Fed\u2019s severely adverse scenario are consistently among the best in the peer group. As we assess the current environment with respect to the credit impact. We've tried to be conservative and you can see this in the level of provisioning and our allowance for credit losses.We're taking a similar conservative view, conservative approach to capital. Our capital ratios are strong. We intend to maintain high capital ratios as a source of strength to support our customers' needs and to be positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities.With that let me turn it over to Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thanks Steve, and good morning everyone. Slide 4, provides the highlights for the 2020 first quarter. Clearly, results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While our underlying earnings momentum was strong, first quarter results included provision for credit losses of $441 million over 3.5 times net charge offs recognized during the quarter.This was driven by the severely weakened economic outlook compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Rich will go into more detail regarding the drivers of the increase in our provision shortly, but now let's turn to Slide 5 to review our pretax pre-provisioned earnings.Year-over-year pretax pre-provision earnings growth was 2%. We believe this is strong performance in light of the challenges of the interest rate environment and the rapid decline in short-term rates year-to-date.Total revenue increased 1% versus the year ago quarter as growth in fee income more than offset modest pressure on spread revenues, specifically robust mortgage banking income growth of 176% and 50% growth in capital markets fees drove the 42 million or 13% year-over-year growth in non-interest income.FTE net interest income decreased $33 million or 4% year-over-year as 25 basis points of NIM compression overwhelmed 3% growth in average earning assets. On a linked quarter basis the NIM expanded two basis points, as we continue to be pleased with the results of our hedging program and our diligent efforts to reduce our deposit costs.I would like to call your attention to two slides in the appendix that provide important additional information regarding our efforts in these two areas to support the margin.Slide 28 summarizes the hedging actions we've taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and lower interest rate environment. We continuously monitor and prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate.Slide 29 provides an update on the reduction in deposit costs as CDs and money market promotional rates repriced lower and we actively managed commercial deposit costs. The slides illustrates the downward trajectory of our total interest bearing deposit costs by month since July, 2019, including a 21 basis point decline from February to March. We expect this downward trend to continue given the deposit repricing opportunities that remain in 2020.Total expenses were essentially unchanged from the year-ago quarter. This expense discipline reflects the actions we took in the 2019 fourth quarter to reduce our overhead expense run rate, including the reduction of 200 positions and the closure of 30 in-store branches, as well as actions we took during Q1 to quickly react to the current environment, balanced against the impact of continued investment in our technology capabilities.During the quarter, we began the first steps of a multipart expense management plan for 2020, which provided some benefit in the quarter by reducing the most immediately flexible expense lines.I will provide more details on this later. Finally, I would like to note that the normal slides detailing comparisons for our net interest, income and interest margin, fee income and non-interest expense can be found in the appendix.Turning to Slide 6, average earning assets increased to $2.6 billion or 3% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total security's increased 5% from the year ago quarter, reflecting portfolio growth and the mark-to-market on our available for sale securities. We are no longer reinvesting securities cash flows and is that are using this liquidity to fund loan growth.Average loans and leases increased, $900 million or 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the consumer portfolio. Consumer loan growth remained focused on the residential mortgage portfolio reflecting the robust originations of the past four quarters. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 1% from the year-ago, quarter as commercial activity was restrained by economic uncertainty during the first two months of the quarter.However, on a linked quarter basis, you saw end of period CNI loans grow 7% reflecting significant drawdown activity on credit lines. During March, we saw $2.5 billion of commercial credit lines. While we've seen draw activity continue in the first weeks of April with other $700 million drawn through April 15, the pace has started to slow significantly.It is uncertain how long customers will retain these funds as extra liquidity and a backstop against ongoing disruption in the credit markets. We continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average CRE loans reflecting a 2% year-over-year decrease.Turning now to Slide 7, average core deposits increased 1% year-over-year. Note that this growth rate was negatively impacted by the June, 2019 sale of the Wisconsin retail branch network, which included approximately $725 million or almost 1% of core deposits. While linked quarter basis end of period total deposits increased 5% reflecting the aforementioned draws of commercial lines that were subsequently maintained on the balance sheet in various commercial deposit products.Importantly, the amount of commercial deposit inflows over the past several weeks has essentially matched the amount of commercial line draws, allowing us to maintain excess liquidity to meet future customer lending needs. We continue to see a migration in deposit balances from CDs and savings into money market accounts reflecting, shifting customer preferences and a shift in the focus of our promotional pricing.Average money market deposits increased 8% year-over-year, while savings decreased to 7% and core CDs decreased 35%. We expect this dynamic to continue through 2020. Average interest bearing DDA deposits increased 7% year-over-year. While non-interest bearing DDA increased 1%.I showed on Slide 36 in the appendix, we are very pleased that our consumer non-interest bearing deposits increased 5% year-over-year. This growth highlights our continued focus on new customer acquisition and relationship deepening.Slide 8, illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios, the common equity tier one ratio or CET1 ended the quarter at 9.47%, down 37 basis points year-over-year. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 7.52% down five basis points from a year ago.During the first quarter through mid-March, we repurchased 7.1 million common shares at an average cost of $12.38 per share or a total of $88 million. When the COVID-19 pandemic first started to impact the U.S., we paused our buyback for the remainder of the first quarter. We do not currently intend to repurchase any shares for the balance of 2020. This morning, we announced the Board declared the second quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, unchanged from the prior quarter. We expect to sustain the dividend at this level.During periods of macro stress and market volatility, managing liquidity is paramount. Our position of strength and liquidity draws its foundation from our deposit base and the depth of our relationship with our customers. A ratio of loans to deposits stable at 90%. In addition, we have considerable additional sources of liquidity, including our portfolio of liquid securities and borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve discount window.Slide 9 highlights our relative capital strength. Over the past few years, we have maintained our capital position and are now in the top third of regional banking peers on total risk-based capital. Our dividend yield is also in the high end of the peer group.Let me now turn it over to Rich to cover credit, including CECL. Rich? Rich Pohle : Thanks, Zach. Before I provide details on the performance of the first quarter, I wanted to elaborate on the comments Steve touched on at the beginning of the call. Slide 10 details some of these decisions we have made and credit risk management enhancements we have implemented.In 2017, we heightened our underwriting standards for leverage lending. Since we drafted our leverage lending policy in 2015, we have used a conservative senior leverage multiple of 2.5 times to qualify as a leverage loan for our borrowers with less than $500 million of revenues. Also in 2017, we began leveraging the underwriting infrastructure and standards of our auto finance business, the RV and marine portfolio that was expanded through the FirstMerit acquisition. We call that our indirect auto and floorplan dealer \u2013 dealer floorplan portfolios are among the best-performing in defense.We've prepared for the eventual economic downturn, we adjusted our healthcare portfolio by curtailing new construction originations in the long-term care segment. Our healthcare construction portfolio is now down 60% from where it was in 2016.Over the past couple of years, we have continued to refine our credit underwriting, consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We have increased FICO score cuts across our HELOC and Herman Green books and held our commercial businesses to higher standards with respect to credit policy exceptions. So we enter the current credit environment with a portfolio that has been continually fine-tuned over the last several years.Slide 11 illustrates the relative rankings of model cumulative loan losses for Huntington and our peers and the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenarios of the DFAST exercise. As Steve has mentioned over time, this is the only true comparison of credit risk across the sector that we know of, and it provides us independent validation of the credit risk management we have implemented. We like that our portfolio is evenly split between consumer and commercial businesses. It gives us nice diversification in periods of stress, and our DFAST numbers reflect as much. Still the aforementioned steps have strengthened the quality of our loan portfolios.Turning now to the first quarter credit results and metrics. Slide 12 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or ACL, following the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, and the first quarter\u2019s provision. The ACL increased to 2.05% of total loans, up from 1.18% at 2019 year-end. The increase was comprised of the $393 million day one adjustment and a $323 million reserve build in day two provisioning during the first quarter. As you recall, the day one increase was a function of our 50% weighting in the consumer portfolio, which has a much longer weighted-average life and therefore, a larger lifetime loss under CECL.For the quarter, our reserve build consisted of a $258 million increase due primarily to the ongoing economic uncertainty and a $65 million net increase in our specific reserves, almost exclusively against our oil and gas portfolio. The Q1 ACL now includes a 20% reserve against our oil and gas portfolio. For multiple data points we use to size the adjustment we made in Q1, including the Moody's baseline scenario that showed unemployment rising to near 9% and GDP levels falling by 18% in Q2 and different levels of recovery in subsequent quarters. We also weigh the unprecedented level of government stimulus, both to consumers as well as businesses and the potential support to the economy it will provide. These factors drove our Q1 provision.The more recent April economic models now show further deterioration with unemployment reaching 12.5% and GDP falling by 30% in Q2, and an improvement in Q3 that provides less of a net recovery than the March base case showed. We will continue to evaluate data points like these as we size our provision expense for the second quarter.Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the impact that our oil and gas portfolio has had on our overall level of NPAs. We have discussed for several quarters the challenges that we see with this portfolio and have been proactive in recognizing the earnings impact we anticipate as commodity prices continue to range below economical levels for this industry. Oil and gas NPAs represent just under half of our commercial NPAs and one-third of our overall NPAs. They are also a significant contributor to our Q1 NPA increase. Notably, over 90% from a dollar standpoint of these NPAs remain current with respect to principal and interest payments. Outside of our oil and gas portfolio, commercial NPAs were reduced in the first quarter by $65 million.Slide 14 demonstrates that we have a fairly modest exposure to some of the areas that have been hardest hit by COVID-19 to date. We have recently completed deep dive since nearly all these portfolios and are comfortable with our team's assessment of the current situation. Our restaurant exposure is primarily national quick service brands that have maintained drive up operations and our sandwich and pizza chain customers have been opened for takeout service to offset the declines in-house people.Slide 15 details our leveraged lending portfolio. Our conservative definition uses 2.5 times senior leverage for borrowers with under $500 million of revenues to account for heightened risks in leveraging smaller companies. Our leveraged loan book represents under 4% of our total loans and as a percentage of capital, is at its lowest point in several years. We focus on borrowers that are weighted to our manufacturers as opposed to service and other asset-light borrowers. They tend to provide more collateral.Within the manufacturing segment of our leverage lending book, there are no subsegments that account for more than 20%. We've deliberately avoided covenant-light term loan-B structures because to play in that market generally requires providing an understructured parry pursue revolving credit commitment as well. That revolver is typically undrawn at closing but represents potential contingent risk in a down cycle. We hold regular reviews of this portfolio and underwriting follows a consistent corporate process with a designated leverage lending credit executive responsible for its review.Slide 16 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 62 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 39 basis points in the prior quarter and up from 38 basis points in the year ago quarter. The increase was centered on the oil and gas portfolio and one large coal-related commercial credit, which together made up approximately three-fourth of the total commercial net charge-offs. The oil and gas portfolio continues to be impacted by low commodity prices and limited capital markets activity. As I mentioned earlier, we have allocated significant reserves against this portfolio.Annualized net charge-offs, excluding oil and gas and coal-related losses were 30 basis points, demonstrating that the balance of our portfolio performed well in Q1. Our remaining coal exposure is under $200 million, of which 20% carries an investment-grade guarantee.Non-performing asset ratio increased 9 basis points linked quarter and 14 basis points year-over-year to 75 basis points due to the oil and gas impact I described earlier. Consumer charge-offs were down to 35 basis points in Q1 as compared to 41 basis points a year ago, demonstrating our continued strong consumer portfolio. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides.Let me turn it back over to Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thank you, Rich. As Steve mentioned earlier, we have withdrawn our 2020 full year guidance. Historically, we have refrained from providing quarterly guidance as it implies a much shorter time horizon than we manage the company. That said, we want to provide you as much insight into key business trends as we can. So we will focus on where we can frame realistic expectations, therefore, Slide 17 provides comments on the second quarter.Starting with loans, the $3.2 billion of commercial line draws we saw in March and into early April, will drive average commercial loans 4% to 5% higher over the near term, excluding any impact of the $6 billion of SBA PPP loans and any additional SBA PPP loans made in the next phase. We currently expect the majority of commercial line draws to remain outstanding for the next several months. The duration of the PPP loans is uncertain, but we expect a large majority of them to be forgiven and to come off the sheet quickly.We expect consumer loans to be flat to modestly lower. The auto portfolio, and to a lesser extent, the RV/marine portfolio is expected to reduce as vehicle sales activity declines. We expect the pre-existing trend of runoff in home equity to continue, and we expect the residential mortgage portfolio to be flat to modestly higher in the second quarter, as a robust level of refinancing activity acts as a governor on growth.We expect average core deposits to increase 2% to 3% linked quarter. Similar to our expectations for commercial loans, we expect the recent influx of commercial deposits, again excluding the impact of PPP, to remain on the balance sheet through the second quarter. We expect average consumer core deposits to be flat to slightly higher as slowing customer deposit acquisition is offset by similar reductions in attrition given altered branch traffic and consumer behaviors. On the other hand, we expect the bulk of the proceeds of the PPP program will steadily flow out of the bank over the next eight weeks, consistent with the intent of the program. We do not expect deposit growth to fully fund loan growth in the second quarter.Moving to the income statement, provisioning is a key driver of variability in the Q2 earnings outlook, but revenue and non-interest expenses also have a wider than normal range of possible outcomes. We've modeled various realistic scenarios for the revenue and expense outlook, some of which provide the opportunity for us to achieve our annual goal of positive operating leverage and some of which do not.We continue to believe that positive operating leverage is an important part of our long-term value creation model, but we will not allow a short-term view of this one metric to dictate our decisions. We constantly strive to find the right balance between the short- and long-term results. Within these confines, we expect total revenue to decline 4% to 5% linked quarter as the larger average balance sheet is more than offset by moderate pressure on the organic NIM and the COVID-19 related declines in fee income.Customer activity based fee income lines, items, including deposit service charges, card and payment processing are all expected to be pressured. Mortgage banking is expected to remain robust, but historically wide secondary marketing spreads are expected to gradually reduce. All combined, our current expectations for fee income to be down approximately 10% sequentially.We have a little more control and less visibility into the expense outlook for the second quarter. We expect non-interest expenses to increase between 5% and 6% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the CECL increase in compensation-related expense related to the annual ramp of long-term incentives and annual merit increases, partially offset by our expense reduction actions. On a year-over-year basis, expenses would be lower by 2%.We have begun a rigorous expense management plan. We entered 2020, like prior years, having constructed expense management contingency plans and when the challenges facing 2020 became clear, we began implementing these plans.Our approach is focused on four categories of expenses; discretionary expenses such as travel and sponsorships; investments, including marketing, the pacing and prioritization of digital and technology investments and planned business expansions; structural expenses, such as the size and composition of our branch network and corporate facilities infrastructure; and finally, organizational expenses, which include the size of the organization and compensation levels across the company. The actions we will take across these categories vary in terms of how quickly they can be implemented.The quickest expense levers we can pull are within discretionary spending. Our travel and entertainment spending has been reduced dramatically as a result of the lockdown in social distancing measures. We are also curtailing non-essential consulting and outside services expenses. In the investment category, given the macro environment depressing customer acquisition activities, we are prudently reducing near-term marketing expenses. We're also scrutinizing all pre-existing business expansion plans and have delayed some initiatives. However, we are maintaining our digital and mobile technology investments.While less immediate impact, the decisions regarding structural and organizational expenses will provide opportunities to reduce our future expense trajectory. We will not be providing details at this time regarding the ultimate scale or timing of our expense actions, but know that we are taking decisive action.Finally, the most uncertain item in the earnings outlook is credit provisioning. We currently expect net charge-offs in the second quarter to be near the high end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. This is reflective of the ongoing pressure in the oil and gas portfolio as well as broader economic considerations.Fundamentally, our credit remains sound. However, the economic outlook has continued to deteriorate since quarter end and remains highly uncertain. This will result in elevated provisioning and additional reserve building in the second quarter and most likely for the next several quarters. It is too much \u2013 is much too early to estimate the ultimate size of the additional reserve build, but you should expect us to remain conservative in our approach to credit risk management.I will now turn it over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Mark? Mark Muth : Thanks, Zach. Sherry, we will now take questions. We ask, as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. If that person has any additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi. My first question is for Rich. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense on \u2013 of how your allowance was allocated by loan category, please. Rich Pohle : Yes. By loan category, I mean, we've got \u2013 the consumer was about $144 million and commercial was $261 million to get to the 2.05% total allowance. That's the breakdown that we've got for that. Erika Najarian : Got it. Rich Pohle : I think, Erika, you have to \u2013 the challenge that we have with the allowance in this quarter is the models really weren't trained for this, right? And so we had the severe decline in the economic scenario and then the government stimulus that is forthcoming but really hasn't shown up yet at the end of the first quarter. So there's a lot of judgment that went into setting the provision this quarter or various economic models that came out throughout the month of March. We did look at a number of factors when we set the provisions. We believe that we've got the coverage ratio at the end of the quarter where we want them. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question is, I appreciate the detail on reserves relative to DFAST losses. When I look at the fed-run tests and even your company-run tests from 2018, it seems like there's a pretty significant contribution still from commercial real estate. And I'm wondering, as we think about how future charge-offs in this type of recession can play out for Huntington, what are sort of model biases in the stress test model, and I guess, I'm leading the question a little bit by referring to commercial real estate, that might distort how we're thinking about what can actually be incurred in terms of charge-offs.In other words, is \u2013 what part of the stress test is very backward-looking in terms of historical losses in CRE? And what part of the stress tests, obviously, unemployment is one play, seems to be not severe enough? Rich Pohle : So as it relates to \u2013 I think you hit the nail on the head, the DFAST numbers are backwards looking. So the fundamental change that has transpired over this company since the last downturn has been remarkable. And I would say that commercial real estate is probably the one area where we are so fundamentally different today than we were going back. I mean we had close to 5,000 customers on the commercial real estate side going into the last downturn. We have about 300 today. So there's a clear focus on Tier-1 sponsors, Tier-2 sponsors, institutional sponsors.And so we're really focused on knowing the developer in not only the projects that we're financing but the projects that might be financed somewhere else to make sure that we're not overextended there. We also \u2013 from a percentage of capital standpoint, we're over 200% of capital going into the last downturn. We're under 100% of capital today and with very strict limits on various supplements within the commercial real estate space. So I think that's the biggest one.As it relates to some of the other things, clearly, unemployment is going to be a big driver of losses on the consumer side. I think the DFAST results there have been very consistent over time, and our consumer charge-offs in the DFAST scenarios have been at the top of our peer group. So I feel very good about where we stand in a lot of the consumer categories relative to the DFAST results from 2020. Steve Steinour : Erika, I might add. This is Steve. The joblessness or unemployment levels in Ohio and Michigan were double digit when we made the changes to the consumer lending policies, and the models that we have used subsequently have that base in them. So I think 10.3% in Ohio and 14-and-a-fraction percent in Michigan. So that has drove us to a super prime level of origination. We use our prop score, but the equivalent FICOs you've seen quarterly for 10 years, and we will attack the book.So we believe we've got a very sound consumer loan portfolio and the performance expectations around that will be, we believe, supported through this cycle, notwithstanding higher unemployment and somewhat higher losses. And we've been talking for several quarters about oil and gas as an outsized exposure for us in terms of risk of loss, clearly outside of our aggregate moderate-to-low appetite. And we've also shared that we expect to address that substantially early this year, having started to do that last year.So these are all \u2013 these oil and gas credits are all SNCCs. Our losses from what we can tell are coming \u2013 we're taking earlier than \u2013 certainly earlier than required, including the non-accrual decisions. And I think we're frankly going to be slightly ahead or ahead of others in the industry in that regard. Erika Najarian : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Great. I was hoping for maybe a little more detail on the overall modifications and deferrals. Definitely get the number of customers, but maybe if there are some dollars of total modifications in both the consumer and commercial portfolios? Rich Pohle : I'm happy to answer that for you, Scott. It's Rich. Yes, on the consumer side, it's about $2 billion of deferrals that we've processed. We also have made some deferrals for some of the mortgages that we're servicing agent on. But for our book, it's about $2 billion. On the commercial side, it's about $6 billion, but I would say half of that is in our auto floorplan dealerships, and we're counting the curtailments in that number. And most of what we're doing in the auto floorplan space is more curtailment than payment deferral. Clearly, we need the cars to be on the lots a little bit longer than they have been historically, just given the current environment.So if you \u2013 digging into some of the other areas where we've provided deferrals on the commercial real estate and the hospitality space, and retail is one other area on the commercial side. And then in the franchise restaurant space, we've also been active with deferrals. Scott Siefers : Okay. That's perfect. Thank you. And then just on sort of those latter points you made. Maybe if we exclude the floorplan because that makes plenty of sense logically, but in the remaining commercial deferrals, do you have a sense for how much of those deferrals, you would say, are kind of necessary or needed versus how much is customers sort of taking advantage of kind of insurance in this environment? Rich Pohle : I would say that the commercial real estate deferrals are needed for the most part. The hotel occupancy rates, given where they are, I felt like I was the only one in the hotel I was at last night. So I think anecdotally, that's a need. I think the cash crunch in commercial real estate is real.We generally did not have a high bar on proving that you needed it. Part of our looking out for customers is being there when they need us. And so our thought was if you're asking for a deferral, we're generally going to give it to you, but I haven't come back and scientifically determined who really needed it and who didn't. I would just point that commercial real estate is probably the area that needed it most. Scott Siefers : Yes. Steve Steinour : And of the $6 billion floorplan was \u2013 I mean $3 billion of the $6 billion, Scott. So \u2013 and many of the showrooms just frankly aren't open, so understandable there. Scott Siefers : Yes. Steve Steinour : We take a slightly different view on the consumer side, just to share with you. We actually \u2013 the fact that they've asked for deferrals, we take it as a good sign that they intend to stay in the residents or keep the car or other things. With the rapid increase in unemployment, these indications are actually positive from our perspective versus 2008, 2009 when it was hard to communicate with customers. They tended to let houses go. I think the nature of this health crisis will be much more likelihood to protect the house than we would've seen in that prior cycle. Scott Siefers : Yes. Okay. Rich Pohle : The other thing I just point you to is at the time of the deferral, 98% of our consumer and even a higher number of our commercial customers were current. So it wasn't as though this was kind of the delinquent customers reaching out for our help. These are good customers that needed the assistance. Scott Siefers : Yes. Okay. Thank you, guys, very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. John Pancari : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, John. John Pancari : I appreciate the color you just gave regarding the prior \u2013 the stress test and the changes in your business mix over time, and how that can impact your through-cycle losses. I was just wondering if you could maybe, therefore, help us think about what a fair through-cycle loss level would be, given your current mix and given what you're looking at now in terms of your assessment of the economic outlook? I know it's tough, but we want to try to get a better idea of what we're looking at.And then separately, I know on Slide 11, you point to the reserve being 42% of the 2018 to really adverse DFAST, but you also indicated that the April data is pointing to \u2013 or did point to worsening. What do you think the incremental reserve additions could go to here? Where do you think an appropriate relative percentage of DFAST is likely fair here? Thanks. Rich Pohle : Hey, John, I'm going to be challenged to answer both of your questions. And I think as it relates through-the-cycle losses, I think the challenge that we all face is just the uncertainty that we're dealing with right now as to how long this is going to last and what the new behaviors are coming out of this. We feel good about the book going into it. On the consumer side, we \u2013 very good credit quality there. We have pointed out on the commercial side that we're going to have likely elevated charge-offs in oil and gas. Beyond that, it's really hard to come up with a forecast for charge-offs through the cycle here. Steve Steinour : So John, we're hoping to get a better view this quarter if this return-to-work status changes. Right now, next week, Ohio looks like it's going to implement on May 1. Michigan, following that, middle of May. And as these industries start spooling up again, we'll get a better sense of what the recovery might look like. But I think this is going to be dynamic, and best case would be to have a view of this quarter. I think it's more likely going to be third or fourth quarter before we really understand what the growth rates could be to come off what will be this very challenging moment of time and the sustainability of these businesses, and ultimately, how they're going to repay us. Rich Pohle : Yes. So as it relates to what you might see in the second quarter, we're clearly going to probably snap that line at the end of the quarter. We'll take a look at all the new scenarios, we'll look at the impact of the stimulus. Like I mentioned, a lot of that is just kind of reaching the businesses and customers now. There'll be a lot more data that we'll have at the end of the second quarter to decide what the provision expense would be for the quarter. It's going to be just really tough to estimate that right now. John Pancari : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the color. And then you indicated, Zach, in your prepared remarks that you expect to sustain the dividend. Can you just give us your thought process around that? And does that incorporate the updated data that you see coming in now post the quarter? And just your thought process around the sustainability. Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Our intention is to maintain the dividend at the current level. We think that we've got the right capital levels to support that, and we'll continue to monitor it and model, but we think it's the appropriate and sustainable level for now. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Welcome. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steven Alexopoulos : Good morning, everyone. Steve Steinour : Hey, Steve. Steven Alexopoulos : So to start, just to follow-up on Erika's and John's question around DFAST. I think what a lot of us are struggling with is that when we look at CECL, it's supposed to look at lifetime losses. The global economy is basically shut down. And I think we're trying to understand, if you look at that framework and you're coming up with a reserve that's only 40% of DFAST losses, it seems really low. And I think we're trying to get at isn't a large reserve build again coming? Like how do we reconcile the framework of what's going on in the economy and the size of the reserve versus your own internal stress tests? Rich Pohle : Steve it\u2019s Rich. I think think DFAST and CECL are really two different exercises. You can try to link them together, but there are fundamental differences in the assumptions for each. The DFAST scenario, the severely adverse is a deep scenario that continues for an extended period of time, and it also assumes that you're continuing to make loans during that period. There are all sorts of dynamics that go into that. CECL on the other hand is you're looking at something that is reasonable, supportable over a period of time that eventually returns to the mean. And so you're running in a scenario that we'll have a two or three year life and then there's a reversion to the mean on that. And it's also assuming you don't make another loan.So while I think the CECL to DFAST comparison is a good data point. I also don't think you can necessarily draw too much from it, conclusion wise. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, that\u2019s fair. And just for a follow-up, so if we look at Slide 14, the COVID-impacted sectors, I'm surprised you're not calling out some of your auto exposures, I think about floorplan or RV. Are you not expecting to see material decline in revenues for these sectors, right particularly auto. Zach Wasserman : Yes. I mean we've talked about auto. We feel that there is going to be a short-term impact to auto. We don't necessarily think it's going to fall under the same category as hotels and some of the other areas where it could just be a protracted longer impact. I think, ultimately, people are going to get out and buy cars, probably at a reduced level. But we don't see the impact to auto and, to a lesser extent, RV that we do with some of the other ones that we've got in here. Steve Steinour : The floorplan, Steven, are to dealers that have multiple flags. In the 2008, 2009, 2010 cycle, we didn't have a delinquency. The strategy is consistent. These are very strong, typically multi-generation family dealerships that have enormous wealth created over that time and dealers that we believe will be very supportive to the extent they need to. Part of our underwriting also looks at coverage ratio service and parts to fix charge, and most of these are really strong in that regard. Rich Pohle : Just a piggyback on that \u2013 obviously, we did do a deep dive on the auto portfolio, even though it's not listed here. And from a liquidity standpoint, we feel the book is in very good shape. Steve Steinour : We didn't have a charge-off in auto within, don't know, two decades in what we've originated, and we certainly have a lot of conviction going forward in the quality of that book. Steven Alexopoulos : Fair enough, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ken Zerbe : Hey, thanks. I guess just a real quick question, in terms of the energy portfolio, I heard \u2013 if I heard correctly, it was a 20% reserve you have against this portfolio. There's other banks that we heard, like yesterday, has just over a 2% reserve in their energy portfolio. Can you just talk about the characteristics of your energy loans and how it might be different from some of the other banks that you would need such a materially higher reserve on this portfolio? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Ken, well, as we all know, these are all SNCCs. So there's good company in the credits that we're in. So I don't know that it's necessarily so much that our portfolio is any worse off than others. I think as Steve has mentioned, we've been very proactive in recognizing the risks that we see in this book, and we have taken losses in this book over the last five quarters that are pretty significant. And it's reasonable to assume that we're going to have further losses.So when you see the headlines around the big banks starting to form SPEs to take ownership of these credits rather than go through a liquidation process, I think it tells you where the industry is heading in terms of dealing with troubled situations here. So we looked at our book, and we feel that the long-term fundamentals, particularly for natural gas are still not strong. And I think we've sized the reserve around this, taking into account where we see long term prices, not so much on where they are today but longer term.And just the fact that there is a lack of capital markets activity in this space right now is completely different than what transpired in the last downturn. So we think it's appropriate to put higher levels of reserves here, and we'll continue to review it as we go through the spring borrowing base redeterminations and kind of size that reserve going forward. Steve Steinour : And we think this is much more like the early mid-'80s where beginning with Penn Square in 1983, the industry got clobbered and stayed in a tough shape for four or five years. And so we're just trying to be realistic with that view as to what we think the likely outcomes are for this portfolio. And certainly, we've seen subsequent price deterioration as a result of OPEC and Russian issues on the oil side. There's some spillover that's benefited gas in the short term, but these are going to be longer-term workouts. You're going to see a lot of these companies combined. We do think the SPE is the way to go, as we did in the mid-80s.I happen to have direct experience with this in that time frame, and it leads me and, I think, us as a consequence to be clear-eyed about what to expect in the future. And perhaps a bit conservative relative to some others, but we'll see that over time. Ken Zerbe : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just my follow-up question. If I heard right, I think you said you expected elevated provisions for the next several quarters. Can you just talk more \u2013 it's more of a conceptual question. But as I guess \u2013 we would think that CECL should clearly front-end load a lot of the provision expense, but I get there's a lot of uncertainty out there. Can you just talk about that dynamic, which is how much can you really front load for your reserve build versus like when we get to, say, fourth quarter, are you still maintaining a really high reserve even if \u2013 and provision expense even if the economy is not weakening at that point? It seems that provision should be a lot lower by fourth quarter, if I'm not mistaken. Zach Wasserman : The whole concept around CECL is that you are recognizing the losses today on the book that you have today, right? So in a perfect world, if you had perfect foresight into what the economic variables were and they didn't change, you wouldn't have to make any further adjustments. But clearly, we're in a very dynamic market where the economic assumptions that we have to use for the life of a loan are going to materially change over the next several quarters, and that's what's going to drive the additions, or down the road, hopefully, the release of reserves under the CECL methodology. Steve Steinour : I think, Ken, it's \u2013 we're in a downdraft moment. But as we reopen in these different states, we'll start to get a floor and stabilization and the resiliency and recovery. And that could very well happen in the time frames you mentioned based on the fiscal stimulus. We'll be part of that, the banking industry, Huntington will as well. And for the sake of the country, it's great to see the industry in such good shape.So I think we've got a moment here, a quarter or so, a couple of quarters, where things are a bit uncertain, but I think the picture will clarify in the foreseeable future. And that clarity will give us the basis to have more confidence in projections and sharing those with you collectively. And I think it will lead us to a position where having been intentionally conservative will see a better day on the horizon where I hope there'll be some reserve recovery. Ken Zerbe : Alright, great thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks a lot guys. One question on the capital front. So you're right in the middle of that 9.5% CET1, 9% to 10% zone that you enjoy. Do you want to try to stay around that? And also, how does TCE, if at all, come into your thought process around maintaining capital ratios? Zach Wasserman : Yes, this is Zach, I will take this one. So our CET1 for Q1 ended at just about 9.5%. Our goal was to be in the high end of the 9%to 10% range over time. And I would expect continued growth in capital towards the year-end, that's the plan and intention at this point. I think the fact that we mentioned we paused on share repurchases for the time being and for the foreseeable future will be a major driver of that. And we continue to model, as you might imagine, the numerable scenarios around where the year could play out here. But the expectation is sort of continually rising towards the year-end.So it high end of the potential range. So it on CET1, You talked about TCE. TCE ended at just about 7.5%. I think that 7.52%. And likewise, our goal was to be in the somewhat higher than that level. So I expect that ratio to trend higher throughout the year as well. We think about both of the metrics, to be honest. We look at both of them just as much internally as each other. And CET1 is a critical regulatory measure. It's also very comparable across banks. And so it's helpful, I think, for us and for you to understand the relative position. TCE is a key governor, though, as well.And particularly in the last downturn when capital was precious, that measure loomed large. And so we're conscious that both matter, and we factor both into our decisions. I think that said, as I look at the trajectory in both of them, they're pretty similar shapes. And I would expect both to be rising modestly toward the back half of this year. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And just a follow-up on the auto and RV/Marine side. Just in terms of the growth outlook, you generally mentioned it in terms of your outlook on the consumer side. And we noticed that the loan originations in the first quarter $1.6 billion in auto, probably the lowest we've seen in a long time. Do you have a way of helping us understand given the uncertainly, albeit, just what you expect volume growth to traject like in auto and RV/Marine? Zach Wasserman : I mean we really don't have a great view on it kind of longer term in the year. That's why we tried to realistically give you what Q2 will look like. And we do expect a continued modest downdrafts in auto, just given the dynamics we've been talking about before about auto dealerships being largely shuttered and therefore, sales activity being lower. It really will depend on the pace of the recovery and what it looks like to see to what degree we start to see regrowth sequentially quarter-to-quarter in the back half of the year.From a RV/Marine perspective, I think we're expecting less downdraft because that portfolio was always very, very super prime, very focused on the regions where that was a key lifestyle purchase for people, and it's a relatively smaller book, too. So I think probably expect more flattish to down-ish there, but we're also watching that pretty carefully. I think you didn't ask, but on the residential mortgage side, we expect continued robust demand, as you might expect, and essentially pretty flat growth there, just given that demand offsetting portfolio runoff as we redo their mortgages off us. Ken Usdin : Got it. Appreciate it Zach, thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Thank you all. We've talked a lot today about the pandemic. We reviewed the resulting economic challenges. Perhaps most importantly, what we don't know yet. So I'd like to ask you to take a step back, and I'll offer you some perspective. Having been in this industry for four decades, I've seen uncertainty before. And while this pandemic and the elevated concern it brings is very different than any prior periods in my career, we will get through this as a country. The one thing we know from history is Americans are resilient at the core. We as a nation, I believe, have much better days ahead. We're going to learn and adapt, as we have in the past, and build stronger, more nimble organizations as a result. This will be a time of change and innovation resulting in growth, and I believe Huntington is well positioned to move forward. We will emerge stronger and better as a result of the hard work of our colleagues and their concern for our customers. Their commitment can be clearly seen in the way they quickly reoriented to new working arrangements, responded to customer needs and, of course, helped the businesses in our local communities through the SBA PPP program. Their unwavering commitment to our purpose has been inspiring, and I'm proud of what our colleagues stand for and the ways they've looked out for our customers.As I reminded you frequently in the past, our colleagues, along with our Board, are among the largest shareholders of Huntington, collectively among the 10 largest. This is \u2013 the challenges we face today are exactly why we changed our compensation plans in 2010 to make sure we are aligned with long-term shareholders. Preparing for times like this is also why we took actions enumerated on Slide 10, amongst others, to position Huntington to outperform through this cycle.I remain confident about our long-term prospects as we manage through this challenging environment. With that, I want to thank you very much for your interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Mark Muth : Thank you, Michelle. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve for opening remarks. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We're pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect solid execution across the bank despite an incredibly dynamic and challenging operating environment. Revenue was essentially level with the year ago quarter as record mortgage income offset pandemic related headwinds. The actions we've taken to reduce our deposit costs along with the hedging strategy we implemented in 2019 are helping to offset the impact from lower rates. Expenses were down year over year as a result of the proactive expense actions we took in the fourth quarter of '19, as well as the new program we are implementing in 2020. Our business model balance between commercial and consumer provides diversification of revenue where this performance is offsetting challenges. Our increased PPNR year over year reflects consistent execution of our strategies. Our purpose of looking after people has guided our actions during these difficult times. I'm extremely proud of my colleagues and their continued efforts to communicate with and support our customers as well as each other. Over the past month, the bank funded more than 37,000 loans, the total volume of more than $6 billion through the SBA Paycheck Protection Program or PPP, a small and medium sized businesses across our footprint. Huntington is well positioned with robust capital and liquidity to remain supportive of our customers and communities going forward. Huntington received the highest score in the JD Power 2020 mobile app satisfaction study for regional banks, and this is the second year in a row we've been recognized by JD Power, providing evidence that our focused technology investments are being well received by our customers. As we assess the outlook for the economy, we are guardedly optimistic for our gradual economic recovery. The unprecedented levels of government stimulus that supported both individuals and many companies, that support has brought financial stability to market. Recent economic headlines generally appear more positive with homebuilder, auto and RV and marine sales and sentiment exceeding pre-pandemic levels. U.S. consumer retail sales rose 7.5% in June as businesses have resumed operations. In our businesses, we saw record consumer mortgage origination activity in second quarter. Our commercial pipelines have improved over the past two weeks and our customers are becoming more optimistic for the future with many manufacturing customers expected to be back to pre pandemic activity levels during the second half of the year. Our outlook reflects consensus view of economists that the recovery is taking hold, but progress will be uneven. While we do see signs for optimism, we remain vigilant to possible risks and our visibility is generally limited to the next few months. The range of potential outcomes on key metrics remains wide. We are monitoring economic and customer data closely and tightly managing our businesses. As a result of lower interest rate levels, we're taking actions to manage expenses this year, which Zach will further describe. We remain disciplined on expense growth while making further investments in technology and other strategic business initiatives as the economy recovers. And as we discussed previously over the past decade, we have fundamentally changed Huntington\u2019s enterprise risk management, it\u2019s now a strength of the company as compared to a weakness during the prior cycle. Most recent DFAST results demonstrate superior credit performance for our fifth consecutive DFAST filing. Our modeled [accumulative] loan losses in the [fed\u2019s] severely adverse scenario remain among the best in the peer group, while our stress capital buffer established at the minimum level of 2.5% percent. Our commitments to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile is illustrated through the DFAST results. Our second quarter credit metrics remain sound as we address the issues in our oil and gas portfolio. With our second quarter provision, we believe we have the loss exposure in the oil and gas portfolio fully reserved. Our underlying portfolio metrics continue to reflect our expectation for out performance through the cycle. We restrained our commercial lending in 2019 with the fourth quarter average year over year growth rate of 1.8%, which gives us a more seasoned portfolio of commercial loans at this point in the cycle. This morning we announced that the board has cleared third quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common share unchanged from the prior quarter. And based on what we know today, management expects to maintain the quarterly given rate in the fourth quarter subject to the board's normal quarterly approval process and you'll hear more about the dividend from Zach as well. So Zach, I\u2019ll ask you now provide an overview of the financial performance and carry forward. Zach Wasserman : Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Slide 3 provides the highlights from the 2020 second quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.13, return on average assets was 51 basis points, return on average common equity was 5% and return on average tangible common equity was 6.7%. Clearly, results were significantly impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense as we added $218 million to the reserve during the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 4 to review our results in more detail. Year over year, pretax pre-provision earnings growth was 4%. We believe this is solid performance in light of the challenges of the interest rate environment and the rapid decline in short term rates year to date. Total revenue was relatively flat versus the year ago quarter as pressure on spread revenues was nearly offset by growth in fee income. Specifically record mortgage banking income of $96 million was partially offset by waivers to assist our customers, reduce customer activity and the higher levels of consumer deposit account balances that reduced the deposit service charges and cards and payment fees line items. Total expenses were lower by $25 million or 4% from the year ago quarter. This expense discipline reflects the actions we took in the 2019 fourth quarter to reduce our overhead expense run rate, including a reduction of 200 positions and the closure of 31 in store branches, as well as the actions we have taken to adapt to the current environment, balance against the impact of continued investment in our technology capabilities. Finally, I would like to note that the normal size comparisons for our net interest income, fee income and non-interest expense can be found in the appendix. Turning to Slide 5, net interest margin was 2.94% for the quarter, down 20 basis points linked quarter in line with the guidance we provided at the Morgan Stanley conference in June. The second quarter NIM was negatively impacted by a few unusual items that I would like to highlight. Elevated deposits held at the fed during the quarter reduced NIM by 7 basis points versus the first quarter. This impact would have been larger but for our active management to several billion dollars of non-primary bank relationship account balances off the sheet during the quarter. Reduced loan late fees, primarily in our auto portfolio, compressed NIM by three basis points. Additionally, in Q2 NIM was negatively impacted by 3 basis point derivative ineffectiveness mark, while in Q1 the mark was positive 4 basis points. Thus, 7 basis points of the 20 basis points of quarter to quarter NIM compression was driven by this item. Our underlying NIM performed quite well despite the challenging industry environment. Given our strong liquidity position, we continue to actively manage down our cost of funds. Our average cost of interest bearing deposits was 25 basis points in the month of June and we see some continued opportunity for modest further reduction. Our hedging actions continue to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and the lower interest rate environment. In the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion of forward starting asset hedges become active, providing NIM benefit going forward. Moving forward to Slide 6, average earning assets increased $9.9 billion or 10% compared to the year ago quarter. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 15% from the year ago quarter and 14% linked quarter, reflecting the addition of $4.1 billion in average PPP loans. As of quarter end, the total PPP loan balance was just over $6 billion. Outside of PPP lending, we saw solid growth in health care and asset finance in the quarter. Offsetting this growth, auto floor plan line utilization was suppressed due to lack of new inventory from OEMs. And we continue to actively manage the non core exposure in our oil and gas portfolio down, including $170 million of loans sold or under contract to be sold in the secondary quarter. Consumer loan growth remains focused in the residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting robust originations over the past four quarters. Also, as a result of the elevated deposit levels in the quarter, we saw material increase in interest bearing deposits being held at the fed. Turn to Slide seven, we will review the deposit growth. Average core deposits increased 13% year over year and 12% versus the first quarter, primarily driven by commercial loan growth related to the PPP loans and commercial line draws, consumer growth related to government stimulus and reduced account attrition. During the quarter, we saw dramatic shifts in the retail deposit acquisition trends as consumer and business banking customers adapted to the COVID environment. We saw utilization of online account opening channels increase 13% quarter over quarter and 61% year over year. We are now seeing traditional branch based acquisition approaching pre-COVID levels, Slide 8 highlights the trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations and debit card spend, which is consistent with what we disclosed at last month\u2019s Morgan Stanley Conference. Slide 9, illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The common equity tier one ratio or CET1 ended the quarter at 9.84%, down 4 basis points year over year, the tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 7.28%, down 52 basis points from a year ago. Let me turn it over now to Rich to cover credit. Rich? Rich Pohle : Thanks, Zach. Before I get into the second quarter credit results, I want to turn your attention to Slide 10, which illustrates the relative rankings of modeled cumulative loan losses for Huntington and our peers in the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenarios of the 2020 DFAST exercise. As Steve has mentioned over time, this is the only true comparison of credit risk across the sector that we know of, and it provides us independent validation of credit risk management discipline and practices we've been implementing for over a decade now to achieve an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Our 2020 DFAST result puts us at the top of our peer group and we've been a top quartile pure performer in each DFAST exercise since 2015. Our portfolio composition evenly split between consumer and commercial businesses gives us diversification in periods of economic stress, and our DFAST numbers reflect as much. Turning now to the credit metrics and results. Slide 11 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or ACL from year end 2019 to the second quarter. You can see our ACL is more than double during this period, increasing by just under $1 billion dollars to 2.27% of loans. Excluding the PPP loan balances, our ACL would be 2.45% as of June 30th. The second quarter allowance represents a $218 million reserve build from the first quarter. Like the first quarter, there were multiple data points used besides the provision expense for Q2. The primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the main Moody's baseline forecast. This scenario assumes peak unemployment in Q2 2020 of 15%, followed by rebound to 9% by the end of 2020 and a slow recovery to 8.5% by the fourth quarter of 2021. GDP recovers from 33% decline in 2Q 2020 to end the full year down almost 6% and demonstrates 1.5% growth in 2021 with most occurring in the second half of the year. The Q2 ACL now includes a 30% reserve against our and oil and gas portfolio, and we believe we have the last content in this portfolio fully reserved. We have bifurcated this portfolio into core and non core segments with the non core portion representing just under 60% of the oil and gas borrowings. Our 30% coverage includes a 44% coverage ratio against the non core portfolio and 9% reserve against the core portfolio. Recall it our oil and gas portfolio represents about 1% of total loans. Slide 12 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the impact that our oil and gas portfolio has had on our overall level of NPAs. We have discussed for several quarters the challenges we see with this portfolio. Commodity prices continue to range below economical levels for this industry. Oil and gas NPAs represent 40% of our overall NPAs and are also a significant contributor to our Q2 NPA build. Notably, over 95% of our oil and gas NPAs were current pay with respect to principal and interest as of quarter end. Slide 13 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we've provided to our commercial customers. The commercial referrals are now graduating to amendments and waivers. And outside of the hospitality and other travel related businesses, we do not see a widespread need for additional payment relief. Our auto dealers and franchise restaurant customers, two of our larger referral users are both exiting those deferral periods in strong shape, and we expect nearly all those deferrals to run their course in Q3. To date requests for additional deferral periods have been limited in the other commercial portfolios as well. Slide 14 shows our consumer deferrals and the early news here is good as well. Our auto RV Marine and HELOC portfolios are performing as we would have expected with modest post deferral delinquencies. Our focus on high FICO customers here have shielded us somewhat from job losses we\u2019ve seen. The mortgage accommodations are a two step process as the new forbearance agreement is necessary upon the expiration of the first. As a result, we have limited visibility to the resolution here. Slide 15 provides an update to the industries hardest hit by COVID-19 to date. We have thoroughly reviewed these portfolios, as well as 75% of our total commercial loan portfolio since April and believe we'd have the existing risks identified and appropriately managed. Our hotel exposure centered on five primary sponsors most of them are long-term relationships, including through the last downturn. We believe these sponsors have the liquidity and financial flexibility to see their way through the longer term recovery period we forecast for this industry. Our restaurant exposure is primarily in the national quick service brands that have maintained drive up operations and our sandwich and pizza customers have been open for takeout service to offset the decline in in-house seating. We believe this book to be in good shape overall but we'll continue to closely monitor the heightened risk in a single location and other non franchise names in the portfolio. As a leading SBA lender in the country, we also have guarantees on over $400 million of the restaurant, childcare, physician practices and other sectors, which provides us additional opportunities for recoveries. In the second quarter as part of our exit portfolio management process, we evaluated the COVID related impacts across all portfolios and took appropriate actions as required by regulatory guidance to downgrade those severely impacted credits to criticized status. This review resulted in an increase to our criticized asset level of $1.1 billion in the quarter. As you would expect, they were setted on the industries referenced in the chart, hospitality, retail, airport parking and our auto suppliers. The customers in these affected industries except for auto would have longer path back to a full recovery and we felt it prudent to move those credits to criticized status. We will take a patient approach to working with these customers. We currently do not see a significant loss content. On the 30% of the downgrades we did not attributed to COVID, most of that was in our oil and gas portfolio. Slide 16 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance on the whole was strong. Net charge offs represented an annualized 54 basis points of average loans and leases. The commercial charge offs were centered in the oil and gas portfolio, which made up approximately 75% of the total commercial net charge offs. I would also point out that nearly all these oil and gas charge offs resulted in loan sales closed or contracted for sale during the quarter, as we prudently reduced our exposure to this industry. Annualized total net charge offs excluding the oil and gas related losses were 24 basis points, demonstrating that the balance of our portfolio continue to perform well in Q2. Consumer charge offs were down to 30 basis points in Q2, demonstrating our continued strong consumer portfolio. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. The non performing asset ratio increased 14 basis points linked quarter and 28 basis points year over year to 89 basis points due to the oil and gas impact I described earlier. Let me turn it back over Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thank you, Rich. Turning to Slide 17, I'll provide our expectations for the third quarter. As was the case last quarter, we feel it's prudent to limit our guidance to the current quarter due to the ongoing uncertainty around the economic outlook. As Steve alluded to earlier we have confidence that our businesses and are pleased with our second quarter results given the headwinds in the quarter. Our sentiment has improved from 90-days ago due to the recent trends we're seeing and the actions we've taken to better position the bank for success going forward. Looking at the average balance sheet for the third quarter, we expect average loans to be approximately flat on a linked quarter basis. Consumer loans are expected to increase approximately 2%, driven by continued growth in the residential mortgage and RV and marine lending. Commercial loans are expected to decrease approximately 1% as the full quarter impact of PPP is more than offset by continued reductions in dealer floor plan and commercial loan utilization rates. Our current projections assume the majority of the PPP balances will remain on the balance sheet through the end of the year. Our early stage commercial pipelines have been building over the past several weeks, supporting the expectation of accelerating growth in the latter part of the year. We balance this customer optimism within acknowledgement of the fluidity of the current economy and some concern that the recent upward trend in the infection could dampen the pace of the economic recovery. We expect average total deposits to decrease approximately 1% linked quarter. Commercial deposits are expected to decrease approximately 3%, assuming gradual usage of deposit inflows from the government stimulus. We expect total revenue to increase approximately 2% linked quarter with the net interest income increasing 2% to 4%. We expect GAAP NIM to expand approximately 7 basis points to 10 basis points versus the second quarter NIM of 2.94% as a result of the hedging strategy and the elimination of notable items, which negatively impacted the second quarter, namely 3 basis points of reduced loan rate fees and 3 basis points of derivative ineffectiveness mark. Our NIM expectation does not include material benefit from the acceleration of PPP fees from the repayment of forgiveness of those loans in the third quarter. We expect fee income to be approximately flat as mortgage banking activity remains robust and pandemic impacted revenue lines rebound. Based on the debit card trends, we would expect a slight pickup in card related fees in the third quarter. Deposit account activity volumes are increasing. Yes, given the elevated level of consumer deposits we do not expect a full recovery in deposit service charges. These increases are expected to be offset by reduced other income as the second quarter contain gains of $18 million related to the annuitization of a retiree health plan and the retirement plan services record keeping business sale. As I mentioned earlier, we are benefiting from the expense actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, given both the significant economic challenges of 2020 and the desire to sell fund some of the compelling initiatives being identified in our ongoing strategic planning process, we are now executing the expense management program we have previewed for you on prior calls. As I mentioned previously, our outlook to this plan is focused on four categories of expenses, the size and compensation level of the organization, structural expenses, including our branch and corporate facilities, investments primarily the optimization of level of marketing and lastly, other discretionary expenses. This program is sized to generate approximately $75 million of annual savings in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, this cost rationalization will allow the bank to prudently manage expenses, given the economic and business uncertainty that exists this year. We've modeled numerous scenarios for the 2020 financial outlook, the majority of these forecasts achieving positive operating leverage for 2020, inclusive of the expected approximately $25 million of restructuring costs related to the expense management program. Importantly, we've been positioning the company for some time to be ready to capitalize on opportunities to drive accelerated revenue and market share growth that will arise when the economic recovery begins to solidify. While our longer term planning for 2021 is still a work in process, our current expectation is that we continue to see positive signs of economic stabilization and regrowth, we will accelerate investments in digital technology capabilities, product differentiation and other strategic initiatives in the latter part of 2020 and into next year, potentially utilizing up to the full amount of these savings for this purpose in calendar year 2020. Thus this program provides the opportunity to fund these initiatives, while generally maintaining a strong expense efficiency level in 2020. Focusing on the expense outlook for the third quarter, we expect non-interest expenses to increase approximately 5% on a linked quarter basis. Approximately 2% of this growth is driven by the $15 million of the total approximately $25 million restructuring costs associated with the expense management actions that we recognized in the third quarter. The remaining approximately 3% is driven by investments in technology and marketing, as well as the return of customer and sales activity closer to pre pandemic levels. Finally, we expect net charge offs in the third quarter to be near 65 basis points. This is reflective of the potential charge offs in the oil and gas portfolio, as well as broader economic considerations. Fundamentally, our credit remains sound. However, the economic outlook remains uncertain and we're likely to see elevated provisions expense through the remainder of 2020. Michelle, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person have any additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : There's a lot of places to go, but let's just talk oil and gas to get that out of the way. Longer term, what's the plan there? Is it just to get down to $500 million or $600 million? What you call your core portfolio? And if you could maybe project, is it are you done in Q3 or you're done in Q4? When does the noise start to go away from this portfolio? Rich Pohle : With respect to the oil and gas piece of it, we\u2019ve kind of bifurcated into a core and non core sector, and the focus is really on getting that non core piece of the portfolio down and through whatever methods we have. You saw in Q2 that we sold about $170 million to the extent that we've got opportunities where we think the sale price is better than what a recovery might be. If the credit got into trouble, we would certainly do that. As it relates to the ongoing strategy, we're not originating any new loans in that space we haven't for over a year now. And I think, we're really just focused on the portfolio we have now and managing the risks there. Steve Steinour : Jon, this is probably the last quarter we're going to distinguish ourselves with reporting out the oil and gas like this, because we believe we've got box now fully reserved. And while you will see metrics around that, we don't feel a need to call it out like we have this quarter and is picking up in the normal course and we\u2019ll look to maximize, particularly the non core overtime. Jon Arfstrom : And then just a follow up, the rest of it looks so clean from a credit perspective. And Zach you talked about the third quarter, fourth quarter provisions remaining elevated. I see it 2.45% ACL and relatively tame credit metrics. I guess the question is, how much of reserve build do you think you still need and how do you want us to think through that third quarter, fourth quarter provision level? Rich Pohle : We haven't really thought about what a build in the third quarter would look like. As you work through the seasonal methodology, it is a point in time process. And so, similar to what we did in Q2, we will do the same process in Q3. We will look at what the change in the economic outlook might be for the end of September. We're certainly not going to race into anything earlier in the quarter. We're going to take every available day we have to look at the economic condition and the forecast that we see. We'll also have another quarter of portfolio activity to see how the portfolio is behaving relative to our expectations. And based on those two factors, we'll look at where we think the provision ought to be. So it's really hard for us to sit here and really CECL wouldn't hand you forecast additional build, it's really a quarter by quarter kind of step by step process. Steve Steinour : But Jon, we do like generally how the portfolio has performance thus far and feel good. Having looked at a very substantial amount of the commercial portfolio in depth during the quarter and tried to have a realistic if not conservative lens on it, which is reflected in some of the metrics like the criticized loan increase. But the performance for the quarter was slightly better than we would have expected it to be at the core. But we've got a recurrence of the viruses it looks like coming and we don\u2019t know when the fourth round is going to happen. There's a lot of unknowns here. So it's very, very difficult to project where this is not felt yet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : On your comment right there you just mentioned to Jon about looking at the reserves each quarter, you just mentioned you look at the behavior of your credits versus your expectations. Isn't that a dynamic that under CECL should have already been factored into the reserve in terms of how the credits are actually behaving versus what you modeled, because now you're providing a lifetime loss expectation? Steve Steinour : That's right, my comment was meant to mean that we will look at how the portfolio, if there are changes in the portfolio from the end of Q2 to the end of Q3. John Pancari : So what about the growth then versus the underlying credit? Steve Steinour : It could be growth, it could also be changes in underlying credit. I mean, to the extent that there is further deterioration or improvement either way in the portfolio that gets reflected in the modeled outputs for what would go into Q3. John Pancari : And then I guess, so if the 2.45% reserve right now, excluding PPP loans does represent your best expectation of the lifetime loss content of your loan portfolio. How do you attribute the difference between that ratio and your company run most recent DFAST estimate that you did? Does it all come down to the macro assumptions and the amount of stimulus that you're factoring in? Steve Steinour : We haven't disclosed the company run DFAST scenarios. But certainly, there's going to be a number of factors that will go into, you know, what we provided in our forecast versus what we're just running through the models. John Pancari : And then lastly just want to ask about the cadence of the cost saves of the $75 million. Could you talk about how, I know you mentioned a portion in 2020 and then the rest in 2021? Could you just talk about how we can expect the timing of that to play out? Zach Wasserman : So as I mentioned, it's about a $75 million save in both years. And over time, like we've said many times in the past, we want to manage the expense base based on the revenue outlook. And so, a very substantial chunk of that $75 million we would expect to flow to bottom line in 2020 and not be reinvested to the extent that we see the economy improving as we go forward and the pace and level of that recovery becomes more certain we would expect to start to rev up the investments, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and therefore, have a less or potentially even neutral net benefit from that in \u201821, as we go forward. But for 2020 just to kind of come back to your question specifically around third of that save accrued to the second quarter and it was around $50 million left on a gross basis before any modest acceleration investment in back half of the year and before the $25 million restructuring costs in Q3 and Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : I was just wondering if you could help us walk through the impact of PPP in terms of the yield you're seeing on that portfolio, what it added to NII? And Zach, I know you said that forgiveness is not built into the forecast. But how are you generally anticipating it to go going forward? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Let me try to put some math behind this for you. Just starting first with the yield, it was accretive to yield in the second quarter by as we noted, about 2 basis points of net interest margin. Really what drives that is the portfolio rate that we were seeing in June was 3.43% on an accrual basis for those loans in June, which was made up of 1% of the underlying yield. And then the amortization of what for us based on the size mix of our loan of PPP, our PPP loans was around 3% placement fee over the life of the loan. So, the combination of those two things for June was 3.43% and hence additive to the overall NIM by around 2 basis points. It was about $35 million in revenue in Q2 as well. As we go forward into Q3, from a NIM perspective, I think it's accretive by around 1 basis points is our current estimate. So, it's a tiny drag on a quarter to quarter basis of 1 basis point down, but pretty neutral in that respect into the third quarter. In terms of the forgiveness, I think it was the other part of your question. This continues to be a function of estimates as you might imagine. But our planning estimate at this point is that roughly 85% of the loans outstanding will be forgiven. The process around that is the thing that's driving the most uncertainty around the timing. And so right now, we're assuming that the loans less than $150,000 each, which is around $1 billion of the $6 million loans, will be on a, likely on the fast track forgiveness process and hence will likely be forgiven in the fourth quarter. Thus, our planning assumption for that. And then, let\u2019s say around 10% of the remaining greater than $150,000 loans are forgiven in Q4. So, which would make about one quarter of the total $6 billion forgiven in Q4 with the remainder of 75% forgiven, of what\u2019s going to be forgiven in Q1. So, I think by the end of the year, we expect on an average basis in Q4, we still expect to see around $4.7 billion of PPP in the fourth quarter coming down to around $700 million by Q1 of next year. Ken Usdin : And just a follow up the $35 million you recognized in Q2 when you get a full quarter of it in 3Q. What are you ballparking that to turn into? I know you put it in NIM terms directionally, but in terms of dollar terms? Zach Wasserman : $50 million roughly Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Janet Lee : This is Janet Lee on for Steve. I have a follow-up question on energy. So your energy levels are at 30% of total exposure and this being fully reserved for the loss content. Can you just share with us some of the key underlying assumptions baked into this reserve level, such as a trajectory of energy charge offs, NPLs and criticized going from here, as well as some of the macro factors like where you think the oil price is trying to head up? Thanks. Rich Pohle : We took a number of factors as we kind of size the reserve build there. When we looked at the core and non core portfolios, there were a number of factors that went into that designation, whether its liquidity and, but a big piece of that is borrowing base coverage and that lasts as long as the hedges lasts. And so, our challenge with the book in general is just our view on where commodity prices are going to go and as the hedges roll off, there's just more exposure to what we think is a pretty uneconomical level of price to support drilling and more important to support capital. So, the seasonality of the oil and gas business will drive some of the charge off decisions as you would expect the spring and fall borrowing base redeterminations are a big driver of kind of a fresh look at where the loans are relative to the collateral. And that's part of what we saw in the second quarter was the spring redetermination results kind of flowing through. And then we felt we were very proactive in terms of getting out of credits. There were four structural over advances in deals in our book. In the second quarter, we sold two of them and the other two to NPA. So, you know, I think as it relates to further NPA growth that will be really based more around borrowing base redetermination areas. The charge offs will be a function largely of our sale opportunities and also around borrowing base determinations. Janet Lee : And I think last quarter, you disclosed $3 billion exposure and leverage funding comprised of a number of different industries. Some of your peers experienced some charge offs in the leverage funding portfolio. I just want to see like how this portfolio is performing anything at normal you're seeing on the credit front. Thanks. Rich Pohle : As it relates to the leverage lending, the portfolio did grew up modestly in the second quarter, went up 5% to 6% really due to falling angel activity more than anything as it relates to new originations. So as you might recall, we've got a fairly modest leverage threshold for leverage loans. It's 2.5 times senior as opposed to most people did 3 times. So, to the extent that these credits with us first quarter it was all kind of fell into that criteria we designated on falling angels in the leverage lending bucket. We did not have any leverage lending originated charge offs in Q2. We are keeping an eye on them from a prep class standpoint. There were some downgrades within that book as you might expect but nothing significant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens Inc. Please give us your question. Terry McEvoy : I just was wondering if you could discuss the health of the auto dealer portfolio, I know is an area of focus last quarter. You mentioned earlier on the call that inventory levels are lower and there was an incremental reserve build here in the second quarter? Steve Steinour : Yes, is it the auto floorplan business is actually bouncing back in very good shape. We have about a half of billion dollars of deferrals, deferred P&I in that book and that is all going to roll off in the third quarter. There's very, the demand notwithstanding the fact that new car inventories are down, June results were very strong across our dealer book. So, we expect that book barring any further shutdowns or things like that to bounce back pretty quickly. The challenge for that sector is just getting inventory, and they don't think that they'll be back to full inventory levels on their lots before the end of the year. So, there was not much in the way at all of reserve build as it relates to the floorplan. And the indirect, do you want to tell them about it? Zach Wasserman : The indirect is performing very well. You can see the deferral piece of that was fairly modest to start with about 8%. I'm sorry about 3% of the book. And coming out of the deferral, the payment rates are very strong. We've got 92% paying as agreed coming out of the deferral. So, we are watching that like we're watching all the consumer portfolios just given the impact of the deferrals on the overall book. But that's a high FICO book. We have a custom scorecard and that book has performed very well through the DFASt exercises and we expect it to continue to perform well. Terry McEvoy : And then just as a follow-up, thanks for Page 8, the bottom right, the volume, thanks for updating that exhibit. Just the decline in the last couple weeks or maybe the last month and volume and transactions. Is that just the short term blip, or are you seeing just the increase in number of COVID cases beginning to impact volume overall? Zach Wasserman : Are you talking about the debit card volume, Terry? Terry McEvoy : Correct, bottom Right. Zach Wasserman : So, we've seen it's like a roughly 2% year over year reduction in the last week versus the prior 10 days. So I think in the first 10 days of July, debit volumes were up about 20% year on year. In the last week, they were up 18.7%. So not even 2%. I guess as I talked about the numbers. And I think as we look across industries, we are seeing a little bit of a blip down. I was studying the numbers this morning and one of the industries where we're seeing the most substantial blips, not surprisingly, is in restaurants and bars. So, likely that is to some degree impacted by what we're seeing in terms of some of the economic reopening guidance changing and things of that nature, but we're still seeing pretty robust snapping back in year over year growth overall. Operator : Thank you [Operator instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brock Vandervliet : Thanks, most of the high points have been covered. I was wondering if you could just talk about mortgage and what your expectations are for the remainder of the year. It's seems a bit like COVID is kind of pushed out the spring selling season. Obviously, we've got a massive change in rates. Can you sustain your performance year longer than you would in a normal year I guess? Steve Steinour : What we're seeing in the market here is that it's a lack of inventory. We've had very good, very strong sales. So construction is not keeping pace with demand and you\u2019re seeing that flow through in terms of a number of levels of inventory in a number of markets, I should say. So, we've had a very strong performance on the housing front and we think that will continue as a consequence of the virus. And it's somewhat labor constrained on the build or supply side. Brock Vandervliet : And the primary, secondary mortgage spreads have been kind of juiced up with all the damage in the fixed income markets. Do you see that rapidly coming in here in the third quarter, or is that more sustainable, which would support mortgage banking reps? Zach Wasserman : I will just tack on some of Steve's comments and try to address that specific question. Generally, I think the outlook for Q3 is pretty similar to Q2 in terms of volumes and the modest tightening of spread. It was sort of around 15 basis points, 10 basis points to 15 basis points lower spread as that trend continues for a while. I think the outlook Q4 is harder to ascertain at this point just based on the timing of pipeline and things of that nature. Really the pipeline for Q2 or for Q3 looks pretty similar to what it did for Q2. With that being said, our planning assumption is that the spreads will continue to come down in Q4 and the volumes are typically seasonally a fair amount lower in Q4, and we'll also see that down drop as well. So, I think that the trends you noted are in fact happening, you know the velocity with which they happen is still a question mark. Brock Vandervliet : And on the deposit fees due to some of those waivers, fees were kind of lighter. How quickly can that come back? Zach Wasserman : We're assuming that some of them come back in the third quarter. I think really it's going to be a function of how quickly the deposits on the sheet start to get used. I think, this is a phenomenon that we've noted across the entire industry that the deposit gathering activity in second quarter was just extremely robust. And you know, what we've seen in our own portfolio is around 70% of the estimate on the consumer side of the government stimulus and to some degree some of the other employee benefits are being saved in accounts, and that's only taking down single digit percentage points per month as we go forward. So, it's hard to say because that's going to be the key driver is what happens with overall deposits and therefore, sort of overdraft activity. With that being said, we are expecting a modest increase as we go into the third quarter and then I sort of indicated in our comments Q4 is harder to ascertain. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for any closing remarks. Steve Steinour : So, thank you all for your questions and interest in Huntington. Obviously, we're pleased with second quarter performance, particularly given the challenges we face. And while guardedly optimistic today, we acknowledge volatility and the uncertainty in the economy. With the expense actions we announced today, we are positioned to invest in growth initiatives and opportunities, while continuing to deliver solid performance. Our disciplined enterprise risk management provides us strong fundamentals position. And during these past several months, we\u2019ve positioned the bank to continue to execute on our strategies to further invest in our businesses and technology and to capitalize on opportunities that present themselves. I\u2019m confident about our ability to manage the challenges we face, and I'm excited about our prospects going forward. Finally, we always like to end with a reminder to our shareholders that there's a high level of alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively among the 10 largest shareholders for Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long term performance. Thank you again. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mark Muth : Thank you, Melissa. Welcome, I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one-hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, our Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle Chief Credit Officer. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington strategy to build the leading People-First, Digitally-Powered bank in the nation, which the Board affirmed this year and our multi-year strategic planning process. Huntington's strategies are delivering long-term revenue growth. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we are driving revenue growth despite headwinds of the current environment. We're focused on acquiring new customers and deepening those relationships to gain both market share and share of wallet. We are investing in customer-centric products, services and infrastructure that will drive sustainable growth and our performance both today and for the years to come. Huntington has built a competitive advantage with our consistently superior customer service and our differentiated products and services. We are committed to developing best-in-class digital capabilities like our mobile banking app, which has been audited by J.D. Power, two years in a row, and our online banking, which was number two in this year's J.D. Power study. In the past few weeks, we introduced several new innovative products and features that will continue to serve our customers' needs and differentiating Huntington from our competition. First, we extended 24 Hour-Grace to businesses, we then introduced our no-fee overdraft $50 Safety Zone for both consumers and businesses, and finally, earlier this week, we announced our latest innovation Huntington Lift Local Business, the $25 million micro lending program that capitalizes on our best-in-the-nation SBA lending expertise to better serve minority women and better-known businesses. We've intentionally diversified business models, balanced between commercial and consumer, which provides diversification of revenue and credit risk. We have a proven track record of solid execution adjusting our operating plans to the environment in order to drive shareholder returns. This has allowed us to deliver seven consecutive years of positive operating leverage and I expect 2020 will be our eighth. This focused execution has and will was to ensure investment in the products, people, and digital capabilities that will drive sustainable long-term growth and our performance. Turning to Slide 4 for an update on our digital and branch strategies, following the completion of the FirstMerit acquisition in 2016, we began the evolution of our consumer go-to-market strategy from being branch centric to a powerful multi-channel model that includes leading digital channels. We introduced the Hub, which forms the backbone of our award-winning mobile app and our online banking platform. That evolution has accelerated this year with increased customer adoption of mobile and digital products and services, and we are successfully driving digital sales and originations, as well as changing and expanding the branch experience to include virtual and digitally assisted delivery. Our branch sales activity is almost back to pre-COVID levels, it is about 95% today, but we're seeing an accelerating evolution of the way our customers use branches. Simpler transactions are rapidly moving into faster and easier mobile and digital venues. This transition is allowing our branch bankers to focus on providing more valuable advice and focusing on deepening our customer relationships, all ways of looking out for our customers. As we've discussed previously and as shown on the bottom of the slide, Huntington regularly evaluates and optimizes our branch distribution, since the completion of the FirstMerit acquisition in 2016, we have reduced our branch count by 263 branches or 24%. This includes the consolidation of 99 branches or 9% as part of the integration, the sale of 32 branches in Wisconsin and the consolidation of an additional 132 branches or 4% annually on average since 2016. Last month, we announced the planned consolidation of 27 additional branches or 3% in the 2021 first quarter. We're pleased with the high retention levels post consolidation of deposits due to the strong foundational relationships with our customers and the close proximity to other Huntington branches as we have maintained our branch share position in almost all markets. This thoughtful branch network optimization strategy allows us to continue to capitalize on our competitive advantages around convenience, our brand promise and customer service. If you did not listen to Andy Harmening's presentation on our digital transformation at an Investor Conference in early September, I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website and listen to the replay and see the presentation materials. I believe our digital strategy and our execution of that strategy is generating industry-leading results. We delivered very strong third quarter results including a record level of pre-tax pre-provision earnings, thanks to continued solid execution across the bank in the face of a continued challenging operating environment. I am particularly pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth as earning asset growth more than offset NIM compression to drive spread revenue modestly higher, while fee income growth was bolstered by the second consecutive quarter of record mortgage banking income. The performance of our home lending team was outstanding. They originated more than $3.8 billion in mortgages for the second consecutive quarter. To frame that for you, our previous high watermark for any quarter was $2.5 billion of mortgage originations in the fourth quarter of last year. Our combined mortgage production over the past two quarters was greater than we did in all of 2018 and roughly the same as in all of 2019. So these accomplishments were the direct result of the successful build-out of this team and our investments in our digital mortgage lending platform over the past several years. We're well positioned to capitalize on the current mortgage environment and the near-term outlook remains strong. Given the prolonged low interest rate outlook, we have implemented a comprehensive action plan to stabilize NIM near current levels over the long term. Zach will cover this and more in his remarks. We continue to closely manage our expenses. A significant portion of the year-over-year increase in expenses resulted from restructuring costs related to implementation of expense management program we announced last quarter and elevated variable costs to support our record home lending business volumes. As we previously discussed, our efforts have been to manage expenses so that we can allocate investments to our strategic growth initiatives. Looking forward, we remain optimistic of the continuing economic recovery, the unprecedented level of government stimulus has supported both individuals and many companies, we're very pleased with the number of customers exiting forbearance arrangements. Our consumer lending businesses, which as you've seen in our quarterly originations dated provided for a decade are focused on super-prime customers and they're performing very well. Mortgage, auto, and RV marine are all continuing to post strong originations. Commercial lending has been restrained by the economic uncertainty, many customer shepherding elevated levels of liquidity, paying down revolvers and putting off new investment spending. We have continued to see improvements in commercial pipelines that we mentioned last quarter and based on the conversations we've had with our customers; we expect these levels of elevated liquidity to persist for some time. We're cautiously optimistic that C&I loan growth will improve later this year and early next year. The timing of forgiveness around the PPP loans remains uncertain. But I would like to take a moment to share that Huntington was the nation's largest SBA 7(a) lender for the third consecutive year in the SBA's fiscal year ended September 30. We are the largest 7(a) lender in our footprint with a 12 year in a row. Small businesses are such a vital component of our economy in the nascent economic recovery as they consistently account for the lion's share of jobs created in our country, particularly this pandemic these businesses deserve and need our support and I hope these businesses are the focus of any future government stimulus package. Our third quarter credit metrics reflect stable to improving trends across most portfolios and include elevated charge loss from the sale of more oil and gas loans. During the quarter, many customers successfully exited prior pandemic related deferral programs. The underlying portfolio metrics reflect our continued expectation for outperformance through the cycle. Our credit loss reserves take into consideration the economic uncertainty that we continue to have the virus both in duration and severity. We believe we're adequately covered should the pandemic continue to prolong the economic recovery. Our capital ratios remain within our targeted ranges. This morning we announced that the Board declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common share unchanged from the prior quarter. We are currently finalizing our submission for the off-cycle CCAR. We are seeking approval and expect to increase our capital return to shareholders in 2021. In closing, I am encouraged by the momentum I can see building across our businesses. Our colleagues are actively engaging with our customers and prospects, customer activity is improving month-by-month, we see improved debit card activity, sales activity in the branches is almost back to pre-COVID levels and our pipelines have been replenished in many of our businesses over the past several months. We recently made some key additions to our commercial team notably within our Asset Finance Capital Markets and Corporate Banking teams and have conversations ongoing with additional revenue producers. We're seeing very, very positive feedback and early results from the new 24-hour Grace for business and the $50 Safety Zone product features for consumers and businesses that we rolled out in September. Our credit quality through the early months of this pandemic has held up well and we're confident in the quality of our loan portfolios. I am conscious that the economic outlook remains somewhat uncertain in the near-term but overall and likewise and optimistic about our outlook over time. Now let me turn it over to Zach for an overview of financial performance. Zach? Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve and good morning everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the 2020 third quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.27. Return on average assets was 1.01% and return on average tangible common equity was 13.2%. Results continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense as we added $57 million to the reserve during the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our results in more detail. Year-over-year pre-tax pre-provision earnings growth was 2%. We believe this is a solid performance in light of the current interest rate environment and uncertain economic outlook. Total revenue increased 5% versus the year ago quarter, due to the strong fee income growth paired with modest spread revenue growth. As Steve mentioned earlier, home lending was a particular bright spot this quarter, driving a record $122 million of mortgage banking income. We also saw deposit service charges, and card and payment processing revenues rebound off the 2Q lows as customer activity continued to rebound and pandemic related fee waiver programs expired. I should also note that deposit service charges remain below the year-ago level as elevated consumer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line. Total expenses were higher by $45 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, approximately 2 percentage points of this growth or $15 million was driven by restructuring costs from our 2020 expense management program, another 3 percentage points, or $18 million was related to year-over-year increases in commissions over time, contract help and other variable costs in our home lending business driven by the record level of mortgage originations. The balance of the expense growth, approximately 2% reflected a sustained level of investment in our strategic priorities including digital and mobile technology. Turning now to Slide 7, FTE net interest income increased 2% as earning asset growth more than offset year-over-year NIM compression. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 2.96% as shown in the block on the right side of the slide, the linked quarter increase included a 7-basis point benefit from our hedging program, including the fourth quarter impact of the $1.6 billion of forward starting asset hedges that became active in the second quarter. There was also a 2-basis point benefit during the third quarter related to changes in balance sheet mix and other items. These two positive impacts were partially offset by the elevated balance sheet liquidity that contributed a 7-basis point incremental headwind in the third quarter. As Steve mentioned, we're taking decisive actions to maintain the net interest margin near current levels while we are diligently working across the organization to identify and pull levers to manage the margin. It's important to note that our core optimization objective is revenue growth with the highest possible return on capital within our risk appetite. That said, NIM is one of the key drivers of that return and revenue growth, so we're actively managing various levers to stabilize the NIM as a key component in that calculus. We expect to continue to optimize our funding costs including further reductions to deposit costs and optimizing our wholesale funding. On the earning asset side, we're currently in the midst of a broad re-examination of all business and lending commercial relationships for repricing opportunities that I believe will yield several basis points of incremental NIM over time as well as associated deepening of non-interest income fee opportunities. Similarly, we are optimizing our earning asset mix by emphasizing loan production in certain higher yielding asset classes such as small business, residential mortgage, asset-backed lending, equipment leasing while de-emphasizing growth in some of our thinner priced lending products. Finally, our comprehensive hedging strategies continue to provide some relief from the yield curve as we expect they will continue to do for the next several years. While this hedging benefit will begin to gradually wane over the next several years, there are no looming cliffs as we have strategically built a well-laddered hedging portfolio. Moving to Slide 8, average earning assets increased to $11 billion or 11% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the $6 billion of PPP loans and a $5 billion increase in deposits of the Fed. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 13% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. During the quarter, C&I benefited from a full quarter's impact of the PPP loans; however, downward pressure on the business and commercial utilization rates, especially within dealer floor plan more than offset this resulting in a modest linked quarter decline. Consumer lending has also been a bright spot this year as indirect auto, residential mortgage and our RV marine portfolios have posted steady growth, a trend we expect to persist in coming quarters. Turning to Slide 9, we will review the deposit growth. Average core deposits increased 14% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. These increases were driven by business and commercial growth related to the PPP loans and increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn, consumer growth largely related to the government stimulus and increased consumer and business banking account production and reduced account attrition. Like the industry as a whole, this is very strong core deposit growth in the past several quarters has resulted in significantly elevated levels of deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. These elevated levels of liquidity have proven to be much stickier than we anticipated and our revised outlook is that they are likely to persist for several quarters before these customers deploy the funds. While this did pressure in the Q3 NIM more than originally expected, it is also providing us the opportunity to more aggressively manage down our deposit costs going forward. Slide 10 highlights the more granular trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations and debit card spend as these are key indicators of behavior and economic activity amongst our customers. As you can see on the top left chart, the decline in commercial loan balances excluding PPP loans leveled off in July and remained relatively flat during the third quarter. Early stage pipelines are refilling providing room for optimism of a return to new commercial loan growth later this year and into next year. We expect this coupled with the expected gradual normalization of commercial utilization rates and the typical seasonal build in dealer floor plan will provide some offset from the headwinds from PPP loans as they are forgiven and repaid over the next several quarters. The top right chart reflects the continued elevated deposit balances resulting from the factors I've mentioned previously, providing attractive source of liquidity during these uncertain times. The bottom two charts relate to customer activity driving two of the four key fee income lines for us. Mortgage banking salable originations remain robust, although there has been a very slow decline since the peak in June. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, debit card usage quickly rebounded once the economy began to be re-open and we continue to see healthy year-over-year increases in both transactions and dollar spend. Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1 ended the quarter at 9.89%, relatively stable with last quarter. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 7.27% again in line with last quarter. Both ratios remain within our operating guidelines and our strong capital levels position us well to execute on growth initiatives and investment opportunities. Let me now turn it over to Rich Pohle to cover credit. Rich? Rich Pohle : Thanks Zach. I first like to reinforce the steps we've taken over the last several years to position us for this downturn. In commercial, we scaled back leverage lending, health care, construction and commercial real estate. We stopped originating oil and gas loans about 18 months ago and reduced debt portfolio to well under 1% of total loans. We have also repositioned our business banking portfolio with a significant reduction in commercial real estate exposure and a shift toward SBA as about 20% of our loans are now SBA as opposed to only about 5% heading into the last downturn. We were the number one bank in the entire country last year for SBA 7(a) originations for the third consecutive year. On the consumer side, we had continued our focus on prime and super-prime profile customers and leveraged our expertise in auto into our RV marine business. Turning now to the credit results and metrics. Slide 12 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or ACL from year-end 2019 to the third quarter. You can see our ACL now represents 2.31% of loans and excluding the PPP loan balances, our ACL would be 2.5% as of September 30. The third quarter allowance represents a modest $57 million reserve build in the second quarter. Like the previous quarters in 2020, there are multiple data points used to size the provision expense for Q3. The primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the August baseline forecast. This scenario was somewhat improved from the May baseline forecast we used in Q2 and assumes elevated unemployment through 2020 ending the year at 9.5% followed by a slower paced economic recovery through the first half of 2021 that accelerates as the year progresses. 2020 GDP for the full year down 4.9% and demonstrates 2.6% growth for all of 2021 with that growth also accelerating in the back half of the year. While a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario has improved, as of our credit metrics for the quarter, there are still many uncertainties to deal with, the likely COVID a resurgence in the winter, a stalemate on additional economic stimulus, the impact of these coming upcoming election as well as ongoing model imperfections relating to the COVID economic forecasting. We believe maintaining coverage ratios consistent with the second quarter is prudent when considering these factors. Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the continued impact that our oil and gas portfolio has had on our overall level of NPAs. Oil and Gas NPAs for Q3 represented 26% of our overall NPAs which were down from the second quarter by $111 million or 16% as we proactively reduced the oil and gas portfolio and were able to return other credits to accruing status. Slide 14 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we provided to our commercial customers. As we forecasted on our Q2 call, the commercial deferrals have dropped significantly and now total just $942 million, down from $5 billion at June 30, about 80% of the remaining deferrals represent second 90-day deferrals that are centered on hospitality, retail and travel related customers. Over 70% of the remaining deferrals expire this month and we expect to have limited commercial deferral balances at the end of Q4. Some SBA customers might seek an initial deferral in Q4 following the end of the six-month payment support the SBA provided under the CARES Act. Commercial delinquencies are within a normal range at 19 basis points reinforcing the deferrals have not negatively impacted credit quality. Slide 15 shows our consumer deferrals and the news here is good as well. Our auto, RV marine and HELOC portfolios are performing as we would have expected with very modest close deferral delinquencies, in fact, nearly all the auto, RV marine, HELOC deferrals have lapsed and we are operating in a pre-COVID risk management environment with respect to those portfolios. The mortgage accommodations have come down 78% since June and are also meeting our expectations. Request for second deferrals or further modifications equal just 10% of the post deferral population today. Mortgage deferrals will remain elevated for the next quarter or so given the longer additional deferral period 180 days in many cases versus 90 for other loans, as well as the more formal deferral exit process which requires a second round of documentation with wet signatures and deliveries. Like the commercial deferrals, the consumer deferrals are not indicating additional credit risk at this time. Consumer delinquencies were down across all loan categories on a year-over-year basis. Slide 16 provides an update to the industries hardest hit by COVID-19. We continue regular reviews of our commercial loan portfolio and we believe we have the risks identified and appropriately managed. Any adverse COVID impacts, as well as the most recent SNIC exam results are reflected in our [trip] class and other credit metrics for the quarter. As we had previously mentioned, our hotel exposure centered on five primary sponsors with most of whom we've enjoyed long-term relationships, including through the last downturn, these sponsors continue to demonstrate the financial strength to see their way through the longer-term recovery period we forecast for this industry. Our restaurant exposure is primarily in the national quick service brands. We believe this book to be in very good shape overall while we continue to closely monitor the heightened risk at a single location and other non-franchise names in the portfolio. There are currently no material credit concerns in the other high-impact portfolios and you can see that the credit metrics since June are relatively stable. Recall in the second quarter as part of our active portfolio management process, we evaluated the COVID related impacts across all portfolios and took appropriate actions to downgrade those severely impacted credits to criticized status. This review resulted in a significant increase to our criticized asset level in Q2. I am pleased to report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over $425 million or 12% in the third quarter validating that the portfolio review we undertook in Q2 was comprehensive and served to identify potential problems early. Working with our customers, we're able to proactively remedy a number of these loans. Slide 17 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance overall was strong. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 56 basis points of average loans and leases. The commercial charge-offs were again centered in the oil and gas portfolio, which made up approximately 44% of the total commercial net charge-offs. Like Q2, nearly all these oil and gas charge offs resulted from $127 million of loan sales closed or contracted for sale during the quarter as we prudently reduced our exposure to this industry. Annualized net charge-offs excluding the oil and gas-related losses were 36 basis points, demonstrating that the balance of our portfolio continued to perform well in Q3. Consumer charge-offs were just 24 basis points in Q3, highlighting our strong consumer portfolio. Our super-prime originations of auto and RV marine loans in particular continue to perform at very high levels. I would also add our non-performing asset ratio decreased 15 basis points linked quarter to 74 basis points. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. Let me turn it back over to Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thank you, Rich. As Steve alluded to earlier, we have confidence in our businesses and are cautiously optimistic that the economic recovery will continue, particularly longer term as we move past the election and with the potential for vaccine and improved therapeutic medical treatments for the virus. We also expect to finish out 2020 strong and Slide 18 provides our expectations for the full year of 2020. Looking at the average balance sheet for the full year 2020, we expect average loans and average deposits to increase approximately 6% and 10% respectively compared to last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect consumer loans, more specifically residential mortgage, auto, RV marine to be the primary driver of average loan growth as commercial loan growth remains muted. Our current projections assume the majority of PPP balances will remain on balance sheet through the end of the year. With respect to deposits, we expect continued growth in consumer core deposits from new customer acquisition, relationship deepening and low attrition. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the elevated level of business and commercial deposits to persist through year-end. We expect to record full-year total revenue growth of approximately 3% to 3.5% and full-year total expense growth of 2% to 2.5%. With respect to revenues, we expect Q4 revenues to be in line with Q3, up 7% to 8% year-over-year. We expect full year NIM to be approximately 300 basis points and we expect a flat to moderately higher NIM in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by further reductions to the cost of interest-bearing deposits, which we expect to be below our prior historic low of 22 basis points that we set back in the third quarter of 2016. This guidance includes no positive impact in Q4 from the acceleration of PPP fees and includes a continuation of elevated liquidity that we discussed earlier. We expect full year non-interest income growth of 8% to 10% primarily driven by robust mortgage income while our fourth quarter outlook includes moderation in mortgage banking. We expect an uptick in capital markets fees as well as several other fee lines to help to cushion that decline. On expenses, we expect the fourth quarter to be up 3% to 5% from the third quarter. As we've discussed before, we believe the current economic outlook presents the opportunity to invest in our businesses in order to meaningfully gain share and accelerate growth over the moderate term as the recovery continues to solidify. As such, we're accelerating investments in technology and other key strategic initiatives across our businesses as we exit 2020 while delivering full year positive operating leverage for the eight consecutive year. Finally, our credit remains fundamentally sound. We expect full year net charge-offs to be approximately 50 basis points to 55 basis points. This is reflective of the cleanup of the oil and gas portfolio as well as the broader economic conditions. Now let me turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up, and then if that person has any additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : I think you guys actually answered a lot of my questions on the sort of the potential for commercial to - kind of resume some growth. So I certainly appreciate that. I wanted to ask specifically on the dealer business, that's been kind of a headwind and kind of is not necessarily huge for you guys? But was just curious to hear about your thoughts on sort of any window and as to how quickly we should expect that dealer business in particular to recover. In other words, how much of a growth driver can it end up being? Rich Pohle : Scott, it's Rich, I'll take that. We've seen really low utilization rates across the dealer floor plan portfolio, what has been typically in the 75% range are now down below 50%. The challenge with that business is just getting inventory back on the lots and while the OEMs are ramping up deliveries to the dealers, new car levels are continuing at pretty low levels. So, we would expect that we would see a steady build from that 50% up towards the end of the year. And provide a gradual build over the year. This isn't something that's going to ramp up very quickly, but it is going to be something that we see steady state and slowly building throughout the balance of 2020 and into 2021. Scott Siefers : And then and Zach, just on the guidance for the full year, and I guess implicit in the fourth quarter. If I'm doing the math correctly, I think the implied NII in the fourth quarter would be up fairly significantly from the third quarter, it sounds like margin sort of flattish. I guess just what are the puts and takes that you see for NII in particular in the fourth quarter? Zach Wasserman : Sure yes, thanks again for the question. So, I think our outlook for loans sequentially is up in total about 1% or $800 million. We are expecting our kind of baseline underlying forecast is a couple basis points of incremental NIM as we go into Q4. And so that's really going to drive spread revenues up around $30 million. To be clear, it does not include any PPP acceleration, there could be, some revenues come through from that, but we're not banking on that. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. And it's - not baked in, so that was the following so, all right terrific. Thank you very much. Zach Wasserman : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Question for either Rich or Zach on the provision, can you talk about some of the provision drivers for the quarter and what you want the overall message to be as we look forward on that. It seems like some of this was growth driven as well, but can you just talk about provision drivers and expectations? Rich Pohle : Sure Jon, it's Rich, I'll start with that. Yes as you pointed out, we did have a relatively modest reserve build in Q3, it was about 3% from Q2. The coverage ratio moved up four basis points from 227 basis points to 231 basis points. I would first point out that we did have over $1 billion in point-to-point loan growth in Q3 which accounted for about 25% of that reserve build. Clearly with CECL, you are taking a life of loan approach to any - loss about to any portfolio build that you have. But I would tie the build really to ongoing uncertainty with respect to both the virus and the type of stimulus if any that's coming our way. We are seeing COVID cases increasing across much of our footprint, and while we don't expect a return to full stay at home orders. We do believe that is going to be a drag on the economy going forward. And with respect to stimulus, we can see that there is a deadlock right now and the timing and the makeup of what that stimulus ends up looking like is going to be important to the recovery. I think you have to keep in mind too that all of the economic scenarios have assumptions with respect to both the dollar amount and the timing of stimulus. And to the extent that - that stimulus is delayed or isn't earmarked for where the model thinks it's going. It's going to have also an impact. So when we look at factoring all of that in, the uncertainty that's what really drove us to keep the reserve about where it was, I think at four basis points is pretty much a plateau for the quarter. Those were the big drivers. Jon Arfstrom : But the message, I hear is adequately reserved for what you see today. I have heard that a couple of months. Is that fair? Zach Wasserman : That's - absolutely. Jon Arfstrom : And then just one small one, it's kind of, it's the noise in your numbers at this point, but quarter your non-performers, about half the charge-offs for oil and gas? Zach you use the term cleanup, what's left there and what's kind of the timing on that? Steve Steinour : Yes, I think we just have - we sold $127 million in the third quarter. We've got that portfolio down 50% from where it was a year ago. When we talk about clean up, the book right now is that the point where with the reserves that we have, we will be opportunistic sellers. I think over the course of the last several quarters, there was more of a desire to get the overall numbers down and the pricing that we were able to get allowed us to do that within the coverage ratio that we had. I don't believe in the fourth quarter that we're going to be aggressive sellers. We will certainly look to sell if it makes sense and to the extent that the fall borrowing base redeterminations require additional charge-offs, we will take them. So, we're going to move into what I would consider more of a traditional problem loan management scenario with oil and gas going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Steve, my first question is for you. Out of all your DFAST participant peers, I think this is probably the first statement we've heard in terms of expectations to increase capital return in 2021 assuming restrictions don't stretch out for too long. And knowing the bank, you've always prioritized dividend, dividend growth and also of course funding your growth. And I'm wondering if that balance shifts a little bit to buybacks in 2021 given where your stock is relative to your return potential? Steve Steinour : Thank you, Erika. We do have a relatively high dividend yield compared to the peer group and that will influence at the appropriate time what I believe are Board's decisions. We would be more oriented towards buyback versus a dividend increase. But no decision, we are not at that threshold yet, but the historic guidance we would have provided will substitute - will likely substitute other uses of capital as a second alternative. And that dividend is balance with that. Historically, I would say core growth dividend and other uses you'll see a much more balanced approach. Certainly with the stock trading at these levels that seems to, make a lot of sense to us, again subject to Fed and other regulatory support. Erika Najarian : And my second question is for Zach. I think of course there was some chatter about swap income potentially rolling off and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there are no looming cliffs. And if I'm doing the back of the envelope math right the derivative book helped net interest income about maybe $19 million to $20 million this quarter, and of course, correct me if I'm wrong? And I'm wondering as we think about the outlook for 2022 in your well laddered strategy, what is the dollar impact from the derivative portfolio if you could confirm for this quarter and what you expect it to be for 2021? Zach Wasserman : I hope the dollar - probably would have basis points. In 2020 for the full year, the derivative portfolio is benefiting us by about 22 basis points. Next year, we expect that to rise somewhat, that's several basis points up to 25 basis points. And then it's sort of gradually runs off through 2022, 2023 and 2024. I think 2022 is about 12 basis points to 13 basis points run-off, 2023 is about seven basis points run-off and then 2024 is actually flat. So there is no massive cliff, there's clearly a drop and a gradual reduction over time, but as I also mentioned in my prepared remarks. We're pulling all the levers of balance sheet optimizations to really offset and drive that and we do have confidence. We'll further in near current levels over the long-term, leveraging three key strategies; funding optimization, asset growth mix and that customer level pricing. Last thing I'll say just pull back and see if that answers your question. For next year there will likely be a fair amount of quarter-to-quarter volatility driven by PPP loan forgiveness acceleration, we'll see, but we suspect that that will be in the first couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Following up on the expense side, Zach, you mentioned three to five expense growth in the fourth quarter and I think you said it was mostly investment, just wondering can you help us just understand what were the restructuring costs that were in the third quarter number and also what you're expecting in the fourth quarter number? Zach Wasserman : Sure. In the third quarter we have $15 million of restructuring costs. In the fourth, we expect that to be kind of around or just less than $5 million. So, it's sort of incremental $10 million benefit quarter-to-quarter within that 3% to 5% expense guide. I would tell you just pulling back that really the investments are essentially entirely driven by that investment growth. So, the expenses are essentially driven by that investment growth. We see a little bit of continued quarter-to-quarter growth in variable cost just driven by customer activity continuing to rebound out of the COVID lows, but those are the main drivers. Ken Usdin : And then so, if I take that then that there's not much restructuring costs in that fourth quarter number, is that kind of the right base to grow off or it is just more of a one-time step up that just get stuff accelerated or in relative to what you expect to spend as you go forward to your prior comments last quarter about the flexibility within the cost save numbers? Zach Wasserman : Yes, it's a good question and I know where your mind is going. Let me, so, it's a little too early for us to give you kind of a longer-term outlook. We'll do that more fulsomely in the next quarter update when we talk in January. But I think that what you're going to see is this elevated level of investments continuing for a few more quarters, you cannot turn on the dime with this kind of stuff. So, we're going to, we're ramping up towards the end of this year as we've talked about over time to capture the opportunities that are, we think are present in the recovery and that will sustain for a few more quarters, but the key for us is really if these things drive revenue growth. We have a very focused investment plan, very tied to our strategic growth initiatives and the expectation is we'll start to see the benefits of that flowing through to accelerating revenue growth as we go throughout '21 and certainly into '22. Ken Usdin : Okay and then just one underneath that. What's also, I think, Steve mentioned a bunch of this in his prepared remarks, but like how do you go forward and help offset some of that natural inflation from the spending in terms of things you can either see starting to become more efficient in or, as Steve mentioned earlier, you start to rethink some of the branch locations over time, et cetera? Zach Wasserman : Yes, I mean you saw it tick down, I think that is right there, I think the investments we've got some of which drive shorter-term and more productivity related benefits, others are longer term and customer acquisition and customer relationship deepening related and behind the scenes we just continue to be incredibly rigorous with our non-investments expense program and I think the way I look at expenses is if you've got growth investments and you deny if you drive the return on that, and you've got the rest of the business expenses that we just squeezed perpetually lower. So the items look at are a lot of what you just said. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David George with Baird. Please proceed with your question. David George : I had a question just moving to the fee side of things, there was a good rebound this quarter in deposit service charges. I am just kind of curious how you're thinking about that line item in Q4 and then kind of a run rate starting in 2021 obviously given the amount of liquidity that - that is in consumer checking accounts, that's going to put a damper on it, but I would imagine that the spend has gotten better, so that that's obviously driving some of the improvements. So, I'm curious how you're thinking about that? Zach Wasserman : Yes, this is Zach, I will take that and perhaps others may want to weigh in as well. So, we did see a bit of a snapback in personal service charges in Q3 by $15 million higher, although it was - continues to run a fair amount lower than last year. As we look forward in the future, I don't expect a lot of growth in that line. I think that the, particularly the elevated levels of deposits that we've seen, I for one believe is they are going to be quite sticky for some time. I think it's fundamentally related to peoples' uncertainty about the economy and therefore just protecting themselves with elevated liquidity. Again we've seen kind of a flight to quality and flight to proximity from our customers and leveraging Huntington as a place to hold those deposits. So, I think that's going to hold personal service charges lower for a while. It's really not our focus for growth. We're really driving the value-added fee lines over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zerbe : So, one of your peers decided to recently exit indirect auto, can you just talk about the economics of that business and how the economics has changed since the beginning of the pandemic? Rich Pohle : Yes, Ken, this is Rich. I'll take a stab at that. We love the indirect auto business. I mean this is a foundation and a core competency that we've had for several years now, and we would grow this business as opposed to exit it. The credit quality performs incredibly well through DFAST, it's our, one of our best performing portfolios. I think if you look at the recent deferral activity that we've had in this book in the post deferral delinquencies, they are excellent and right in line with that. So from a credit standpoint, we couldn't be happier with the performance of this portfolio over time and we're very enthusiastic about the growth of this business over time. So, we have a contrarian approach and I think it's based on the fact that we've got great dealer relationships we've built up over the years and that is proven out very well. So, Zach, you want to touch on that. Zach Wasserman : I totally agree with everything Rich has said. This business has incredible risk-adjusted returns, to give you a sense of the yields we're seeing right now, new volumes coming in are 3.5%, so it's sort of constructive and helpful for the NIM trajectory. It's also relatively short-lived asset, so it helps us continue to play as rates potentially move higher over the longer term and it will allow I would say just - we come into this business new, it's great to see these business lines that Huntington has that are, we've got such a diversification of the business as we got that when something else is weak like commercial that we talked about this other one has been really a real source of strength and growth for us. So, yes, could not say enough about how much we like it. Ken Zerbe : And then just the second question, you guys talked about seeing growth in commercial later this year. I think you referenced it a few times. Just to be clear, is this specifically a Huntington's specific like issue that you're growing C&I or is this or do you envision the broader industry also growing C&I off a low base? Rich Pohle : We haven't. We are not in a position to comment on the industry, but we're looking at our pipeline, what we're making and sharing that comment Ken. We have a pipeline today that's comparable to last year in both business banking and our commercial banking teams and typically fourth quarter is a, is one of our best quarters year in year out. I would expect based on the waiting of that pipeline probability of closing to have pretty good fourth quarter and all indications are positive. What we're, we're hearing from customers is a continuing recovery, remember the Midwest is recovering nicely, particularly the manufacturing sector. The biggest issue we hear in that regard is they just can't get enough employees. Our jobs numbers for the Midwest are higher than any other region in the country. So, this is a labor issue that's constraining some of the potential on the investment side and maybe holding back some the loan demand. So we're actually reasonably bullish about fourth quarter and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : Just back on the loan growth topic, on the commercial side, I appreciate the color you just gave in terms of the, in your markets and, and some of the trends, outside of dealer services from an industry perspective, where are you seeing the improving growth dynamics. Is it, is it manufacturing like you just said, is that where you're starting to see demand or is that you're just optimistic of that materializing? Are there other portfolios where you are seeing some momentum begin? Rich Pohle : We're clearly seeing it in the manufacturing sector John as I mentioned, but it's more broadly based. There is a level of business activity that's occurring on the buyout side, on generational transfers, beyond that there is activity that we're, we're, remember we're principally a lower-middle market bank in the commercial side and as inventories are getting replenished and revenues rebuilt, there is working capital demand. We do a lot of equipment finance and asset-based lending as well. We've seen particularly in the asset base side good demand, fourth quarter is generally good for equipment finance, our health care activity is very, very strong as well. So it's - it's broad based. Zach Wasserman : Just to talk on this, this is Zach, as an indication of that, the pipelines are up to almost the level of last year, just to give you a sense, off considerably lower including during COVID, so, and production during the quarter, during Q3 ramps quite substantially. John Pancari : Yes. Got it. No, that's helpful, thanks for that added color there. And then on the, on the credit side, just to confirm did you indicate that you're criticized assets are down, did you say 12% in the quarter, and also, could you just talk about what areas that you saw improvement and if you think that decline can continue where do you think there's is going to be some pressure to the upside as some of the pressure on borrowers as they come off forbearance and uncertainty on stimulus weighs in? Zach Wasserman : Yes, 12% was right. It was about $425 million was the reduction over the quarter. It was very wide widespread. We did have the oil and gas sales, which was about $125 million or $127 million, all of that. Just about all that was, was criticized. But beyond that, it was very broad based across just about all of our lines of business, which was heartening to see. We did do that very comprehensive review in the second quarter, which caused the spike in credit in Q2 and so seeing it come down in Q3, we expected that to some extent and I would say that we will continue to see a downward trend in criticized, it may be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter, things will move in, things will move out within different portfolios. I think that's just the kind of the COVID environment that we're dealing and things are going to pop up that might be somewhat unexpected. But I would generally expect our credit quality to begin migrating - the credit class migrating down over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Bill Carcache : Rich, following up on your auto segment comments, it looks like you guys had recently been seeing a growing mix of used car originations, but we saw a mix shift back to new this quarter, I think that was on Slide 44. Can you discuss some of the dynamics there and give us a sense of the relative profitability of new versus used just at a high level? Zach Wasserman : Yes, I think, this is Zach, I'll start off. [Indiscernible] yield numbers right in front of me, but I think generally this is really influenced by the supply dynamics which I was talking about earlier. So, earlier in the year when the supply interruptions were had on the original equipment side, demand naturally shifted to the - to the used side and so we saw that mix change and I think what you're seeing now is the gradual normalization back to a kind of a longer-term typical mix of new versus used cars. The yield on use is a bit higher than new, but I don't have the numbers right in front of me to comment more specifically, we might be able to follow-up with you on that. Rich Pohle : Yes, Bill, I don't have the specific breakout on the yields between new and used, but used is always quite a bit higher than new. And so on a risk adjusted return basis, it's actually slightly better than the new. Bill Carcache : Yes, thanks guys and then separately Zach, on your comments around mix optimization and remixing more towards small business in particular. Can you discuss how you guys are thinking about growing into that from - relationship, from a customer relationship standpoint, timing, credit risk perspective, particularly with all the uncertainty around stimulus? Zach Wasserman : Yes, maybe I'll touch on that a little bit, then Rich maybe attack on as well. I think - and the list of assets we'd like to grow faster, it includes small business but it's not certainly exclusive to that as we noted a lot of others. But I think what we're seeing, our strategy is to really deepen penetration and provide terrific products and experiences to this segment, particularly through the digital investments we're making. And we're really seeing it works, there is a tremendous demand coming through. I think partly leveraging the real success we have with PPP. And so it's pretty broad-based. I want to Rich to attack on in terms how we're thinking about. Rich Pohle : No absolutely the PPP success that we had - certainly the driver of the growth and we are really focused on SBA within small business as a continued lever for growth. We obviously have a core competency in SBA and we will continue to leverage that going forward, but also on the conventional side, business banking which, the non-SBA piece of it, we've seen very good growth as well and that's been pretty widespread across industries, healthcare and others. Bill Carcache : Thanks Rich in fact if I could squeeze one last one in for Steve. You guys have done a lot to improve HBAN's ROTCE profile since the great recession. Can you discuss your expectations for the kind of ROTCE generation that we can expect from HBAN to the extent that so were to persist for an extended period? Steve Steinour : Well, we haven't changed our long-term metrics on ROTCE at this point. We'll be out as Zach mentioned with an outlook for next year in January. So I think that's fair to use based on the work that we've done looking forward over the next couple of years - as a rough guideline now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Janet Lee : This is Janet Lee on for Steve. My first question is on margin obviously lots of moving pieces there, but if I put it altogether, with assets liquidity remaining elevated near term and fixed asset repricing. Looking into 2021 is the direction of NIM modest downward trend from here or do you think you can manage it more stable given hedges benefit? Zach Wasserman : Yes, good question. Thank you, this is Zach. I'll take that one. So, I think 2020 will likely land around 300 basis points, from just a tick higher and our expectation for 2021 excluding PPP for a second is just a few ticks higher than that. So about flat and my baseline outlook is a few basis points higher, we'll have. I think I mentioned earlier, kind of the next few years, hedge benefits in basis points this year was 22 basis points, next year is 25 basis points, absolutely normal forecast that's up three basis points better. Interest bearing liabilities I expect to be down also kind of over, around or over 30 basis points. We do expect yield pressure largely offsetting that, so that is sort of flat to a few basis points higher outlook I have got for 2021 at this point. Again, we're continuing to do a fair bit of work around decimals in fact both her guidance later. There are wildcards, there is the PPP timing that I mentioned, there is potentially also some. We'll continue to look at hedging in the portfolio and that could also throw a few basis points volatility in there, but generally that's my outlook. Janet Lee : And my next question is on operating leverage. So, when we combine with expense savings from the branch consolidations and I guess more bullish outlook on loans going into 4Q. Do you see it increasingly likely that Huntington can achieve positive operating leverage in 2021 again? Steve Steinour : No, it's really too early for us to talk about the totality of the full year of 2021. I do expect a lot of the trends that we're seeing right now to kind of continue for the next few quarters just given the momentum and the trend of the businesses that we're seeing right now. And so we'll see, we'll come back and talk more about that. Our commitment around positive operating leverage is a long-term one. And we think it's the right one for the company, but we're really focused on making the investments now to drive revenue acceleration and I tell you we feel pretty good about it. So, we'll come back and talk more in a few months. Zach Wasserman : So Steve, we're bullish about coming out of this cycle and taking advantage of it, that has been our orientation in the best and we're continuing with that. So, we'll be looking to drive growth, revenue growth, and you're getting a sense of that off the third quarter earnings. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Brock Vandervliet : Just in terms of lost content in the cadence of net charge-offs going forward. One, I guess how are you feeling about loss content now versus say April, I'm assuming that's better but wanted to ask. And then two, as you look at charge-offs, they've been relatively stable here is there a bit of a catch-up, in other words, an increase from here that we should continue to be aware of or are you anticipating that we can kind of hold at this, more at this level? Steve Steinour : Brock, this is Steve, just to go to your April comments, night and day are different, when I think about the volatility and uncertainty in that period of time versus today. So you should be inferring that off the comments about the economy and recovery, et cetera, and that would be true with an expectation of credit quality will mirror the economic recovery. There is still uncertainty and as Rich said it maybe lumpy. But we don't have a catch-up quarter, we've already caught up. So, we're in good shape as at the end of the third quarter, given the volatility and expect that the team will manage with consistency as we go forward, may be a little lumpy because of the recovery and the nature of it and the virus, but like the footing we have very much. Brock Vandervliet : The mix optimization, could you look to move some of this Fed deposits into investment securities or is that not something you're looking at? Zach Wasserman : Yes, so this is Zach. It's really not something we're looking at, at this time. We do expect to begin to reinvest our securities cash flow this quarter as we've talked about a little bit over the last few calls and to get back in the securities portfolio to around Q1 levels. So that's about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion of incremental securities investments in the fourth quarter, but not really with the mind towards utilizing those deposits. Rather, we are focused on deploying those for core organic growth and to some degree as a funding optimization opportunity that I mentioned earlier. So, that is the plan. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Steinour for closing comments. Steve Steinour : So thank you for the questions and your interest in Huntington. We're very pleased with the third quarter performance and we continue to be optimistic about our future and the economic recovery, but acknowledge volatility uncertainty remain in the economy. Our disciplined enterprise risk management provides a strong fundamental foundation and you're seeing that in our numbers. We're executing our strategies and will continue to capitalize on opportunities. We're investing - investing in strategic growth initiatives while continuing to deliver solid performance. I'm confident of our ability to manage the challenges we face and excited about our future. And finally as I thought of reminding you, we are closely aligned of the interests of the Board, executive management and colleagues with the other owners of the company via mechanisms, such as our hold to retirement, equity requirements. And we've collectively been one of the 10 largest shareholders of the company for the past five years. So, we feel to pay and we're looking forward to a better day ahead. Thank you again for your support and interest in Huntington, have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thank you, Melissa. Welcome, I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one-hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle Chief Credit Officer. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington\u2019s strategy to build the leading People-First, Digitally-Powered bank in the nation. Our 2020 results demonstrate we are driving revenue growth despite headwinds. We are focused on acquiring new customers and deepening those relationships to gain both market share and share of wallet. We are investing in customer-centric products, services and digital technologies that will drive sustainable growth and the outperformance both today and for years to come. Huntington operates in intentionally diversified business models, balanced between commercial and consumer, which provides the good mix of revenue and credit exposure. We\u2019ve built competitive advantage with our consistently superior customer service and our differentiated products and services. We are committed to developing best-in-class digital capabilities like our mobile banking App, which has been recognized as the highest in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power two years in a row. In 2020, we introduced several new innovative products and features that will continue to serve our customers' needs and differentiating Huntington from our competition. We are not done. We have a pipeline of innovative products and features that we will release throughout the year. We have a proven track record of solid execution, adjusting our operating plans to the environment in order to drive shareholder returns. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve and good morning everyone. Slides 4 and 5 provides the financial highlights for the full year 2020 and the fourth quarter respectively. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $0.27. Return on average assets was 1.04% and return on average tangible common equity was 13.3%. Results continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense, although it was down meaningfully from the third quarter.  Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our results in a little more detail. Annual pre-tax pre-provision earnings growth was 4% for 2020. We believe this is a very solid performance in light of the low interest rate environment and the economic challenges inflicted by the pandemic illustrating the underlying earnings power of the bank and the strategies we are executing. Rich Pohle : Thanks Zach. Before we get into the credit results for the quarter and the entire year, I wanted to reinforce the disciplined credit approach we have followed over the years that has allowed our portfolio to come through this downturn with solid performance. This was due to the foundation we\u2019ve been laying for a decade now beginning with instilling a cohesive culture that everyone in the company owns risk. We reduced our commercial real estate portfolio from over 200% of capital to under 8% and curtailed pre-construction lending such that the fourth quarter represents the lowest level of construction in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of capital that we had since the FirstMerit acquisition in 2016. This low leveraged lending originations in 2019 and ended 2020 with leveraged loans virtually flat from year end 2018.  We transitioned our healthcare portfolio to diversify away from long-term care into more publicly held products and services companies and investment-grade hospital systems, which together now make up 45% of the healthcare portfolio.  On the consumer side, we brought our expertise in indirect auto to our RV marine business and reduced our exposure to second-lien high LTV home equity. These steps and many others have fundamentally transformed the makeup of the Huntington loan portfolios since the last downturn. I am also extremely pleased with the impact of our 2020 portfolio management activities.  First, we reduced our oil and gas portfolio by $780 million or 59% since September 2019. The non-core portion of this portfolio has been reduced to just $243 million. We performed a thorough portfolio review in 2Q that resulted in a net $1.1 billion increase to our criticized loans and put heightened visibility on these and other high impact credits.  Since 2Q, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our credit class by $771 million by working with our customers while at the same time effectively managing risk. Finally, our total consumer and commercial delinquency numbers are better than a year ago. We manage nearly $6 billion of loans with payment deferrals ending the year with just $217 million of loans with the remaining deferral.  Turning now to the credit results and metrics. Slide 12 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses from yearend 2019 to yearend 2020. You can see our ACL now represents 2.29% of loans. The fourth quarter allowance represents a modest $12 million reserve release from the third quarter. Like the previous quarters in 2020, there are multiple data points used to size the provision expense for the fourth quarter. The primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the November baseline forecast. This scenario was much improved from the August baseline forecast we used in 3Q and assumes unemployment in 2020 ending the year at 7.2% and increasing to 7.5% for the first three quarters of 2021 to average 7.4% for the entire year. 2020 GDP ends the full year down 3.6% and demonstrates 4.1% growth for all of 2021 with that growth peaking at 5.8% in the fourth quarter. While a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario has improved, as that many of our credit metrics for the quarter, there were still many uncertainties to deal with at December 31. The impact of the COVID resurgence we face today, the smaller than expected economic stimulus package, and ongoing model challenges related to COVID economic forecasting. We believe maintaining coverage ratios consistent with the third quarter is prudent when considering these factors. Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the continued but more limited impacts that our oil and gas portfolio has on our overall level of NPAs. We expect modest gas credit impacts as we head into 2021. So this will be the last time we break out this portfolio within our overall credit results.  In Q4, we had four new NPAs over $5 million and just over $15 million, all COVID-related. Three of these customers are in Michigan with the COVID restrictions had impacted their ability to reopen. As we signaled, we also saw an increase in NPAs from our business banking portfolio. These credits were granular with only some exposures over $1 million. Despite this, total NPAs were reduced from the third quarter by $39 million or 6% and down from the second quarter peak by $150 million or 21%.  Slide 14 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we provided to our commercial and consumer customers. As we forecasted on our third quarter call, the commercial deferrals have dropped significantly and now total just $151 million, down from $942 million at Q3, and 4% billion at Q2. We expect to have limited commercial deferral balances beyond SBA going forward.  Commercial delinquencies are very modest at just 15 basis points. Our consumer deferrals have largely run their courses well, down to just $66 million as of December with post deferral performance in line with our expectations across all the portfolio segments. Our deferrals in auto, RV/Marine and home equity have nearly all lapsed and we are managing these portfolios consistent with our pre-pandemic strategies. We expect the remaining mortgage deferrals will continue to work their way down to a de minimis level over the next quarter. Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance overall was solid, net charge-offs represented an annualized 55 basis points of average loans and leases. I'm pleased to report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over $340 million or 11% in Q4, which is on top of the $425 million or 12% reduction we saw in the third quarter. Our active portfolio management process enabled us to identify potential problems early. Working with our customers, we continue to proactively remedy a number of these loans. I would also add, our nonperforming asset ratio decreased 5 basis points linked quarter to 69 basis points. Our second consecutive quarterly decline in NPAs. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. Let me turn it back over to Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Rich. Before we get to expectations, I want to spend a minute on our ongoing technology investments and progress on digital engagement. Looking at slide 16 and 17, you can a few select illustrations of our continued progress on digital capabilities. In 2020, for example, we significantly expanded our new product origination capabilities to mortgage, home equity, business checking and savings and small business lending. You can also see continued growth in digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking. As we've noted, we're investing in clearly defined digital development roadmaps across all our major business lines that will help us drive momentum, delivering differentiated products and features that will drive new customer acquisition, relationship deepening with existing customers and servicing efficiencies, both internally and for our customers. Finally, before we get to your questions, let's discuss Huntington\u2019s expectations for the full year 2021 on a stand-alone basis excluding TCF as shown on Slide 18.  Looking at the average balance sheet for the full-year 2021, we expect average loans to increase between 2% and 4% reflecting modestly higher commercial loans inclusive of PPP and mid single-digit growth in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see mid-single-digit growth in both categories. As the economy -- economic recovery progresses we expect continued acceleration of loan growth over the course of the year. With respect to deposits, we expect average balance sheet growth of 5% to 7% due to the elevated levels of commercial and consumer core deposits, which we expect to persist for several more quarters. Compared to the fourth quarter average balances, we expect modest deposit growth, primarily among consumers during the first half of the year before stabilizing in the second half. We expect to post full-year total revenue growth of approximately 1% to 3% and full-year total expense growth of 3% to 5%. With respect to revenues, we expect net interest income to be flat to modestly higher, driven by average earning asset growth and a relatively stable NIM compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 level. This guidance assumes the positive impact from the acceleration of PPP fees in the first half of the year before settling back down in the second half.  However, non-interest income is expected to be flat to modestly lower due to the challenging mortgage banking comparisons, partially offset by continued growth in capital markets, cards and payments and our wealth and investment management business lines. The current economic outlook presents compelling opportunities to invest in our businesses to meaningfully gain share and accelerate growth over the moderate term and we intend to capitalize on that. Expense growth in 2021 is expected to be driven by our ongoing strategic investments in digital and technology development, marketing and select personnel adds directly related to our strategic initiatives. The remaining underlying run rate of non-investment expenses is essentially flat.  The investments we're making are heavily front-end loaded, resulting in notably higher year-over-year expense growth rates in the first half of the year. While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term, our commitment around positive operating leverage remains over the long term. Our expectation is to bring the expense run rate to a level that is lower than the growth rate of revenue during the second half of 2021. Finally, our credit remains fundamentally sound. We expect full-year 2021 net charge-offs to be around the middle of our average through the cycle target range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points, with potential for some moderate quarterly volatility. Reserve releases remain dependent upon economic recovery and related credit performance. As a reminder, all expectations are stand-alone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the recently announced acquisition of TCF. Now, let me turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark Muth : Thanks, Zach. Melissa, we will now take questions. We  each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zerbe : Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe : I was hoping you could provide just a little more information around the inputs to, in terms of your allowance calculation. And the reason I ask that, I think, both banks this quarter have seen significant improvement in their ACL, call it, near zero or certainly negative provision expense. And then, from what they tell us, they are also been quite conservative in terms of some of their assumptions around economic improvement.  We just want to try to understand, I mean to the extent possible, like, how you are thinking about your allowance differently than what they are and kind of why your provision expense is certainly much higher than sort of the trend that we\u2019ve been seeing across the bank\u2019s base this quarter? Thank you. Steve Steinour : Yes. Sure. Ken, this is Steve. I\u2019ll update that. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we use the November base case as the kind of the driver. But we use multiple scenarios and I think if you look at these base case assumptions, the November base case assumptions, going back to 12/31 where we snapped the chalk here, a number of them were in doubt and some of them are still in doubt today as it relates to the \u2013 on the stimulus, the COVID assumptions that are built into that.  And so, as we look at not only with the economic forecast we are saying, but some of those more qualitative and subjective assessments that we make as part of our process most COVID-related. We didn\u2019t feel that there is enough certainty in those forecast to rely solely on those.  And so, there was a fair amount of qualitative judgment that we\u2019ve put into the process like we do every quarter to land the 220. The stimulus is still up in the air. All those other types of things we just thought it was premature to have a significant release.  Keep in mind too that we also have loan growth in the fourth quarter. So, about $10 million of our provision expense was driven by loan growth. Ken Zerbe : All right. That\u2019s helpful. So just a slightly related, unrelated question. So People's United yesterday announced that they are exiting their in-store branches as their relationship they have with Stop & Shop.  And on the call, they actually made kind of a compelling case for why its door branches kind of just don\u2019t make a lot of sense anymore. I know you guys have long-term contracts with Giant Eagle, et cetera. But what is \u2013 if you did have those contracts, would it still make sense to have the in-store branches? Does that value proposition still work? Steve Steinour : Ken, this is Steve. We\u2019ve been loved served by the in-store branches in the past and you\u2019ll remember we went into those almost a decade. But last week, we announced \u2013 last week we filed our Federal Reserve and OCC applications, so it\u2019s Monday, a week ago. And in those apps, we announced the consolidation of branches and we have a very large in-store partnership with Myer and Giant Eagle. But as a result of the consolidation \u2013 the combination with first \u2013 with TCF in Michigan, we\u2019ve been in a position where we are going to be consolidating 198 branches. So very substantially in Michigan. And that will allow us to cycle out of the in-store which we\u2019ve explained to the company. Just excess distribution in Michigan as a consequence of the combination. So, we are adjusting that partnership. There are other things we will look forward to doing with that and so, a few ideas on the drawing board as well.  With Giant Eagle, we have consolidated a number of branches over the last year. And there is the potential to further consolidate around in-store to traditional as we go forward. We do think that we could all served by the nation, the economics around the in-store branches.  But there is plenty enough distribution as we move forward. And as we\u2019ve seen them last year with the pandemic, more and more home goods delivered including groceries. And so, store traffic, volumes were up and revenues were up. Traffic is down and preference for doing banking activities in the in-stores is changing a bit.  Now, having said that, we see very, very strong performance in the TCF in-stores, which are in even denser metropolitan areas than we have with our two partners. So we are \u2013 we like the \u2013 we are committed to going forward to Giant Eagle for the next several years. And then we\u2019ll assess the TCF partners as we go forward. But again, they are roughly 2.5, 3 times the average size of Huntington store branches. They\u2019ve been having a very long time. They have \u2013 there further along with us. Ken Zerbe : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : Morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, John. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. John Pancari : On your net interest margin outlook, I appreciate the color you gave for relative stability for the full year margin versus 2020. Could you help us little bit with how to think about the margin over the next couple quarters here, particularly in the next quarter, just in terms of the trajectory, given the liquidity levels? How should we think about that? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Hi, this is Zach. I\u2019ll take that question. Look, I think that the margin outlook is to be relatively stable here over the next several quarters and through the course of 2021, I do expect some calenderization whereby the first half of the year will be moderately higher than the second half given PPP loan acceleration expected from the first round of PPP or second by the way about 85% of those PPP loans from round one to be forgiven approximately half and half between Q1 and Q2. And so, that will drive some incremental net interest margin in the first couple of quarters. But generally, relatively flat over the period. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks, Zach. That helps. And then, separately, also on the margin, I know you mentioned the efforts to support the stability of the margin. On the securities side and on the CET, can you give us a bit of color around what you are putting money into what types of securities and what types of yields you are seeing? And then, separately, you also mentioned that you are emphasizing growth in higher yielding asset classes. What loan areas would you flag from that perspective? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question. I\u2019ll take that again. This is Zach. So, in Q4, I\u2019ve mentioned in my script, we brought the stressed portfolio back up to Q1 levels from endpoint-to-endpoint, Q3 to Q4 to give you a sense was about $2 billion of additional securities on a net basis. And the average yield we were getting on that was 125, to give you a sense.  Portfolio was running at 187. So, but still pretty solid yield. And the mix pretty similar to what we have invested in the past, mainly mortgage-backed. As we go into 2021, one important thing that I also said in my prepared remarks that I would highlight now is that we are intending to invest an additional $2 billion, mostly in the first quarter to bring the overall securities portfolio up to $24 billion as a result of discontinuing to monitor and wash the excess liquidity levels unlike the balance sheet.  Likewise, those purchases are expected to be in the mortgage-backed securities structures, most notably with a range of yields that we are forecasting sort of between 120, 130. So pretty similar. As we go forward, we are watching pretty closely a new round of stimulus and certainly the latest round of PPP, which could cause us to increase that goal. Over time, we\u2019ll have to see where those ends. But that\u2019s kind of where we are running with those.  I\u2019ll pause for a second and then move on to the other elements \u2013 other aspects of your question you asked in terms what assets we are looking at. Just think it\u2019s back on our balance sheet optimization program. We are very positive in it. We are already starting to see the traction of an in-split.  About half and half from funding optimization and the asset growth mix optimization and when you think about the asset growth, mix optimization is really focused on higher yielding products like small business administration, production where whereas you know the nation\u2019s leading producer. And also commercial categories like equipment finance, asset-based lending, those are really the biggest focus areas that I would call out for you as a headline. John Pancari : Great. Thanks, Zach. Zach Wasserman : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hey. Well, some of you might walk through the \u2013 sort of the tweak through net charge-off guidance from last month. I mean, it certainly seems clear that credit concerns are kind of melting away for the industry. But, just sort of over the past six weeks, what in your mind has changed to take you from sort of the upper half of the \u2013 through the cycle range to sort of lowering that band as well? Rich Pohle : Yes. It\u2019s Rich. I\u2019ll be happy to take that. There is a few things. Why don\u2019t we just have more visibility on the post-deferral experience that we\u2019ve seen on both our consumer and commercial customers and as those deferrals are winding down, there is really no lagging credit impact that we saw there. The other piece of it is just continued strength in weak oil and gas sector.  We had a lot of charge-off activity in 2020. We do not expect to see charge-offs of that magnitude \u2013 certainly of that magnitude and in 2021, so we brought that forecast down a little bit. But generally, we are seeing some decent traction with our commercial customers and the consumer continues to perform very well. So those were the nature. We tweaked the guidance. I think it\u2019s the right way to say and we didn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a wholesale change. But we do feel better about the portfolio heading into 2021. Steve Steinour : Rich, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll add to that Scott. Year end delinquency is better than a year ago, pre-COVID on the commercial side the multiple quarters now of lower NPAs, lower quit class, the economic outlook. There are combination of factors and I think the oil and gas component of our charge-offs last year were mid-teens, like 16, 17 BPS, basis points or BPS.  So, that\u2019s eliminated. We don\u2019t expect to have oil and gas charge-offs. And then the high risk industries continued to look good. We obviously spend a lot of time on those every quarter. So, at various times during the quarter, especially as we get to quarter end, there is a lot of deeper review that\u2019s triggered and it frankly looks good. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that. And then, the final question was, Zach, you talked a couple of times about optimization of wholesale funding. Just to characterize as you look through the course of the year, maybe some color on the kind of opportunities or options you have there? Zach Wasserman : I think it will be kind of more of the same of what we\u2019ve talked about before, which is leveraging the really strong liquidity and deposit gathering we\u2019ve got to reduce over time the overall wholesale and corporate debt levels. And you saw us distinguish $500 million of debt in our tender that we did in Q4. I think just kind of the opportunity to continue to leverage more core deposits just to fund the company frankly over the course of this year.  This question of elevated liquidity, how long it will stay is, just sort of $64,000 question. But we are fairly convinced it\u2019s going to stay for a while and it will likely go up frankly in the near term given some of the new things that are coming through. So there is a real opportunity there.  And behind the scenes, our accounts acquisitions are deepening and deposit gathering on the core basis is accelerating as well. So, I think as we get it through this year, that would just continue to be an opportunity well out into 2022 and beyond. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys very much. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey. Good morning everybody. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Steve. Zach Wasserman : Morning. Steven Alexopoulos : I want to start on the expense side, looking at the 3% to 5% guidance for 2021, it\u2019s a bit above 2020. Steve, you said you plan to lean in and position the company better for an economic recovery. Can you give more color, just on invest in more people, systems, customer-friendly products. Can you give us some sense of what you are investing in here? Zach Wasserman : Absolutely. I mentioned in my prepared remarks - this is Zach, as I mentioned in my remarks and I want to stretch again essentially the entirety of that growth is driven by our investments and our strategic plan and if you think about this three broad categories, it\u2019s approximately 60% technology developments, around 20% marketing, and around 20% select personnel that are tied to our strategic growth initiatives. So it really is all about investment. In the tech side, we are just continuing to lean in on digital and as I mentioned in my remarks, digital development roadmaps cross every one of our business \u2013 major business lines to drive product origination, account deepening and sort of ease of use and sort of I think efficiencies and personalization and optimization across each product lines.  So we\u2019re incredibly bullish about that. The investments themselves, the expenses are front-end loaded during the year. So we\u2019ll see substantially higher levels of growth in the first half of the year and then ramping down pretty significantly in the back half of the year such that by the kind of runrate expense growth will be lower than the growth rate of revenue in the second half. But I\u2019d just summarize, what we feel it now is exactly the right time to make these investments and we are already starting to see some of the returns from them. So, we feel good about it and the trajectory and composition of it. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. For my follow-up question, so your commentary on loan pipelines and customer sentiment is favorable, but my question is, given this enormous build up of deposits, right, the whole industry is seeing, when you look at your middle market customers, are they sitting on a ton of cash, which might delay their appetite to actually draw on lines? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : It\u2019s almost a tale of two worlds, let\u2019s see. In that regard, we have many customers that are very liquid. You see it in the commercial line utilizations with us and the industry as a whole. There are some \u2013 however there are significantly investing to rebuild the inventory were frankly has not had the fundamental performance.  For whatever reasons it could be COVID-related. They just didn\u2019t have a good year. I do think the stimulus will \u2013 that has been provided, plus the proposal on it is enacted will further delay sort of the rebound to the norm in terms of line utilizations. But that will be a big tailwind for us and others eventually.  We do see supply chain disruption also impacting utilization. It\u2019s very clear happening in the dealer who will transact. For example, notwithstanding it, it improved a bit in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s not where it\u2019s not normalized and it will probably be several quarters from where it becomes normalized.  So all of that is to say that, if there is a tailwind building for the industry and we may see it in the second half of this year which is I think consistent with how many banks are stressing both GDP growth and optimism, as well as the potential for utilization. There is a lot of investment activity that\u2019s going on. They are using their cash, but at some point that will revert to a more traditional level of external financing, debt financing, as well. So, we are moving market share a bit with the growth that we are achieving through the fourth quarter and projecting and we are optimistic given the pipelines will continue to do that. But at some point, we\u2019ll have substantial tailwinds as well. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. And your plans to lean in on the investments pretty heavy early in the year and capture more of that in the back half. Zach Wasserman : It is and it\u2019s excess, particularly on the digital side, and if you think about how consumers and businesses are being trained via Apple or Amazon in terms of digital usage availability, ease capacity to accelerate transactional activity, all of that is going to impact our industry. And therefore, we\u2019ve accelerated our existing digital plans substantially to try and continue to get, stay in front, get in front and maintain that J.D. Power leading position that we\u2019ve had for a couple of years. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Terrific. I appreciate all the color. Zach Wasserman : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Morning. A follow-up question on the net interest income guide. Appreciate the color on reallocating $2 billion of cash in the first quarter. As we think about average deposits up 5% to 7% against loans up 2% to 4%, Zach, I am wondering what you are assuming for liquidity build in your outlook for net interest income flat for the rest of the year? And are you contemplating any growth from PPP 2.0, as well as forgiveness incomes from PPP 2.0 in your guide? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Thanks, Erika. Good question. I mentioned in my previous comments that it\u2019s the new sort of the $64,000 question frankly in terms of how long elevated deposits will allow. But generally what we are expecting is a relatively flat trend in our deposits at the Fed for the first half of the year, to give you a sense in Q4, it was around $5 billion and we expect to sort of retain that rough level through the first half of the year.  And then, kind of absent the new stimulus, and absent the new PPP, our operating outlook have been sort of a gradual reduction in that towards the back half of the year. But not that substantial, maybe down to $3 billion by the end of the year in terms of billion. I think, with that being said, we\u2019ll see a new stimulus of coming through on the fiscal side and likely if that does happen, we\u2019ll see that\u2019d be elevated even more and it could \u2013 as I mentioned, give an opportunity to invest more in securities.  And likewise, PPP, the next round of PPP is just now kicking off. We are not sure exactly where it\u2019s going to land. We\u2019ll see. For my guidance, I\u2019ve assumed around $1 billion. But I am hopeful and it\u2019s quite likely that we are potentially up to double that, we\u2019ll see.  In terms of the PPP forgiveness of the first round, I think I mentioned, and pretty hard that we\u2019ll just restated for clarity, we are assuming 85% of the $6 billion that we have on sheet in Q4 to be forgiven in the first half of the year. Erika Najarian : Got it. I\u2019ll follow-up on the modeling call on the forgiveness or PPP 2.0. The \u2013 my second question is more for Steve, the 35 to 55 basis points is quite an accomplishment for the kind of economic downturn we have experienced.  And I am wondering, do you think that the government has been successful at redefining what the cycle peak is for this downturn and that the 35 to 55 basis points represent the peak and losses that we\u2019ll see during the cycle or do you think just delayed it to 2022? Steve Steinour : Erika, I don\u2019t believe the losses are materially delayed in our case. I can\u2019t answer for other institutions. But it seems to me that the proactive efforts by the Federal Reserve and be it fiscal - multiple rounds of fiscal stimulus, then substantial losses have been likely avoided as support has been delivered to consumers and small business and the interest rate levels at historic lows have helped businesses generally.  So, I think, yes, we will show very strong actions mitigated what otherwise could have been a ugly period in our economic history. If we think back to the second quarter and the free fall in GDP to be able to have substantially reverse that in just a couple of quarters that\u2019s remarkable unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in our history.  And I think that flows then through the system with lower losses over time. I think we\u2019ve been conservative, maybe very conservative in our loss recognition thus far. But we\u2019ve tried to maintain that to the posture as you saw with how we approach provision in the fourth quarter just to let this season and get to a high level of confidence before we do things with the lowering reserves and some of our things like that. But I am very optimistic and confident that we have our losses peaked in 2020. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And Mark is going to kill me, but I have to squeeze in this third question and Steve this is for you. If you like the \u2013 this is more a testing of a thesis, but expense is up 3% to 5%. It seems like you are very much looking forward and saying, look, this is a year where we may likely have significant reserve release if the economic outlook pans out.  And the street is not going to give us much credit for that earnings anyway, why not pull forward the expenses and have a great first full year in 2022 for both as a standalone company and as a combined company? Any thoughts there? Steve Steinour : Well, that is not the intended approach. We have to call the reserves as we\u2019ve seen. We have multiple economic scenarios in a peak second round \u2013 I hope a peak second round of virus as of yearend. That is a possible scenario, but that\u2019s not a planned scenario. Revert to what Zach said a minute ago, the court census are virtually flat in 2021 versus 2020, the increases are discretionary investment decisions made as a consequence of the strategic planning of the posture we want to take principally around our digital technology. So, we believe we have a momentum in the business.  We were one of the few banks that talked about commercial loan growth and our pipeline year-over-year is better in a COVID environment \u2013 that was in a pre-COVID environment. So, like what we\u2019ve been able to build operating the company through this very challenging period of time in terms of momentum and focus and execution and we are going to continue to play that against the backdrop of consumer and business demands changing radically as a consequence of digital and the need for digital throughout the pandemic.  And again, I think usage is being defined by others by Amazon and Apple and others. And so, those expectations are, I believe that the reality for our industry and certainly our company and we are going to invest to meet those, in fact get ahead of them. Erika Najarian : Got it. It makes sense to me. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Well, thanks. Hey, good morning, everyone. One follow-up on the NIII side, Zach. Just wondering if you can parse it. Just \u2013 if you just think about the all-in PPP 2020 that was in the NII versus 2021, vis-\u00e0-vis, how you are talking about overall NII for the year, is there a way you could help us understand that? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. I think, looking by notes here, maybe we can follow more on the online call too. Look, think about four basis points of benefit on a full year basis in the NIM from the PPP program in 2021, to give you a sense. Ken Usdin : And what was that in 2020? Zach Wasserman : One basis point. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. So, a little bit higher, it makes sense. Okay. And then the second question is on the consumer loan side, you are talking about - really good growth there again, mid-single-digit growth. But auto has been flat for several quarters now. You\u2019ve grown some of the other categories. Just wondering specifically the auto, just how you are feeling about growing that book going ahead and then, if that\u2019s expected to stay flat, where would you expect to see the rest of the growth coming from on the consumer side? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : The auto industry was \u2013 like a $16 million, $16.2 million production in 2020 and the outlook is close to the $17 million going forward for 2021. So that would be part of it. There is also a market share component that will be \u2013 I think, just because of our consistency and track record, it will continue to move and you have to maintain the spreads that we are looking for as well as credit quality.  We are also opening up or planning to open up in a few additional states in 2021 that will also supplement our production. So, we are confident and our team has been outstanding in this area for many, many years. We are confident in our ability to execute that. But we also \u2013 I think we are number five or six nationally in terms of home equity originations.  So that\u2019s just mortgage. So, we are not dependent wholly on mortgage refis. We have a lot of broad based home lending capabilities and investments in technology is a area as well which will continue to drive more volume. We have a substantial application of blend for example, well that has been ramped up very quickly and will be an important \u2013 a very important add for us as we go forward. I think we\u2019ve taken about ten days off at the close as a result of using that as an example. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter Winter : Good morning. I was wondering, you gave \u2013 morning. You gave some guidance that mortgage banking is going to be challenging, which is good for all banks. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color how you are thinking about mortgage banking off the fourth quarter level. You can give a little bit of guidance. Zach Wasserman : Absolutely. This is Zach. I\u2019ll take that one. So, mortgage banking, we said coming off and it\u2019s just an incredible year in 2020. To give you a sense, the industry, mortgage banking association is forecasting volumes in 2020 down about 23% with the shift toward purchase not surprisingly with refis being very substantially lower.  We are not giving gaining share on add volumes over the last couple of years and we expect to continue to do so. So it\u2019s our general expectation for at volume is sort of down in the 10% to 15% range relative to that 20% or more down as an industry level. I think one of the things we are watching pretty closely is also the saleable trend and where that trend is.  We frankly budgeted pretty conservatively on that assuming a relatively continual trend back to more historical levels by the end of the year. We will see, so far they are actually holding up some fairly solid in the first days of Q1 and we\u2019ll see that those are \u2013 as you know. But generally, we\u2019ve budgeted fairly conservatively. So, like mortgage banking income is going to be down year-on-year and so, as I mentioned, really bringing into the other fee income lines that are very smartly to this after. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks. And if could ask about the TCF acquisition, I am just wondering, obviously, you haven\u2019t closed the deal. But any way you can quantify maybe a range of potential revenue synergies? I know it\u2019s not part of your guidance and then, secondly, what would say at the top three revenue opportunities with this deal? Steve Steinour : Peter, I\u2019ll take that and let me start. I think that is a fit for us with an answer to the question I had last time. So, with apologies for that. But picking up on TCF, we haven\u2019t talked a lot about revenue synergies. But they are clearly there. We have a much broader product menu on both the consumer and business side.  So the capacity of the cross-sell and people, much like we saw with FirstMerit is very substantial. And it\u2019s hard to take that and it\u2019s certainly not something you guys want to hear. So we haven\u2019t front run that with you. But that we\u2019ve been definitely. We\u2019ve been very impressed with the quality of the teams that we\u2019ve seen in a variety of the areas in TCF, both business line and technologies on the supporting in this for example.  And so, I think we will be a stronger company by the blend, as well and that will have upside. Then finally, they do some things extraordinarily well. Their equipment finance business. Their inventory finance business, these are little gems and they are not widely known or appreciated but we really like what we saw in the diligence and have learned subsequently. And those are just a few of the businesses and opportunities.  There is a substantial outsourcing as well both on the capital market side for most products and again, it\u2019s a much more limited menu that we offer as well as their broker/dealer, their credit card and some variety of businesses that we will bring back in fairly quickly as we move forward. So, there is the 40% excess and we just articulated a 43% branch consolidation.  So you can see where that\u2019s coming from. It will be their systems on ours a 100%. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of early on very, very good work that\u2019s getting bullish on the expense side, but the play here is a revenue play. Yet new markets \u2013 exciting new markets, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Denver, Colorado Springs, more than tripling us in Chicago, opening in Milwaukee and in Soltan Valley.  I mean, there is a lot to go for plus the scale change in Michigan will be awarded to and virtually everything in Michigan. So, we really like the resident side of this and you\u2019ll see that reflected in 2022 and beyond as we get set. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. Hey guys. I have a follow-up question on auto, specifically, Slide 44, your mix of new originations increased to 54% this quarter. Can you speak to the notion that new vehicle financing is an area where the captives have a greater edge over indirect lenders, because their primary goal is helping their OEMs move steel? So, they are willing to compromise a bit more on pricing.  Does that have a \u2013 I guess, does that have your greater share of new vehicle originations. So just that you guys are getting lower margins than you would have had a larger mix of used. If you could just kind of comment on the profitability of used versus new vehicle financing that would be helpful? Steve Steinour : This is typical seasonality of new modeling adoption and so, as we look back we see essentially the same ratios year-over-year. Albeit this year, a bit constrained by just inventory. So, that, you are right. The OEMs will subvent and that\u2019s why we tend to have slightly more used than new as that\u2019s sort of a normalized runrate.  As you know, we\u2019ve been very, very disciplined for many, many years in this area. And so the performance of the book has been very consistent and would expect that to continue to be so. It's our best performing asset class year in, year out on DFAST as an example.  So we really like our positioning with the product, with the dealers. The consistency and speed at which we offer, we think we've got a best-in-class capability. It was clearly one of our most seasoned teams in the bay managing this area. And so I don't see a big change going on. There are times when the OEMs will subvent more to try and drive more volume. And history would tell us these things come in waves. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful, Steve. And I am sorry if I missed this, but wanted to follow-up on. You made a comment in your prepared remarks around dealer floor plan levels and how it will take longer for balances to return to back to historical levels. Does that presume that dealers will be running with less inventory than they have historically in sort of kind of a new normal post-COVID environment or do you think that that will see a reversion to historical inventory levels? Steve Steinour : We sent the reversion to the norm if the supply chain issue at this point. For example, you would have seen Audi\u2019s manufacturing interrupted by just a chip last week in terms of production. So this will come back, we believe probably at this point by the \u2013 in the second half, as opposed to earlier and some of the imports, and particular your feeling constrained on the supply side.  You got to see more and more manufacturing come back into the U.S. or a pick up on Mexico, Canada, as a result of wanting to narrow the supply chain lines as a consequence of what\u2019s happened over the last year. And that\u2019s a benefit to us. Bill Carcache : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks. Good morning guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks for let me come in here at the end of the queue. But couple of clean ups. RV Marine, you had some pretty strong growth and maybe some of that is COVID-related last year. Do you expect a mean reversion there? What are you thinking about in terms of growth potential there and just longer term thinking about asset values there? Steve Steinour : The industry outlook on that, Jon, is for continued high purchase levels for the next couple of years. And we are positioned for that very, very well. As you know, that\u2019s an 800 FICO for us. So, we worried a bit about oversupply in the intermediate term, but the positioning of our book, I think will very, very substantially mitigate what could be in three to five years of the next asset. So I think we are playing it very, very well and we\u2019ll have consistency of performance with 800 plus average FICOs for the foreseeable future and I think that\u2019s what you are getting to this supply/demand potential imbalances. We come back out of COVID, but that could exist right now there is virtually a very little on marine lots as of the end of the third quarter building again.  But demand could outstrip supply as it did in 2020. And to a certain extent they have it with RV as well. So, I think there is a very good couple of years and where we are playing, I believe is very safe for the long-term and possible. Jon Arfstrom : And Rich, a question for you. Your guidance is great, but the one thing we are all trying to plug in is the provision and reserve levels. And so, I wanted to go back one more time to this. You use the term snap a chalk line in December which I think I never heard on a call before. But it\u2019s excellent. You talked about using the November base case. You look at December and January, at least if you use Moody\u2019s it\u2019s clearly better.  You talked about you are qualitative, you are waiting for stimulus, that\u2019s a little bit uncertain. Is it as simple as if we get the stimulus and this January Moody\u2019s holds, we get some improvement in February. The reserves just have to come down. Don\u2019t think is that\u2019s the right way to look at it. Rich Pohle : Yes. I would say, absolutely the reserves have to come down. It\u2019s just a question of the timing and where they come down to. We started, the seasonal day one was a 170 and we are up to 229. That I would imagine at some point, we are going to get back to the neighborhood of the 170 where we started. But I would say that we are also not targeting a specific time to get there.  I think as I pointed out, we are going to be prudent on \u2013 we were conservative on the way up and we will be prudent on the way down to make sure that we are not kind of whipsawing the provision on a quarter-by-quarter basis overreacting to one data point.  Along the way, I think it\u2019s we sit here and run a very disciplined process every quarter looking at another wind of quantitative pieces of it. But the more qualitative pieces and when we feel that those are aligning and our credit quality continues to hold, which we expect that that will, we\u2019ll bring the reserve down. And I would say that that is more likely to happen in the back half of the year and first quarter certainly. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Good. Thanks a lot. Okay. Good. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Steinour for any final comments. Steve Steinour : Thank you for the questions and your interest in Huntington. Certainly proud of our colleagues and the 2020 performance in light of the most challenging operating environment I faced in my career. But I hope we\u2019ve conveyed to you how excited we are about the opportunities we see ahead in 2021 and beyond. So we are entering 2021 from a position of strength.  We had momentum. The disciplined execution of our strategies, coupled with the pending acquisition sets us to capitalize on emerging opportunities to innovate, to gain share, to reposition the company for growth for years to come, all while continuing to deliver top quartile financial performance. We approach this with a strong foundation of enterprise risk management as you know including the deeply embedded stock ownership mentality, which aligns our Board, management and colleagues. So, again, thank you for your support and interest. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thank you, Daryl. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer will join us for the Q&A session. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to the slides and the material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark. Good morning, everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the leading people-first digitally powered bank in the nation. We continue to execute against this strategic vision and are pleased with our progress to-date. We see significant opportunities ahead of us, as we position our businesses for the recovery at hand. Over the past year, we updated our multi-year strategic plan with a focus on driving long-term revenue growth, continuing to build our brand based on best-in-class products and increasing our industry-leading customer satisfaction across our businesses. We also announced the planned acquisition of TCF Financial, which will provide powerful opportunities to grow revenue, expand our market presence and provide scale to our businesses while increasing our investments in digital and other areas. This combination will increase our capacity to invest and we will become more efficient with the significant expected expense takeouts. We accelerated our digital investments as part of our strategic vision and are encouraged by the digital adoption trends. Due to the investments we've already made, for the first time over half of new customer deposit accounts were originated digitally in the last quarter. The double-digit growth in active digital and mobile engagement is similarly encouraging. As we look ahead, we're optimistic about a strong economic recovery. Unemployment has decreased significantly across our footprint. We\u2019re again, hearing a crescendo of commentary from our customers regarding labor constraints and wage inflation. Consumer confidence has meaningfully improved. On average, consumers are less leveraged and more liquid. Our debit card trends have consistently posted double-digit year-over-year growth rates for the past several quarters. Consumer spending in service industries is expected to broadly accelerate this year as demand returns. Consumer loan production also continues to be strong. On the commercial side, sentiment is encouraging. Our pipelines are up across the board, increasing our confidence in recovery of commercial loan demand later this year. While supply chain constraints such as the semiconductor shortages will likely challenge some manufacturers in the near-term, progress of the recovery and visibility into growing customer orders are causing outlooks to strengthen. Let me also share some high level remarks from our first quarter results, which provided a strong start to the year and included solid core performance with our momentum building. Commercial loan originations were in line with expectations. However, overall growth was constrained by both forgiveness of PPP loans and continued headwinds in dealer floorplan and commercial line utilization. Both of which are temporary challenges. Residential mortgage, auto and RV/Marine produced seasonally strong originations in face of tight inventory. Growth in consumer loan balances was obscured by unprecedented levels of paydowns following the two recent rounds of stimulus. Deposit growth continues to consistently exceed expectations. Finally, on Slide 4, I'd like to give an update on the pending TCF acquisition. We believe the timing could not be better as the strengthening recovery dovetails with the growth and scale opportunities presented by this combination. We continue to make good progress toward our anticipated closing late in the second quarter, and to complete the majority of systems conversions late in the third quarter. In March, Huntington and TCF shareholders approved the transaction and our integration plan is on track. We completed the selection of key management and anticipate receiving the outstanding regulatory approvals, including the required branch divestiture in the coming weeks. We've become major components of the cost reduction plan including the closure of 44 Meijer branches later this quarter. Now let me turn it over to Zach for more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the first quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.48. Return on average assets was 1.76% and return on average tangible common equity was 23.7%. Bottom line results were augmented by two notable items. The first was a $144 million mark-to-market benefit on our interest rate caps, driven by the steepening yield curve and increased market volatility. The second was $125 million or 7% reserve release, resulting from the improving economic outlook and credit metrics. Partially offsetting these were $21 million of TCF acquisition-related expenses, which are broken out as a significant item in the earnings release with granularity provided in Table 8. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our results in more detail. We continue to be pleased with our sustained growth of pre-tax pre-provision earnings, which increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. Total revenue increased 19% versus the year ago quarter. Net interest income grew 23% driven by solid underlying loan growth and a 34 basis point increase in NIM, which were positively impacted by the substantial mark-to-market gain that I mentioned in our interest rate cap derivatives and the $44 million of accelerated PPP loan fee accretion. Fee income growth of 9% was aided by a record first quarter for mortgage banking income, as saleable mortgage originations set its own record with 89% year-over-year growth and secondary marketing spreads remained elevated. Similarly, our wealth and investment management businesses experienced its best quarter ever with respect to net asset flows and also benefited from positive equity market performance over the prior 12 months. Card and payments continue to post strong, consistent growth. Deposit service charges remain below the year ago level as elevated consumer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line. Total expenses were higher by $141 million or 22% from the year ago quarter, three percentage points of this growth can be attributed to the approximately $21 million of significant items related to the TCF acquisition. There were also approximately $45 million of expenses in the quarter or approximately seven percentage points of growth resulting from the pull forward of these three expenses that otherwise would have been incurred in the future. The first of which was a $25 million contribution to the Columbus Foundation. Second, we moved our annual long-term incentive grants to March from the historical timing in May. Third, we retimed some expense related to our colleagues\u2019 health savings accounts, which would otherwise have been incurred in the balance of 2021. These two compensation related items together totaled approximately $20 million. The remaining approximately 11.5% underlying expense growth rate was driven primarily by the accelerated investment in strategic growth initiatives, which we have been communicating for the past several quarters. Turning to Slide 7, FTE net interest income increased 23% as earning asset growth was coupled with year-over-year NIM expansion. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin increased 54 basis points to 3.48%, as shown in the reconciliation on the right side of the slide, the linked-quarter increased primarily reflected the 49 basis point net change in the interest rate caps. As we've discussed previously, we're taking actions on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the inherent margin pressure caused by the prolonged low interest rate environment, managing the underlying core net interest margin near current levels. Given the significant impact on NIM from the interest rate caps, Slide 8 provides additional information on this aspect of our comprehensive hedging strategy. As we disclosed in December, we purchased $5 billion of interest rate caps with an average tenor of seven years, to reduce impacts on capital from rising rates. This hedging action performed very well this quarter. In March, we subsequently sold $3 billion of new interest rate caps at a higher strike price to create a collar like position. This is expected to dampen further mark-to-market impacts and recovered approximately half of the premium paid on the initial caps, while maintaining the majority of the capital protection from the physician. Turning to Slide 9. Average earning assets increased $12 billion or 12% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the $6 billion of PPP loans and the $5 billion increase in deposits of the Fed. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 11% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. On a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans decreased 1%, primarily reflecting the forgiveness of PPP loans and the decline in dealer floorplan utilization. As we indicated at the RBC conference in March, commercial loan pipelines remain up significantly from a year ago, and we're seeing that manifest in new commercial loan production. Residential mortgage, RV and marine, all posted year-over-year growth in new production. Average consumer loan balances declined sequentially as stimulus-related paydowns more than offset strong new production in the quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, average earning asset growth primarily reflected the $2 billion or 9% increase in average securities as we executed our previous announced plan to deploy excess liquidity through the purchase of securities during the quarter. Turning to Slide 10. We will review deposit growth and funding. Average core deposits increased 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by increased consumer liquidity levels related to the downturn, consumer growth largely related to stimulus, increased account production and reduced attrition. Slide 11 provides an update on PPP forgiveness and expectations for the current program. In total, Huntington approved $6.6 billion of PPP loans in the original program and has approved an additional $1.8 billion of loans in the current program. In light of the recent congressional extension of the program, and our current application activity, we now anticipate the total amount for the current round to reach approximately $2 billion. We continue to expect approximately 85% of those balances from the original program and the new program ultimately to be forgiven. Through the end of March, $2.4 billion of loans from the original tranche have been forgiven, and we anticipate approximately $2.3 billion will be forgiven during the second quarter. For the current program, we expect the majority of the forgiveness to occur this year, particularly in the second half of the year. Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, ended the quarter at 7.11%, down five basis points sequentially. The common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1 ended up the quarter at 10.33%, up 33 basis points from the last quarter. The CET1 ratio was modestly above our 9% to 10% operating guideline, and we feel it's prudent to maintain strong capital levels going into the TCF acquisition. It also positions us well to execute on our growth initiatives and investment opportunities going forward. As we have previously communicated, we've paused share repurchases until we have substantially completed the TCF acquisition and integration. Slide 13 provides a lock of our allowance for credit losses. The first quarter included a $125 million reserve release, primarily from consumer, while the quarter in ACL represents 2.17% loans and 2.33% of loans, excluding PPP. We believe this is a prudent level to address remaining economic uncertainty while reflecting the improved overall credit metrics and economic outlook. Slide 14 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our overall credit performance continued to strengthen. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 32 basis points of average loans and leases, slightly below the low end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our criticized asset and NPA ratios were both relatively stable. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. I want to spend a minute on our ongoing investments and progress on digital engagement and origination. Looking at Slide 15, we continue to invest in a focused set of strategic initiatives to drive revenue acceleration and competitive differentiation. In addition to a variety of digital and product investments, we are adding personnel and core revenue-generating roles to support strategic growth in our capital markets, specialty banking, small business administration and vehicle finance businesses. We have also increased marketing expense back to prepandemic levels and to promote new launches related to fair play banking. Slide 16 illustrates several key digital engagement and origination trends. Showing some of the benefits of our ongoing tech investments. On the left side of the slide, you can see continued growth in monthly digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking. The digital origination trends on the right side of the slide are particularly encouraging as they show strong customer uptake of the new consumer and business digital origination capabilities we introduced over the course of the last year. We are executing robust technology road maps across our business lines that will drive sustainable revenue momentum via improved customer acquisition, retention and deepening. Finally, Slide 17 provides our updated expectations for the full year 2021 on a Huntington stand-alone basis. We now expect full year average loan growth of 1% to 3%, down slightly from prior expectations as a result of the elevated levels of paydowns and a delayed recovery of commercial and vehicle floorplan line utilization. These expectations reflect flat to modestly higher commercial loans inclusive of PPP and low single-digit growth in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see low single-digit growth in both. For deposits, we now expect full year average balance growth of 9% to 11%, higher than previous expectations given the stronger-than-anticipated deposit inflows in the first quarter and the overall elevated levels of core deposits, which we expect to persist for several more quarters. We are also adjusting our expectations for full year total revenue growth higher to a range of 3.3% to 5%. We expect net interest income growth to be in the mid-single digits, while noninterest income is expected to be modestly lower for the full year. Full year growth expectations for noninterest expense are now between 7% and 9%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding $21 million of significant items I discussed previously, we expect noninterest expense to increase between 6% and 8%. This increase, relative to our prior expectations, is driven by the foundation donation in the first quarter and increases in compensation expenses related to the higher revenue expectation for the year. The large majority of the underlying expense growth continues to be driven by investments in our strategic growth initiatives as we've discussed previously. While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near-term, our commitment to positive operating leverage remains over the long-term. Our expectation and plan is to bring the expense growth rate back to more normalized levels during the second half of 2021. Finally, credit remains fundamentally sound. We now expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to be between 30 to 40 basis points, reflecting improving economic conditions and stable charge-offs in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Further reserve releases remain dependent on the economic recovery and related credit performance. As a reminder, all expectations are stand-alone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the pending acquisition of TCF. Now let me turn it back to Mark, so we can get your questions. Mark Muth : Thank you, Zack. Daryl, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Zerbe : All right, great, thank you. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe : Why don't we start \u2013 just in terms of the interest rate caps, I probably may not be the only one who didn't appreciate how meaningful this could be on a mark-to-market basis for our NII. I get that you added the short cap position, but it still seems that you are sort of \u2013 you have a fair amount of long exposure outstanding. Can you just talk about the volatility that we should expect sort of on how long does this volatility last over time? And I mean, is it right to assume that we could be looking at maybe not $100-plus million swings, but $50 million, $60 million swings in NII in any given quarter, up or down? Zach Wasserman : Hi Ken, this is Zach. I'll take that question. And look, I would start by saying the priority of our \u2013 the goal for this position and our strategy here was to look around the corner to manage risk to protect capital and to be dynamic and proactive to do that. And we thought it was a really smart move, and as you saw it, I think it benefited us substantially. And so that also underlies our decision to continue to maintain this position, albeit somewhat colored as we discussed for the foreseeable future. And so we'll have to see what happens. These get marked to market every day. And then, ultimately, we post the result that's extent at the very last day of the quarter. But we believe it is the right position as we go forward here. So we'll have to see. We'll keep you posted. But over the long-term, we think it's a really smart position for us to protect our capital. Steve Steinour : Ken, I'll just add, what we executed these in the fourth quarter. Remember the outlook was the rates would be flat through \u2013 well into 2023. So we thought the benefit of this capital protection would be in the out years, four, five, six plus and obviously, interest rate outlook changed very rapidly after the election. But it wasn't our intent to sort of view this as some kind of short-term position when we originated it. It was this protection of capital over time. Ken Zerbe : Got it. No, it definitely worked out incredibly well this quarter. No doubt about that. My second sort of related follow-up question. Is it a little more in the weeds. I think I'm missing something, but would love your clarification on this. If we look at just the change in net interest income from last quarter to this quarter, and we back out only the change if \u2013 the way I understand it, the change in the caps of, call it, $140 million to the positive. And then we backed out another $40 million change in PPP income, it implies that net interest income actually went down by $32 million sort of on an all else equal basis. Am I missing something in that calculation? Steve Steinour : I think you got it right. I think we saw \u2013 as we noted in the commentary, a bit of pressure on underlying loans in the quarter just from the headwinds that we're seeing in line utilization, but that was offset by really strong fee income growth during the quarter. The NIM, if you were to strip out that cap gain was $2.97 to give you a sense of the net interest margin. Zach Wasserman : And Ken, you also had the impact of day count, if you're looking at the dollars. Steve Steinour : On a sequential basis, correct. Ken Zerbe : Got it, okay. All right, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: I know you talked about it in the past here and there. But as we think about the increased investment spend this year, specifically on technology and digital. I was just wondering if you could summarize what a couple of the kind of bigger initiatives that your spend is that's driving that higher investment spend this year? Zach Wasserman : Yes. I think \u2013 this is Zach. I'll take that, and Steve may want to tack on as well here. But what we really like about our strategic plan is it's incredibly focused, and it's driven by key initiatives across each of our business lines. So within our consumer business line, which we've talked about for a while, much of the increased investment is around digital with three major focus areas as we talked about over the last several years and certainly last year, improving our digital point-of-sale and product origination capabilities. We largely completed that last year. And now the teams are working through how to best optimize and incorporate that within the omnichannel client engagement process we have for client origination. Also, a lot of focus around engagement and deepening to personalization and ease of use client account servicing. In the commercial business, significant amount of digital investment as well around new client onboarding, relationship manager digital tool sets as well as focused investment in new people, for example, in specialty banking and in our capital markets business. We're also really pleased with the investments we're putting into our wealth and investment management business, which, again is sort of a mixture of both technology to improve the client adviser interaction experience and relationship management tools as well as select people hires as we bring on new relationship managers, which is, as I mentioned in my script, really driving substantial sales growth and performance. And lastly, I would highlight vehicle finance. For the last several years, we've been working to digitize the customer experience as well as continue to expand the geographic footprint of that business in a way that's really constructive. Steve, do you want to talk about that? Matt O\u2019Connor: That's a very helpful summary. As we think half the cost saves associated with the TCF deal, you'd mentioned long-term expense growth. Like what is a good call it, three to five year outlook on expense growth? And I understand it might be somewhat revenue dependent. But if you think about most revenue growth coming from loans, NIM expansion, hopefully, things that aren't super high on the efficiency ratio, what would a good range for underlying expense growth be? Zach Wasserman : Yes. It's a great question. And I would note that for the next several years, based on our forecast for the integration of the TCF acquisition, overall reported revenue and expense growth levels will be substantially impacted by that, and you're going to see quite high levels of growth in both as we incorporate that business and measure the year-over-year growth. But kind of an underlying basis, which I know what's the basis of your question, my expectation and goal is that we're growing the top line at or above nominal GDP, with revenue lower than that and driving positive operating leverage. I think over the long-term, something like 1.5% to 3.5% sort of inflationary growth is logical. And if revenue is stronger than perhaps expenses are stronger than that. But generally, that's my broad expectation. Steve Steinour : Ken, I just want to reiterate the commitment to positive operating leverage after nine years, we've elected this year to make investments coming off the strategic plan and particularly because of the economic volatility that we saw last year with the virus and the expected recovery. We think we are playing this in terms of timing, exactly right. We've got a series of near-term revenue growth initiatives that we're executing. And that will position us for the long-term, but we will be back to positive operating leverage. Matt O\u2019Connor: Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just one follow-up on the expense side. So clearly, you have the excess revenues helped by the swaps and then a higher expected growth rate this year on the expenses, which makes sense that you're continuing to accelerate. But just, Zach, you mentioned last quarter, a different cadence between first half expense growth and second half expense growth. I just want to try to understand, is the increment that's embedded in the new expense growth rate also going to show all in the first half in part due to the items in the first? Just kind of if you can walk us through how things traject from here would be helpful. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Yes, Ken, thanks for the question. I appreciate the chance to clarify. I would say approximately three quarters of the incremental expenses were what we saw come through in Q1. So there's a small lift in the balance of the year, but most of it was what we saw come through in Q4, Q1. And the key thing with our plan is as that we're front-loading these investments into the first half of the 2021. And so the expectation is really the same as it was before, elevated expense growth on a kind of core run rate basis in the first half coming down to more normal levels in the second half of the year. And of that 6% to 8% underlying core expense, approximately five percentage points of that is our long-term strategic investments. And the other 1% to 3% is really sort of a natural expense inflation that you might expect and some normalization of company-wide programs like merit and T&E and medical costs and things of this nature and some additional expenses to support the additional revenue, as I noted in my prepared remarks. So front-end loaded, back-end back to historical levels and really no change other than those factors I just talked about. Ken Usdin : Helpful. And then the same kind of just thoughts process on the NII side. Obviously, NII outlook helped by the $144 million. Just underneath that, can you just talk about just the underlying changes to your prior views on NII versus the fees look as well? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Overall, I expect mid-single digits interest income for the full year. I think driven by \u2013 in part by our modest growth in assets that we've indicated in the guidance between 1% and 3%. And spread \u2013 NIM spread, overall, but it will be roughly flat for the full year. I think just touching on NIM for a second. Next couple of quarters will likely be in the mid 2.80s in terms of NIM, biggest impact, just changing our expectations somewhat is continued elevated levels of Fed cash driven by the elevated levels liquidity across the system that many folks have commented on here in the earnings cycle, and, to some degree, the beginning of the roll-off of our hedges, which will be down about 7 basis points into Q2. So Q2 will be a trough to mid-2.80s for the next several quarters. But pulling off, FY 2020 still looks at like a NIM of 2.90 or better and long term, still forecasting to maintain those levels and with stable to rising NIM over the longer-term. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thank you, Zach. Zach Wasserman : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Hey, just wanted to ask, I guess, a follow-up on the rate cap. So between the \u2013 what you sort of captured in the first quarter and then the sale of the $3 billion new caps in March. So does this do anything to your \u2013 sort of your forward rate sensitivity? I think, Zach, I've sort of thought about the hedges as more balance sheet protection than really adjusting your rate sensitivity. So is there any change to that dynamic? Zach Wasserman : So I think you got it right. The position was around protecting capital. And I think you saw on the slide a 52% offset of the OCI mark on securities was protected by this. So it's really good. We've got our Treasurer, Derek Meyer in the room. Why don't, Derek, you want to comment a little bit on asset sensitivity and in your outlook for that one. Derek Meyer : Yes. Thank you. So we've continued to look at that. Obviously, we've already stated this was primarily thinking of a capital play. There is the knock-on effect because it comes to earnings on our margin. Most of our decisionings has been to retain as much downside protection while capturing the upside. As these rates have gone up, and that is these caps have obviously made us even more sensitive in that respect, we are evaluating our next hedging moves to protect that downside without giving up that upside opportunity. So it does change the posture. That's also a big part of what we're thinking about as we evaluate our positioning with TCF, which is a separate set of decisions, but that is another set of levers that we have to incorporate into our forward view. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Broadly speaking, just pulling back a second, I think really like where the asset sensitivity kind of strategy and trend is going in that, over time, as our existing hedge position slowly rolls off, we will become more and more exposed to what will be likely a gradually increasing interest rate environment as well. And so think it's sort of well-timed for us to be exposed in that way as rates begin to rise over the next several years. Scott Siefers : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess as a follow-up, I think, Zach, at a point, you'd mentioned the sale of the new rig caps, the $3 billion, that should sort of dampen the mark-to-market impacts. Is there a way to sort of speak to how much protection you have against future volatility like we saw this quarter, both up and down? Zach Wasserman : Yes. It's a good question. We estimate it's between 15% and 30% impact on dampening. So importantly, we wanted to maintain kind of a net long exposure there because we do think, to the extent that there's a probability of moves substantially off the forward curve, it's likely to be higher. But that dampening is sort of between 15% and 30% as you go forward. Scott Siefers : Got it. All right, thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Winter : Good morning. I was wondering if could you talk about \u2013 you mentioned the loan pipelines are very strong. I'm just wondering, can you talk about what you're hearing from your customers about making investments and \u2013 versus kind of the appetite to draw down on lines of credit versus using that excess liquidity and maybe delaying mine drawdowns? Steve Steinour : Peter, this is Steve. So in the last four, five weeks, I've had about 50 CEOs in small meeting virtual conversations. And the outlook by them is virtually all very positive about this year, pipelines, their backlogs, very, very encouraging and their overall economic outlook for the next couple of years also very positive. They have \u2013 in a number of situations, have supply chain constraints, some of it from mundane items, some of it for chips. But there's a curtailment that, I think, is being experienced, at least in part by these companies on the supply chain. Universally, they talk about inability to get adequate labor, very high turnover and clear wage inflation at the low end. A consequence of that will be more investment by many of them into automation all the way through including packaging. So we expect there'll be a fair amount of equipment finance activity this year. And when we combine with TCF, we'll have a seventh, eighth largest equipment finance company in the country, that should position us very well. We have a very good technology finance team that will play well with automation on the factory side. But even in the health care, health care product side, we're seeing a strong uptick. The health care systems are doing better, haven't been able to reopen and sustain activity that was diminished during the peak of the virus. So we \u2013 the people we're talking to, who are the CEOs in that arena, generally very, very confident going forward. So we think the strong pipelines we're seeing, we're up about 40% of the commercial pipeline year-over-year is reflective of what will be demand as we go through the year, probably more in the second half than first, but this \u2013 in part because many of them had very good years have liquidity and they're using that liquidity as opposed to line utilizations and other things. Inventories are low in many of these companies, and some of its supply chain, but some of its significant demand, inflation on the commodity side wood or lumber, just a whole host of areas where there's cost push. And I think that will engender further borrowing as their liquidity gets soaked up. So we're \u2013 from these conversations, we're optimistic about the continuing improvement especially seen in the second half. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks, Steve. And then if I can ask just a follow-up on the PPP. You gave some pretty good disclosure on Slide 11. But what's the outlook, Zach, for the rest of the year to net interest income from PPP? Zach Wasserman : Yes. I think, as we said, the expectation is that we'll see a very substantial amount of additional forgiveness in the second quarter, and I think, to give you a sense, Q1 revenue in total from PPP was around $76 million, of which $45 million was the \u2013 have accelerated and $31 million was the underlying yield. My expectation for Q2 is around $50 million total revenue, of which basically half and half between yield and accelerated \u2013 the acceleration. And that will represent the preponderance of the PPP revenues for the first program. We'll see a little bit of a tail as we go into the balance of the year. The Round 2, I mentioned, is around $2 billion, about 85%. We think we've forgiven much of it in 2021. That will add around $1.3 billion of ADB and $60 million of revenue we estimate to the year. I know we'll have an analyst modeling call after this, and we can probably double-click into more of the details during that, but this is probably the right high-level comments for you now. Peter Winter : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Zach Wasserman : Welcome. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Bill Carcache : Thanks, good morning; Steve and Zach. Some investors have expressed concern around the risk that internal combustion engine vehicles will lose value compared to electronic vehicles as they take over and obviously, there's debate around when that's going to happen. But can you speak to how HBAN is thinking about this risk, what you guys are doing about it and the extent to which you expect to play a role in helping consumers fund Q3 repurchases as well as like from the standpoint of risk of declining collateral values for your existing book, if you could comment on that as well. Steve Steinour : So Bill, Steve. Good question, thank you. We think this is going to be an extended transition here. And I believe the industry is of that belief as well. There's \u2013 EV is building in the country, but it's building at a very slow rate. Now that may accelerate with climate posture of the Biden Administration and for other reasons, including consumer awareness around environmental and change in demand. But combustion engines, we think, are going to be here through the decade in terms of demand and substantially there, if not fully through production. Having said that, in terms of the impact of us, we're a super prime lender. So whether it's a combustion engine or a hybrid or EV, we work with a view of very low default rates. And so marginal loss rates might increase a bit and have probably would anyway because we're at record highs in terms of bluebook values for use. So \u2013 but we don't see it as a big event. In terms of opportunity for us, it's one of the areas of environmentally sensitive financing that we're looking at. There are a series of other areas where we're actively engaged and extending credit in the \u2013 over time as we look back in the billions of dollars. And there may be an opportunity for us to do something unique with hybrids or EVs as we go forward. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful. And as a follow-up, Steve, can you give a bit more color on some of the things you're doing ahead of the TCF closing just to make sure you hit the ground running next year. Is most of the initial focus on insurance move integration versus maybe is it just too early to be thinking about the revenue synergy opportunity that is down the road? Or is that in the mix as well? Any color around that would be helpful. Steve Steinour : So when we announced, we talked about expense synergies, and we're fairly definitive, but we also alluded to revenue synergies. Our \u2013 to start with, our offerings, both consumer and business, are much more extensive than TCF. So it sets up a cross sell, something we've been working on, and we caught what we referred to it as optimal customer relationships. So we've been doing this for a decade. We have very good experience with cross-sell into the Firstmerit customer base. We expect to do as well or even better based on the learnings and experiences in the relative position. TCF also outsourced a number of businesses or products, which we manage directly. And so we'll expect lift out of those. So there's a variety of revenue initiatives, which we are pursuing, in some cases, we've already activated such as SBA lending Minneapolis, an activity that TCF didn't have. And so as we go forward, we'll expect these revenue initiatives. And we'll share them at a future point, will be significant upside to what we've presented in a summary level. So we'll detail where we expect to get them as we proceed. But the first order of business is to execute the committed expense takeout and to get the synergies on that front that we expected with the closing expected later this quarter and a conversion late in the third quarter. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Steve Alexopoulos of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Janet Lee : Good morning, this is Janet Lee on for Steve Alexopoulos. Just digging deeper into your commercial loan growth guidance, I understand that in your guidance of commercial loans being flat to modestly higher for 2021, what is your assumption around the level of commercial utilization for your C&I customers as compared to the current level? And could you also provide more color around like how that compares to pre-pandemic levels? Zach Wasserman : Sure. Thanks, Janet for the questions. This is Zach, I'll take it. Overall, as I mentioned in the comments, the expectation is, excluding PPP, low single-digit growth in commercial loans and approximately 1.5 percentage of that is from some modest line utilization. Overall, the expectation for line utilization is, it has been reset, and I'll come back and speak more specifically about the pre-pandemic comparisons as you asked. But just generally characterizing the expectation. What we've seen is relatively flat in general middle market lines. My baseline expectation is a modest improvement. Likewise, what we've seen on the vehicle floor plan side is actually some retrenchment from the end of last year to where we stand now. As we go forward, we're expecting some modest improvement in both of those. Together, those represent just under 1% asset growth expectation with my total asset growth. But even if you normalize that, I think the level of strong production we've got across both consumer and commercial, we do expect to drive accelerated loan growth overall on a net basis as we go forward. Just double-clicking into the line utilization expectations, pre-pandemic, we were running in the middle market line utilization, sort of low 40%. And right now, we're in the high 30%, to give you a sense. It's been roughly flat now for several months in a row. And I would expect it will be flat for a time before it starts to rise later in the year. But I think, as has been well publicized, elevated levels of liquidity across the system are contributing to our clients just not meeting those lines at this point. But everything we're hearing from them is that, ultimately, they expect to go back to a more typical financing posture and that those will start to solely normalize probably more in the back half late 2021 and continuing into 2022. On the vehicle floor plan side, historical levels are just around 80% of line utilization. By the end of the year, we have gotten to almost 61% to be precise in December. By the end of this quarter, we were at 51% to give you a sense. So it continues to tick down and has tick down even a little bit more into April. So we'll have to see. That one is really driven by the point specific auto manufacturer issues that have been very well documented in the popular press around microchip shortages and other component shortages. Everything we're hearing, though, is that, slowly, but surely that they are chipping away at that issue. The manufacturers and that vehicle will begin to flow at a faster rate in the back half of the year. My general expectations are relatively flat in that for the next several months before it starts to normalize and rise more again towards the very late part of 2021 with the longer-term expectation based on our client discussions. But they'll go back to historical levels of utilizing that financing, but probably well into the middle of 2022 based on supply. Janet Lee : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And just turning to \u2013 I want to talk through the new money yield that what yields new purchase securities are being put on to the book versus what's rolling off and same for new loan production? And also, what's your plan around deploying excess cash? And how much of that could be deployed into securities over the next several quarters? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. I'll take the first crack at it and then Derek Meyer, our Treasurer is in the room as well. Let me tack on as we go. On the security side, we feel really good at actually about where the yields are and what we were able to deploy with roughly $2 billion of net add during the quarter came on sort of around the 160 basis point level. As we think about other new many yields, generally, some modest pressure, but not overly so. I think in the commercial business around 0.25 point lower as we went into Q1 from Q4. CRE, likewise, around 30 basis points to 35 basis points lower, auto roughly stable. So we're seeing some modest down drops on new money, but not overly material, I would say, at this point. Most of the curve impacts have been brought into the pricing. As we take a step back and think about the posture around elevated liquidity, I would say that as we've continued to update our forecast, we've ratcheted higher the expectation for elevated levels of liquidity and deposits, as is indicated by our deposit guidance. And likewise, ratcheted out in time the duration that this phenomenon will last until it begins to normalize. So likely it will take several more quarters for that to slowly start to weigh in, and it will go all the way into 2022. So that gives us the cause to really look at the best ways to deploy that. Over time, you've seen us optimize our funding structure, and we'll continue to look for opportunity to do that to bring down funding costs using that. But I think as well, looking at whether it's appropriate over time to investment in rental securities is also part of the discussion. To be clear, liquidity is the primary objective in making sure that we're managing that well. And so we'll leg into and step into in a kind of phased basis any incremental moves on that and still working through it, nothing for us specifically to talk about there. But we'll continue to be dynamic in looking at it and just watching those trends and optimizing. Anything, Derek, you can tack on to what I said? Derek Meyer : No, I think you've covered it. We have reached a point with our BAU security strategy, where we need new money yields sort of equal to our run off yields, plus or minus 1.5. So a lot of it is going to happen with prepayment speeds and then what the yield curve shape is. I don't see a big change in trajectory. Janet Lee : Fine, thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Hey. Most of it's been handled. But can you \u2013 Steve, can you talk a little bit about retention and synergies that you saw on a FirstMerit? And also touch on, like you've got the 44 branches that you're closing, what kind of retention you get from those? And how you're thinking about TCF in terms of retention as well? Steve Steinour : We have a set of opportunities. Thanks, Jon. I'm sorry. We have a set of opportunities with TCF that are substantial in terms of retaining customers. If we think about Michigan, for example, even after our consolidations of branches, and in aggregate, there'll be more than 200 branches affected by consolidation and divestiture, we will still have number one branch share in Michigan by a factor of about 50%. So we'll be quite a bit larger than the next bank with physical distribution. So that provides an enormous set of opportunities for us in terms of retention, and we have had very high retention coming out of FirstMerit and other in-store branch consolidations. Remember, we can consolidate about 4% of the franchise every year on average. And so our retention efforts, where we decide to drop remaining ATMs outreach, we have a process we call white glove treatment that's been well-defined over the years and developed. Combination of those activities, the uniqueness of the product set, all day deposit, 24-hour grace, safety zone now, things like that also give us a distinct retention advantage. So we expect to have very high retention on the TCF side of the consumer, and on the business side, again, better product, more capabilities as we go forward. But it starts with winning minds and arts of our soon to be new colleagues, and we're actively working that. We would expect that would be successful as it was with Firstmerit. That will set up then this retention of customers through the conversion and beyond. And the product menu has just being substantially different, much bigger and better in many respects, will be to the benefit of the customer base, both consumers, small and medium-sized businesses. So we're very, very optimistic. On the specialty finance side, their equipment finance in ours is almost hand in glove. The combination will be extraordinarily effective. And they have a great team, we think we do as well, and this hand in glove will give us opportunities to further grow that business. We're excited about their inventory finance business. Got some great people in these business lines as well as the company generally, and we're going to be a stronger company as a consequence of the combination. So very bullish about the expectations, both on retention and revenue synergies as we go forward. And we'll get the expense synergies largely complete this year. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Zach, can you touch on mortgage expectations for the second quarter? I know it's kind of a mixed bag, but it looks like originations were pretty flat, what kind of thoughts do you have for the next quarter? Zach Wasserman : Yes. I don't have the Q2 right in front of, but just broadly, still thinking more just continues to beat expectations, frankly, and be very robust. I think the \u2013 overall, for the full year, expecting the revenues to be down between 15% and 20% year-over-year basis just off of the torrent pace at the 2020 represented. But most of that grow over challenge really occurs in the second half of the year. Volumes continue to be very, very robust. And I think, if you just, at an industry level, you've probably seen even mortgage banker association or ratcheting higher volume expectations for the year. I think if there's something that we're watching carefully is the salable spread. And that continues to be elevated above historical levels, but it could move quickly. So we'll see. But so far, it seems to be holding up relatively well also. So that's the expectation that we've got. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Thank you for your questions and interest in Huntington. I'm pleased with our strong start to what will be an important year for Huntington as we execute on our strategic initiatives as well as close and integrate the TCF acquisition. I'm increasingly optimistic about the opportunities we see in 2021 and beyond, and I'm confident of our ability to capitalize on the accelerating economic recovery. The disciplined execution of our strategies, coupled with the pending acquisition, set us up to grow revenue from a larger customer base for which we will deepen existing and acquired customer relationships, resulting in top quartile financial performance. We have a strong foundation of enterprise risk management and deeply embedded stock ownership mentality, which aligns our board management and colleagues. Again, thank you for your support and interest. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Mark Muth : Thanks Joe. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Steve Steinour : Thanks Mark and happy birthday. Welcome everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington with our top 0.5 bank holding company with $175 billion in total assets. The TCF acquisition expanded our leadership position and equity in Michigan both through scale and market such as Chicago and added new growth markets in the twin cities Denver and Milwaukee. Importantly, we have number one branch share within our footprint, which allows us to leverage our brands, convenience and digital channels to continue to officially grow the customer base. Huntington brings an expanded tariff capabilities to these markets and through the TCF customer base, including middle-market and corporate banking with specialty verticals, treasury management, capital markets, trusted investment and insurance products in addition to our number one in the nation SBA lending program.  So we're excited by the opportunity to introduce our fair play approach and leading digital offerings to our customers in these markets. Over the past several years, we've been pleased by the number of independent affirmations of the superior customer service. Our colleagues provide the customer centered products and services we've introduced just last month. Date hour announced it's been ranked highest in customer satisfaction amongst regional banks for our mobile app for the third consecutive year. Additionally, we were ranked first in our region for consumer banking customer satisfaction. Now these are important affirmations of the considerable investments we've made in our culture and digital technology. Slide four provides an overview of hikes and strategy to build the leading people first digitally powered bank in the nation. Huntington is a purpose driven company and organic growth and sustainable top core tile, financial performance remain core tenants of our strategic vision. The acquisition of TCF is additive on both fronts, as it supports continued organic growth opportunities and allows us to leverage the incremental scale to drive efficiencies and deliver top core tile financial returns. Mark Muth : Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides the highlights for the second quarter, which includes closing the TCF transaction, delivering strong new loan production and maintaining solid credit quality as well as robust liquidity and capital positions. On a fully reported basis, including all impacted the acquisition. We reported a net loss for common share of $0.05. For the second quarter earnings were impacted by acquisition expenses of $269 million. And the so-called Cecil double counts provision expense of $294 million earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were positive $0.35 per share. Mark Muth : Thank you, Zach. We will now take questions. Yeah. That as a courtesy to your peers, each person asked one question and one related follow-up and then if that person had any additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : .Our first question is from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Scott Siefers : Good Morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey so I think one of the main issues over the past few months has been the, sort of the higher expense guides and a couple of those. Now that TCF is in the mix. It's a little tougher to tell exactly what's going on, on from sort of the standalone Huntington basis. I wonder if you could just speak or provide some colour on you know, how we can feel confident that sort of, that guide that you offered earlier in the year about Huntington's stand-alone growth indeed peaking and we'll normalize from here how, how does that play out? What should we be watching for from the outside to understand the expense control, et cetera? Zach Wasserman : It's a great question, Scott. Thanks. This is Zach. I'll take that one. So sort of two big vendors I would, I would offer to you. One is on an underlying Huntington basis, as you noted very much executing to our prior plan, which has been elevated levels of expense in the first two quarters of the year, driven by our investments, bringing that growth rate back down into the low single digits by the second half of the year. Everything that we're -- we're completely executing to that plan and everything I've seen in terms of forecast for standalone Huntington our in our track up until the close of the acquisition mid-June was very much corroborating that in fact, due to was coming in a bit lower in terms of overall expense growth. And the outlook continues to be, as we disclosed in terms of overall expense growth and the outlook continues to be, as we disclosed. Then secondly, the TCF cost synergies are very much on track and we're executing on that as we speak. The branch rationalization, as Steve noted in the comments right away, the systems conversion is planned. Personnel decisions are finalized. We've completed a lot of the vendor conversion exceeding the progress on real estate consolidations. So the majority of those cost saves from the TCF acquisitional benefit 2022, which was the full run rate of being present in the back half of the year. And then as we go into '23, excluding one-time cost, which, which clearly would be noisy on an organic basis. We expect a step up into Q3 as we get a full quarter of the TCF expense base. And then from there, beginning of Q4 over the next six quarters, see gradual reduction each quarter as the synergies are realized pretty steady, no, no major step down through this point in our outlook. Scott Siefers : Okay, Perfect. So, absolute declines and expenses sort of starting in the -- in the fourth quarter, sounds like that. Okay, perfect. And then switching gears a little, I think Zach, you talked about the margin going into the two nineties beginning in the third quarter. Can you sort of specify and I apologize if I miss this and taking my notes, but what would be included in that and is that -- does that include PPP, forgiveness fees, purchase, accounting benefits, et cetera. Zach Wasserman : It does include the dynamics we see around PPP, which move around in single digits on the quarter to quarter basis. But, but doesn't include the benefit of PAA will be a couple basis points of benefit. So it's not overly significant. I think PAA give you a sentence. It's three basis points in Q3 and a negative two to 22. So it's relatively small on PAA. So it really the core underlying NIM that will be in the two nineties. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you guys very much. Operator : Next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ken Zerbe : All right. Great. Thanks. Good morning. In terms of loans, obviously it's kind of hard to see the, sort of the core loan growth just given the, the merger with TCF this quarter. Can you just talk about, I guess what was sort of that underlying growth in loans? And I'm also kind of curious, I know you guys sound pretty positive about the growth outlook in the second half of the year for loan balances, but, but how does that play out in the near term, just given supply chain constraints and sort of generally weaker overall industry growth? I mean, is your positive outlook more weighted towards the fourth quarter than three healers? It pretty split between the two? Zach Wasserman : Yeah. Great question. Kind of all this is that I'll take it just a couple of things I would share with you one to answer your question about kind of the underlying Huntington growth. And I will call caveat out to say that we're, we're deeply integrating the businesses at this point. So over time it'll be more and more difficult for us to kind of segregate in this way, but generally what we were seeing was consumer growth kind of close to 1% and commercial growth just slightly less than flat. So overall it was pretty flat. Particularly when you strip out the, the decline of PPP a quarter-to-quarter. Going forward, the more importantly, I think the two dynamics that we've been seeing, we tried to kind of illustrate it in the prepared remarks, continue to be very much think the thing to focus on. Firstly, new production is quite strong at, or better than our plan know on the, on the consumer side, surprising Canadian strength in mortgage and auto and then other commercial side record calling activity, driving pipelines up both sequentially from Q1. And I would also say very, very healthy growth versus 2019. And so that's giving us a lot of confidence in where new production is going. And it's really just a question of watching therefore, the second factor, which is the impacts from the elevated liquidity in the system and supply chain issues on existing line utilization. And so I think the net outcome of this from what we're seeing is probably about 1% additional growth pressure in the back half of this year. And whereas at the beginning of the year, I guided for one to 3% loan growth and then by June at the Morgan Stanley conference that we were talking about sort of the low end of that range, my expectation now is sort of roughly flat average in the second half of the year with growth, really starting to rebound as we get out into 2022 and go forward. I think there's some pretty clear sides, Rocky wisdom here. I think on the on the places where their supply chains are really pressuring inventory utilization and auto and it certainly in the new TCF acquired inventory finance book, we're seeing OEM production increase and our clients want to use these lines. So I think over the course of 22 and 23, we'll see that $5billion to $6 billion come back. And the new production really shows no signs of slowing down at this point. So, and the new production really shows no signs of slowing down at this point. So we're bullish about the future. And I think that throughout the course of '22, you see those conditions. Ken Zerbe : All right. Perfect. And then just as a -- as a up question dock on the NIM, the 10 basis point increase the second and three Q, how much of that is driven just simply by the addition of TCF and all the purchase counting kind of issues versus the balance sheet optimization or management initiatives that you guys talked about? Zach Wasserman : Sequentially much of it is driven by the TCF acquisition, but I think so over time, the balance sheet optimization program is providing a great floor for us and really contributing to what would have otherwise been yield curve impacts pushing it lower. So that's, that's probably the best answer I can give you. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning, everyone. Let's start for you, Zach. So there's obviously a lot going on this quarter. Well, we look at the $0.35 of adjusted EPS. Is that a run rate that you can grow from? Zach Wasserman : Yeah, I think the outlook we've got for earnings is, is good. Given the TCF synergies coming in, clearly, it's going to be a noisy couple quarters here just with closing the acquisition, but our expectations will continue to drive forward. Very much according to the expectation we've done going all the way back to December of last year. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of staying on offense, right over the last few quarters, you guys have discussed increasing the pace of investment, right? New hires, and we know M&A deals are quite distracting, right? When you're trying to put two companies together, are you able to keep that momentum on offense? If you really need to turn the focus internal to make sure this integration goes seamless as possible, Mark Muth : We've been doing both all along the court has been executing really well. We still have some good products just launched last month on the consumer side. And I think what Zach earlier subject to the, the, the reduction in in your line utilizations and floor plan rates the, the pipelines have been good and we're closing at or above budget. So we've come into this quarter strong and in comparison to the 2019 where we had a more normalized comparison. So we like what we see in the core, and we're at the same time, really doing a break teams are doing a great job on the integration where either on schedule or schedule, and we've been able to make some really good decisions around the talent within TCF combined to make, to make Huntington a stronger company. So they're, they're pleased with what we see lot of work yet to do, but we're moving rapidly. And by the end of October, the branch consolidations are done. The major systems conversions are done. And, and we're -- we're to enter '22 substantially set, which is probably close to a record time with a June closing for, for the TPF transaction. Really like what we see we're competent about both being able to deliver the poor. We're very focused on that as well as get the economics of the integration. Operator : Our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed. EbrahimPoonawala: Just a question, a couple of questions, one talk to us a little bit on the consumer side. Like you've done a lot Steve, since taking over in terms of making it a very consumer friendly bank I guess to me two things, one, the competitive pressure that you're seeing from either the fintechs or the Neo banks around consumer fees and how you're thinking about it, where do you see the most risk? And do you see a particular risk to TCF deposit customer base, which seems to be the target for some of these banks that are coming up with different texts and Neo banks? Thank you. Steve Steinour : We've been focused on the consumer side. Since 2009, we launched fair play in 2010, we've had a series of feature function benefits starting with 24 hour grades off the Astro street checking product. That's been a core product, and we build out the product lines. We've continued to innovate over the last decade, all day deposit and more recently safety zone a year ago at this time and different things. So we're, we're disrupting ourselves against the game plan of 10 different things. So we're, we're disrupting ourselves against the game plan of, of trying to be the premier consumer bank in our footprint. And I think we were achieving that. I think in the last nine years, we've had 60, 80 power number ones in consumer bank. In our footprint, you have the three mobile apps in a row like what we're seeing, we're not done. We have some really interesting ideas that we'll be working on through, through this year and well into next to, to further distinguish and provide growth opportunities for us. Now, in the context of TCF, I see a fair blanket thanking philosophy just as a huge advantage for that customer base. And I think from the early reaction of our, our new colleagues from TCF and the branches they're wildly enthusiastic, and I think the customer base will, will be as well. I see that as a big growth opportunity for us, including our capacity across process. So the operating processes, procedures, et cetera, we have complimented by our Fairplay products and, and this emphasis and focus on customer service, I think, is going to make our, our, our, our combination incredibly powerful on the consumer side. I'm very bullish there and we were competing with the -- and the the larger banks in our footprint for years it's, it's actually made us better. So we're, we'll we'll look forward to, to continuing to adapt and innovate and get growth on the consumer banking business. EbrahimPoonawala: That's helpful to you. Thank you. And this is a follow up, I think the other side of Steve's question, you have been relatively acquisitive over the last few years, as you get through the TCF integration over the next few quarters, just talk to us in terms of need for M&A, he didn't tell me the scale or expanding geography is like, is any of that a priority over the medium term or not? Steve Steinour : The focus is on yeah, completely this integration. Well, the reason the economics were better and driving before and, and, and that that's, that's the focus. So we're, we're really grateful and pleased with the talented new colleagues we have joining us. There's a training natural absorption that will go on over the next year or so. And and again, that's where we're focused. Operator : Thank you. Oh, that's the question is from Brian Cohen with Autonomous, please proceed. Brian Cohen : Hi. I'm just thinking over the next couple of quarters. I mean it's always tough with these deals to figure out what's really going on. What clearly have the benefit of your qualitative comments? And you've been very clear that you're upbeat on what's going on so far, but if you put yourself in our shoes for the next 6 to 9 months, and, and you're kind of picking up the financial separate quarter are there two or three things that you would say, look, these are the, you should watch for these three metrics and this kind of what's, what's going to be good? And this is what's going to be this is what would be the benchmark you should really focus on for the next six to nine months. Basically I pick up the third quarter financials and I'm trying to figure out are things going well, what would be the two or three things you would really key in on? Zach Wasserman : Yeah, it's a great question. This is Zach I can I fully understand it. And, and, and frankly internally what, we're very much focused on ensuring we have visibility as well what I'm watching. Cause I think the same things you should have, which is this sequential loan growth from where we stand today. As I mentioned, I think it will be somewhat flattish here in the back half of the year, but, but I do think that conditions will be improving, but we'll be watching that line utilization that drag, that it added goes away will kind of reveal the underlying strength in the new production. Well I think the, the driver has that's sort of point 1. Point 2 is that as we talked about, our expectation is in the two nineties. I think that'll move potentially based on the pace of the deposit runoff and that kind of 18 basis points of elevated liquidity drag coming off. I have confidence that our forecasts are with a lot of actions and specific plans to drive it, but I think that's the thing I would watch, secondly. Third we haven't talked about it a lot here, but, but fees are a real bright spot for us in terms of the focus areas for our strategy and, and the growth that is driving principally in those four areas. I mentioned in my comments, carton payments, debit, and the commercial card business card, just on fire treasury management, continuing to try to track forward very, very well. Our capital markets business growing very nicely year over year and sequentially, and then wealth and investments, which we're seeing record sales activity, really strong revenue growth as well. So I watched those very carefully. And then I think lastly, the expenses I think and then I think lastly, the expenses I think we've got a question earlier about, about the trajectory of expenses. I do think it'll pop up just from a kind of calendarization perspective into the third quarter, as we have a full quarter of TCF, but then you'll, you'll see it every quarter, take it down on a nominal basis over the next few quarters, as, as our synergies are realized and kind of wave by way of basis. And then getting to that run rate level of performance that are in our medium term targets as we get into the second half of '22. And as we certainly go into the full year of '23, so that's, that's our operating plan. And and that's certainly what I would urge you to stay focused on as well. Additionally the, the credit profile will continue to improve. We've tried to be conservative with both our marks and our use of discretion or not pool as it relates to the new GCF portfolio. And you'll see, you'll see a improvement on credit class, NPA, NPL net charge offs as well. Brian Cohen : That's really great. I appreciate all the detail from both of them. Operator : Our next question is from David Konrad with KBW David Konrad : Good morning. I was just wondering if you had help us out a little bit on next quarters expenses make sure we're all kind of in the range of the same, the same starting point as you put TCF together with, with H1for the full quarter? Zach Wasserman : I hate them to give so overly precise guidance, but implication X-one timers will pop up a couple of $100 million. This is the run rate into next quarter. So around $1billion of runway expenses X-one timers and then started to tick down from there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached -- so there's one more question from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Jon Arfstrom : Good job. Thanks for letting me sneak in a question for you back on Steve on, on the EPS question. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic on credit. Can you give us some idea of what you're thinking in terms of provisioning as well? Are we still in this reserve reduction credit improvement mode for the company, or are there any nuances in terms of how you've marked TCF and what you see on credit where we're going to flip back to a positive provision? Zach Wasserman : Hey Jon, it's Zach. Let me take that, so from my standpoint we've been releasing reserves now for, for two quarters and, and within that we're seeing the positive impacts on the economy and our product metrics are continuing to improve with the TCF mark. We spent a lot of time on that. We feel we have an absolutely right. And so we would not expect to have to build reserves from here. We continue to expect the economy to improve and, and our credit metrics, as Steve just mentioned we also expect to see reductions in a credit class and MPA's, and charge offs continuing a downward trend. So if all of that holds true, I would expect to see continued releases looking forward. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. Steve, when does Fairplay come into the TCF markets and what, what kind of impact do you expect that to have? Steve Steinour : John will be introducing Huntington products when we do the conversion on Columbus day. And I think that will be the moment where with, with some advertising or marketing, along with the highly engaged a new college from TCF, we'll be able to, to really make that case with what we're talking about here. We have to get through the conversion and, and, and settle it down. Usually takes a couple of weeks, but, but we had such great products in comparison that they're very, our branch colleagues are, they're very enthusiastic. And so it's an exciting moment for us. We will translate that into our customer base and, and we'll be launching marketing campaigns in advance to sort of set up the momentum that we hope to deliver. Number one, we -- when we announced the DCF deal, we talked about the expense, take out the half the equation, but we were optimistic about, about the revenue potential in this. And it's not been sized. It wasn't sized for discussion that it's not today, but, but it's looking really good. And and we have a great group of new colleagues that will be able to deliver this worth. So we're, we're, we're, we're, we're very optimistic about our future together. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. You kind of had on what I wanted to ask okay. You kind of had on what I wanted to ask also, but do you have any early revenue synergy examples that you can share? I know you don't want to size it, but any examples so far? Zach Wasserman : Well, I doing a lot of calling and so the vignettes that I'm picking up from customers our customers, TCF customers, even prospects, are very, very encouraging. We've never, we have a much broader set of products and services than TCF. So when we're sitting around talking about what we can do, like a, I think it was yesterday with a very large middle market company, and they're asking us questions on a detailed basis about the venue. TCF just didn't have those products and capabilities. And, and, and, and so being able to introduce those into a discussion are look very, very promising. I think there'll be a 40 year relationship removed from one of our competitors. So again, this combination has a lot of potential and the breadth of our products and services, both on the business or commercial side of the service side are very encouraging. This is to tack onto that one to me, if I think about the synergies I'm equally bullish and opposite, you just isn't. I was thinking about them sort of in, in, in a few major buckets, there's the sort of deepening engagement with products, commercial capital markets, treasury management, our card and commercial card, or payments businesses in consumer, all the things that Steve just referenced in terms of elevated level of share of wallet, given the stronger products and, and, and an accelerated acquisition with the particularly the digital capabilities. And then lastly, geographic opportunity for, for us to expand it to the new, big markets, Denver, Minneapolis, deepening into a lot of the markets that we exist today, I think already beginning to hire staff and really start to penetrate those markets to big three buckets that I'm seeing. So we're moving fairly quickly just to pick up on Zack so we can emanate this a little bit. We've we're, ahead of the hiring that we had at the pro-forma on our commercial or wealth and business. Thank you in a couple of those new markets and the power of the combination in terms of just the sheer magnitude of what we have in Michigan and Chicago is very, very exciting to us. So a lot of work to do in front of us, that's where we're focused on driving organic growth and getting this integration in great shape, but we like what we see. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Thanks a lot. Very helpful. And, and mark congrats and thanks over the years. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies, please proceed. Ken Usdin : Good morning guys. Just, can you remind us on your, on the medium term goals for Row and efficiency ratio, just what your timeframe is for that, and then also, how do you contemplate what rates and credit you build into that? Zach Wasserman : Yeah, this is Zach. I'll take that one. Great question. I appreciate the opportunity to elaborate and be more specific. So medium term for us, it was really kind of the next four to eight quarters. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks and in a few questions, I think you'll see that the deal economics sort of accrue very substantially into '22, and they'll kind of build over the course of the year where the run rate is particularly the second half of the year will be very much evidence of that. And then the full year '23 should, should very much be those, those metrics. And so that's our focus. So back half '22 to '23 and I think the, the credit environment that we're visioning and the part in is continued tracking forward of benefits as rich just noted in this this answer just a few moments ago that that probably will rubber that some incremental reserve releases here mainly in the back half of '21, I would expect. And then on the forward yield curve basis, really just planning on the, on the Ford yield curve as it exists today. So and you can, you can, you can see that too still represents a constructive environment, particularly as you get kind of through '22 and into the, the, the course of '23 but, but really on a NIM basis that, that will manifest itself into the two nineties, which is my forecast sort of what would that entire period. Ken Usdin : Got it and then just one follow-up on the merger saves, so with the conversions finalizing in October, is it fair to say that we'll get run rate full run rate saves in, in one queue and then on top of that, like, how do you feel just about your original cost save forecast? Do you see any potential upside and if there were to be upside, do you expect to let that fall? Or what could you reinvest some of it? Thanks guys. Zach Wasserman : Yeah. Good, good. It's a good additional question in terms of the cost, they are still very much on track to deliver what we committed and that's the number we're really aiming for. And it's not, it's not sort of a perfect step down of costs as you, as you sort of alluded potentially as a form of your question, really, there was sort of thinking about traunches of, of cost reductions. That'll begin as I mentioned in the fourth quarter and start to kind of each quarter thereafter drive incremental benefits on a quarter to quarter basis, really by the second half of the year, you'll sort of see the full totality of it. There's a few pieces that will carry forward in terms of additional execution into the early part of next year. So so we'll see a steady reduction in expenses for starting for Q4 and then continuing for about four or five quarters thereafter. Operator : Our next question again from Brian Ford, please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Oh, hi. I just wanted to circle back to that three Q expense number and definitely recognize you mentioned you're not trying to give point guidance, but now I'll ask you about point guidance to make sure I'm not misinterpreting. So you're saying start with a billion and then add a couple hundred million. So, so something like $1.2 billion, $1.25 billion, but with a wide range is I just want to make sure, like? Zach Wasserman : No, well, let me, let me clarify. Let me clarify. I think I would be looking at the numbers. It's roughly a $250 million higher quarter to quarter on a growth rate, just a nominal basis from Q2 and Q3. That's just the sort of quarter realization if you will, of the full quarter of GCF a run rate expenses before many of the synergies started to take place. So precisely roughly $250 million quarter to quarter hiring in expenses, X-one timers into Q3. Unidentified Analyst : And the base that's higher off of is roughly $1billion even, or, or what what's $250 million higher than what? Zach Wasserman : Yeah, the numbers I'm looking at $800 million. I'm not sure that the numbers you're looking at and you can take it offline to help you clarify more precisely. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. But you said the number you're looking at is what? Zach Wasserman : The number in the earnings release X, the one-time items that the 803 it's the starting point. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, perfect. No, that's, that's exactly what I was trying to clarify. I was working off the wrong base. Okay, So $250 million higher off 803 with obviously lots of moving parts around integration and stuff. So that's kind of a range to start rather than a point guidance? Zach Wasserman : That's a good way to think about it. I appreciate that. I was about to plug in a number that was about 20% too high in my model. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research, please proceed. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the outlook for low growth to be flat in the second half, but improving in 2022 and one to ask if you could tie that outlook in with what's implicit in that outlook relative to the, the, the, the commentary you had around labor force shortages continuing and, and just to the extent that the expectation is that that's going to improve as we look to the fall and beyond as extended unemployment benefits for Barrett's and other stimulus sort of a bait, is that sort of the expectation that's, that's contributing to that, or maybe, maybe just some color on, on what's implicit in that outlook? Steve Steinour : It's -- this is Steve. Bill, you have an environment that is, is changing is improving. We hope on the employment side that is the number one issue for businesses. At least in our footprint, they just can't get enough labor. And so the, the change in benefits, we, we hope will spur more employment, which -- which will translate over time to higher growth rates and financing needs. But it's, it's, it's not an immediate correlation. It just takes some, some period of time to burn in. And, and we expect that we'll, we'll, we'll see that feel it and experiences during the fourth quarter, but there's also with the ten-year reduction, there's some level of prepayment that we would expect to occur on some of our portfolio. So we're, we're trying to incorporate all of the changes with the guidance that you, you got from, from Zack. We're not optimistic that live utilizations improve in any material sense this year at this point. And that is that that's a bit of a change from where we were at the end of the first quarter. Bill Carcache : Understood. And I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on the auto side of the business and ask if you could give some color on your discussions with your dealer clients, in terms of what you're hearing and hearing from them around their appetite for keeping four plan levels, lower versus history, even, even the supply chain issues are resolved. How are you guys thinking about the possibility that we could end up below historical levels of inventory? Steve Steinour : Well, it reminds me of 2010 and '11, when the bankruptcy is occurred and inventories were drawn down and that's like, everybody's going to keep floor levels lower than the the car companies are going to be more judicious and try and get pricing versus volume. And that lasted for a couple of quarters, but there is a volume share game that, that history has shown that, that the OEM's want. And they -- they have the ability to push delivery. It's not just the dealers pulling it. So, so we believe over time, the floorplan inventories will essentially get back to where they were. A lot of the dealers, particularly in this low rate environment would love to have a lot more inventory and, and they're, they're getting deliveries and it's in a good percentage of the cases. They're all those are pre-sold. So they're on the last very briefly, and they're still phenomenal where people come in thinking they know what they want, but they're, they're there once they experience the next version of, or, or the additional features that are available in the car that there's a, there's a sales process and generally a selection that still has some physical components. So at Sonic, I think the dealers will be essentially in the position they were back in '18 and '19 over time though. I don't think that's a '21, and it may not even fully be in '22, but by '23, we think that, that that'll be normalized assuming that the pandemic stays under control. Bill Carcache : Thank you, Steve. That's helpful. Operator : Before we move on to the next just real quick, we got an email question. Question is you talked about the buyback, but you didn't talk about the dividend. Could you give us what your thinking on the dividend? Zach Wasserman : Well, we typically make a dividend decisions in the fourth quarter. It's a board decision. We'll, we'll be rerunning models now with TCF data and, and and look at that on our priority, send that changed organic growth dividends and all of the use at this point. That's about as far as like, go at this point. So Joe's next question? No more questions. So Steve, I would like to turn the call back to you for any closing remarks. Zach Wasserman : Well, thank you all for your interest in Huntington, we continue to execute our core strategies as as you heard earlier, and I'm confident we'll drive both near term and long-term returns for our shareholders. We're all patient committed to deliver the economics and the recently closed TCF acquisition while the organic growth will them driven by our investments remains intact. So we're optimistic about the opportunities in front of us confident in our ability to capitalize on the improving economic recovery. I believe the disciplined execution of our strategy will drive top ports out financial performance over the medium and long-term. And we clearly build a strong foundation of enterprise risk management and a deeply embedded stock ownership mentality, which aligns our board management colleagues with our shareholders. So thank you for your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you very much for your participation. Have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, Luthania. Welcome, everyone and good morning. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A portion will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this Slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Tim. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our third quarter, we deliver good core performance and made enormous progress with the TCF integration. Let me begin on Slide 3. Thanks to the hard work of our colleagues, we're on track to complete the TCF integration as planned, and deliver the resulting deal economics. This combination at scale, density, new markets and new specialty businesses. At the core of Huntington, we are a purpose driven company with a vision to build the leading people first digitally powered bank in the nation. We remain focused on our core objectives to drive organic growth and to deliver sustainable top quartile financial performance. On Slide 4, our third quarter performances included a full quarter benefit from TCF and record total revenue. We delivered good growth in fee income, that low growth excluding PPP and improving credit metrics. Just over a week ago, we successfully completed the conversion of TCF to Huntington systems. And we now offer an integrated set of products capabilities and experiences to our customers. As a result of the great efforts of our colleagues, we were able to complete the conversion in just 10 months since the announcement of the transaction. We've completed most of the actions to drive our targeted cost synergies, and are on track to deliver all of the announced cost reductions. With the conversion behind us, we're now able to focus 1000s of colleagues on new business development activities to close up year strong and carry that momentum into '22. We are investing in these revenue producing colleagues as well as new capabilities in the expanded markets. We're seeing substantial momentum in many of our initiatives, including targeted areas of deep revenue generation like wealth and capital markets as well as cards and payments. Both consumer and commercial loan productions continue to be robust, and commercial pipelines are up over 30% from a year ago, and new production activity has nearly doubled. Additionally, we were pleased to be ranked number one nationally for the SBA 7(a) seven eight lending by volume, marking the fourth consecutive year we've been recognized in the past five. As the recovery continues, we will dynamically manage our overall expense base and look for ways to drive incremental efficiencies across the bank. We intend to self fund the investment capacity necessary for strategic initiatives that will drive additional revenue growth in the years ahead. Our strategy is centered on supporting customers banking where and when they want and meeting them to their preferred channel. As part of that strategy, we are continually optimizing our distribution network; we will be consolidating 62 branches in the first quarter of '22 equal to 6% of the combined branch network. And these are in addition to the 180 branch closures announced as part of the TCF transaction. Importantly, we will continue to retain the number one share of branches in both Ohio and Michigan. In addition to branch consolidations, we are continuing to diligently optimize roles and resources within the bank. We're committed to delivering positive operating leverage as we did annually for a decade leading up to '21. Finally on the capital front, we accelerated our sharing repurchase in the quarter as well as announced an increase to the quarterly dividend. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the performance and outlook for Huntington as well as our commitment to our shareholders to actively manage our capital levels. Slide 5 provides an update on the TCF integration. When we announced the transaction, we saw strong potential for expense synergies, as we leverage the benefits of scale, but to also drive additional organic growth. And today, I can say that we're even more excited about the revenue opportunities in front of us. The combination of new growth markets, and increased density, the addition of more than one and a half million customers, and expanded specialty capabilities collectively set up our future revenue growth. Let me share a couple of the most compelling aspects. In middle market and mid corporate banking, we're now bringing greater scale in Chicago, Milwaukee, in addition to new capabilities in the Twin Cities and Denver, with expanded coverage and product offerings; we're already gaining traction with early wins, including capital markets and treasury management fees. In Consumer and Business Banking, we're deploying Huntington's capabilities, products and services across the entire customer base following conversion. Combined with our fair play philosophy, this will greatly enhance the customer experience, and as we've demonstrated previously, will accelerate customer acquisition and improve retention, and with Huntington's digital and competitive product set we will deepen our customer relationships. Additionally, we are bringing award winning SBA lending platform and growing our wealth and private banking customer base in our newly expanded markets. Our investments are well timed, as we're seeing continued robust economic recovery in our footprint. Our regions have seen economic activity expand year-to-date faster than the national average, as well as higher labor force participation. We see a unique moment in time to capitalize on these revenue opportunities as our local economies continue to perform very well. We are entering a new era at Huntington with momentum we look forward to growth in the years ahead. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks Steve, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, we reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.22 for the third quarter, which included acquisition expenses of $234 million. Earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were $0.35, return on tangible common equity or ROTC came in at 11.5% for the quarter, adjusted for the acquisition related notable items, ROTC was 17.9%. As we expected and consistent with guidance we provided in September, we were pleased to see loan balances ex-PPP grow in the third quarter driven by robust new production. With continued strong liquidity, we're actively managing the balance sheet and have grown the securities portfolio by $3.7 billion from the end of the second quarter. Deposit balances were reduced by $847 million as a result of the branch divestiture. Excluding the divestiture, deposit balance has remained relatively stable on a period end basis. Loans associated with the divestiture totaled $209 million. Fee income was another bright spot where we continued -- where we saw continued momentum in our capital markets, cards and payments, treasury management and wealth and investment businesses. As Steve noted, we've been actively managing our capital and we're pleased to complete $500 million of share repurchases in the third quarter. We also announced $0.05 increase to the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter, which takes us to an annualized dividend rate of $0.62 per share. Finally, credit quality continued to improve with net charge-offs of 20 basis points, while nonperforming assets decreased to 12% from the prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 7, period and loan balances totaled $110.6 billion, excluding PPP, loan balances increased by $367 million during the quarter with underlying growth in C&I, Mortgage, Auto and RV Marine portfolios. On the commercial side, while PPP and auto dealer floor plan balances were lower, all other C&I loans increased by net $466 million during the quarter, driven by growth in asset finance and core C&I. We're seeing very encouraging trends from new commercial loan production and pipelines that continues to grow both year-over-year and sequentially. Consumer growth was somewhat offset by marginal pressure from the continued run off of the home equity portfolio. Additionally, we continue to observe solid activity levels in our consumer portfolios with Residential Mortgage, RV Marine and Automobile, all continuing to post sequential quarter balance growth. Auto saw strongest third quarter for production activity to date with, while mortgage continued to see robust origination activity in the quarter. Excluding PPP, we believe the trough for underlying loan balances is behind us. And we expect continued modest growth from these levels in the fourth quarter. With respect to commercial portfolio specifically, we expect to see momentum accelerate as we move through the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. Moving on to Slide 8, as noted previously, total deposit balances excluding the divestiture were relatively stable. We continue to optimize funding given our strong liquidity levels and reduced higher cost CDs by $395 million. Overall, we continue to see much of the excess liquidity remained fairly sticky as core commercial deposit balances increased during the quarter. Turn to Slide 9, FTE net interest income increased, primarily driven by the full quarter benefit of TCF. Net interest income increased by $323 million, while net interest margin was 2.9%, both driven by the acquired TCF assets, excess liquidity moderate slightly during the quarter, with $8.1 billion of cash at the Fed at quarter end, on an average basis for the quarter, excess liquidity represented the drag on margin of approximately 23 basis points. Core net interest income excluding PPP and accretion was $1,085 million. We expect core net interest income to grow from these levels on absolute dollar basis in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. We're positioned to be asset sensitive today. And we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to become increasingly asset sensitive to capture the benefit from expected future higher interest rates. This includes the hedge rollouts, as well as the addition of pay fixed swaps. On June 30, our model net interest income assets sensitivity and up 100 basis points scenario was 2.9% based on the deliberate actions we took during the quarter, we increased our asset sensitivity to 4.0%. And we continue to dynamically manage the balance sheet going forward. Over the course of the quarter, we terminated select downside rate protection hedges and added $6 billion of forward pay fixed swaps. Turning to Slide 10, noninterest income increased, primarily driven by the addition of TCF fee income. Several of our businesses performed quite well in the quarter, cards and payments benefited from higher customer transaction volumes. Mortgage banking performed well due to higher production and relatively higher saleable spreads, and wealth and investments continue to be driven by positive net asset flows. Capital Markets income also grew driven by solid performance and interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange and syndications. Turned to Slide 11, total noninterest expense came in at approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter, including the $234 million of notable items. Excluding these items, noninterest expense totaled $1.05 million, primarily driven by the full quarter TCF expenses. Our overall outlook for the magnitude of expense reductions is unchanged from prior guidance. The timing to realize these benefits, however, has accelerated due to our actions to drive realization of cost savings. As a result, we continue to expect that while Q3 was the high watermark for core expenses, they should benefit earlier than we previously thought as they stepped down into the fourth and first quarters. Core expenses on an absolute dollar basis should trail down throughout 2022. As we recognize the benefits of the TCF cost synergies while continuing to invest in the initiative to drive top line revenue growth. Slide 12 highlights our well capitalized balance sheet, as well as a few highlights from the recent capital return actions. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter of 9.6%, well within our medium term 9% to 10% operating guidelines. Over the past quarter we focused on returning capital to our shareholders in alignment with our capital priorities. We executed over half of the $800 million share repurchase program following the authorization at the moment and we were pleased to have recently announced an increase to the common stock dividends. As you can see on Slide 13, our quarter ending allowance for credit losses represented 1.99% of total loans down from 2.08% at prior quarter end. The improved economic outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a reserve release of $117 million for the third quarter. Additional key credit quality metrics are shown on Slide 14, further reflecting our improving credit profile, net charge-offs represented an annualized 20 basis points of average loans and leases. Most of the lowest levels in recent history, well below our target range of 35 to 55 basis points on average through the cycle. Consumer charge-offs remained low in this quarter at seven basis points. With net recoveries in Auto, Home Equity, RV and Marine, our NPA ratio declined 12% as portfolio has continued to perform as expected, and the ACL coverage of NPA increased to 247%. Finally, turning to our outlook on Slide 15. As we operate in a dynamic macro environment, we're focused on managing what we can control. We remain committed to investing in our people first digitally powered strategy, driving sustained revenue growth, while managing expenses within our long-term commitment to positive operating leverage and achieving a 70% return on tangible common equity. We expect a peer group leading efficiency ratio and a normalized effective tax rate of 18% to 19%. We believe these key metrics, revenue growth, return on capital and annual positive operating leverage are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders. Now, let me turn it back over to Tim so we can get to your questions. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, Zack. We will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow up. And then if that person has additional questions, they can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator, let's open up for questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. ScottSiefers: Good morning, guys. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Zack I was hoping maybe there might be a way to put sort of a finer point on the degree to which you might expect costs to come down in future quarters from this quarter's roughly $1.05 million core basics, of course y you mentioned the acceleration just trying to get a sense for sort of the core investment spending minus the cost saves. And then along the lines of acceleration, so when do we think that cost savings will be 100% baked into the results? ZachWasserman: Yes, thanks, Scott. Great question. Overall, as I noted in my prepared remarks, just really, really pleased with our delivery of the cost synergies and the trajectory. And I'm not going to give you specific guidance. But I would say that we do expect sequential reduction each quarter and for the next couple of quarters for that to be a larger amount, in the double digit millions is likely the level you could think about. But in the end, what I'd point you to is the overall expense guidance that I've given, which is net of the cost synergies and the investments that we're making to self fund those revenue synergy investments into generally drive revenue growth across the business. So slightly more front loaded driving sequential growth throughout the balance of the next five quarters. ScottSiefers: Perfect. Thank you and then maybe switching gears just a bit. And it's pretty constructive on overall lending momentum. I was curious if you could maybe, let us know sort of how that translates into aggregate, the sort of an aggregate outlook for ex-PPP loan growth. I think previously, you guys have been saying underlying loans kind of flattish through the remainder of the year, and then they grow thereafter. Does the more constructive tone suggest maybe we get a little more growth sooner? ZachWasserman: Yes, it's a great question. Let me elaborate a bit more. I think as we talked at the Barclays Investor Conference in September, I noted, I expect to see some modest growth between then and the end of Q3. And that's ultimately what we deliver and really pleased with that. I would characterize the growth we're expecting for Q4 as well to be modest. So we do expect growth, likely modest, I think, it's really driven by the continuation of the factors we've seen for the last several quarters. And we noted a bit in the prepared remarks, that is really strong calling activity and pipelines driving continued robustly production and commercial and, quite a bit of momentum in business banking, and then in the consumer space, continued strength in residential mortgage, and auto and RV marine continued to perform pretty well also. The other thing I would say is, now that we have the conversion behind us, that we've gotten, we're able to now focus 1000s of colleagues on growth. And so we do expect the modest growth as we go into Q4 and then continuing and frankly accelerating as we go on throughout the course of next year as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. EbrahimPoonawala: Good morning. First wanted to follow up on Zack on the expense question. So we talked about the core in terms of the, I guess, merger related or the notable items that you call out. When do you think those completely go away? Or does some of that stick around as we think about just the overall expense on that? ZachWasserman: Yes, great question, Ebrahim. I think Q4 should be remained relatively elevated. Similar to the levels we've seen, overall, taking a step back overall, our outlook for the merger related costs will be guided back in December at the time of the announcement was $890 million. And we continued to expect it to be relatively near that level. So I think the timing of that we've seen more than $500 million at this point through this quarter. And so we'll see a bit more come in Q4, and then likely a last bit in Q1, perhaps a tiny bit trailing into Q2, and then by the end of Q2, essentially it should be done. EbrahimPoonawala: Got it. And I guess just shifting to the to TCF integration sort of nearing an end, Steve, strategically, when you win an acquisitive bank, we are hearing some concerns around just the regulatory stance around deal making getting tough, just give us a sense of what your priorities are from capital deployment, is M&A still a piece of the puzzle in terms of how you think about growing the bank? SteveSteinour: Ebrahim, we've done two larger bank combinations in 12 years, so I not really think we're like the characterization is apt but beyond that, as we've said before, our focus is on driving the core performance. We think we have tremendous revenue upside here. We've got Greenfield opportunities for a number of businesses in Denver, and certainly the Twin Cities, we've got a scale that we've never had in Chicago. Frankly, we've got density in Michigan, that's significant to us. So we're very focused on driving revenue and getting the benefits of that part of the combination equation. We've done a few non bank things in the past, I'd say more likely over the next years, possibly to do some of that. But our focus, our entire focus is on driving the core. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. BillCarcache: Thank you. Good morning. Can you remind us how much relative gearing you have to the short versus long end of the curve? And how you think about performance in an environment where the short end rises perhaps a bit faster than the long end? ZachWasserman: Yes, we're most sensitive to the, first of all, thanks for your question, Bill, this is Zack, we are most sensitive to the two to four arrange within -- two to four year range within the yield curve to give you a sense. And, look, I think we're going to benefit here as rates move up, irrespective of the steepening but certainly we do, we'd appreciate it if that two to four range continue to move up, as it has been doing and as in our continued expectation, and we're positioning to benefit from that, as I noted in some of my preferred remarks, by driving incremental asset sensitivity, and to give you a sense that the average duration of our current delta hedging portfolio was one and a half years versus the almost five years for the duration of our pay fix swaps little bit of benefit as we start to rise. So I think we're positioned now in the quarter by more than a point of asset sensitivity, as I noted and we'll look to be dynamic to improve that even as we go forward. BillCarcache: Thanks Zack, that's super helpful. And following up on that, as you look ahead to higher short rates and better loan growth as utilization rates normalize, how comfortable are you with the rate at which you've been reducing the amount of liquidity that you have parked at the Fed? And then as we look ahead over the next few quarters, I guess, should we expect you to continue to grow the securities portfolio from your, just curious about the extent to which you consider preserving liquidity, through the rest of this year, based on -- just based on the outlook? ZachWasserman: Yes, it's a terrific question, and certainly something that we watch very, very carefully. I would say full stop, we feel great about our liquidity levels, and we think we're managing exceptionally well. But the cash -- the Fed is a key area that we watch very, very carefully. And so we're, I would say I would characterize our approaches is intentionally incremental, watching the behaviors in our clients and deposit holding activities and seeking to kind of optimize incrementally period by period as more information comes out, as we've guided for a couple of quarters now, we expected to add to the securities portfolio and I think in the last quarter, we mentioned a number $4 billion we completed that during the third quarter, we'll see where it goes from here. I do if liquidity trends continue, as we expect, I also expect that we will add some additional securities in the fourth quarter. We're currently at about 22% securities as a percentage of assets. And we'd be comfortable that rose modestly over time here, given the acceptable returns we're seeing and the fact that the accretive to NIM versus holding on cash, but as you noted that the priority is funding growth. And so we'll take a very much incremental approach watching both trends. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. KenZerbe: Hi, guys. Thanks. Good morning. In terms the core NIM, I know there is a bit of confusion around why your clients was or wasn't. If we did our math right, I think your core NIM just ex-PPP sorry, the PAA is about 2.81%, which is a fair bit lower than the 2.90%, though, that I think we were sort of shooting for. Can you just talk about two, I guess two things. So one, what drove sort of the weaker NIM ex the PAA, but also how do you think about that core NIM on a go forward basis? Thanks. ZachWasserman: Sure. Yes, thanks for the question, Ken. So fully reported NIM came into 2.90%. And excluding PAA as you know it was to 2.81%. So it was a few basis points lower than we expected, my prior guidance had been sort of just a few basis points lower than 2.90%. And it came in ultimately 2.81% so a bit lower than that. The two biggest drivers of that were the things we've just talked about in the last question actually interestingly, elevated Fed cash contributed several basis points additional drag in the quarter than we had previously expected. And we did accelerate the purchase of our securities, which also impacted the mix and drove yields lower generally, spreads was spot on our expectation overall, at a core loan level. Look, I think what I would tell you is going forward, I'm expecting stable from these levels, it'll be a function of what happens with the elevated liquidity and Fed cash and the rate environment, but generally stable from these levels is a fair assumption. And our key focus at this point is trying to drive net interest income dollars, that $1,085 million of net interest income, excluding DAA excluding PPP, given the sequential loan growth that we're projecting, given that rate stability my expectation is we're going to grow those dollars into Q4 and grow them throughout 2022. KenZerbe: Got it, okay, perfect. And then, just in terms of the 62 branch closures that you talked about, in first quarter, that's all wrapped up into your expense guidance. I just want to make sure that we're not -- we shouldn't take the expense guidance plus anything else? Because that's just part of the outlook, correct. ZachWasserman: You're spot on, Ken. So as Steve noted in his prepared remarks, we'll continue to optimize the network, dynamically manage expenses, ensure that we can invest to capture those really powerful revenue synergies, and overall, the guidance I gave on expenses is net of all those things. And ultimately, we're, what this is all driving toward is achieving our moderate term financial targets that we talked about over time the 17% return on capital, the revenue growth, accelerating positive operating leverage, needed to drive to that in the second half of '22. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. StevenAlexopoulos: Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up on Scott's initial question on loan growth. In your response, you guys sound pretty bullish on loan momentum, right? Steve, you talked about how much the commercial pipeline is up, Zack you talked about how momentum is building. Why are you not looking for stronger loan growth here in the fourth quarter? SteveSteinour: Steve, a great question. This is Steve. This is a funny quarter because of the holidays interrupting so we'll have very good asset finance origination, but we've had a substantial effort around the conversion. We've had 800 ambassadors out in our different business lines for a couple of weeks. We pulled in at sort of peak production moments, a lot of the talents of focus on making sure we got a great conversion, and we think we did. So it's harder to do new business between Thanksgiving and yearend, if it's not already in the pipeline. So we're talking about another three, three and a half, four weeks max, for the pipeline. Now the pipelines are up. As we indicated, they're up year-over-year; they're up quarter-over-quarter sequentially. So that's contributing to the bullishness. But it's an odd quarter to be driving it. We're very optimistic about what, how this will translate then for full year '22 as we go forward. We have some great capabilities that have come to us with TCF and we've already put in place, much of the management and a number of the RMs and other revenue producers that we are looking to do in the Twin Cities in Denver, and increasingly in Chicago. So the pieces are coming together very nicely and I have scheduled and that's also contributing to the optimism. StevenAlexopoulos: Okay, that's helpful. And, Steve, for my follow up. We all know Huntington scores really well, from a client satisfaction view. Did the brand's consolidations have a notable negative impact on satisfaction levels? And how long do you think it'll take to move TCF below peer client satisfaction up to Huntington's level? Thanks. SteveSteinour: Just the sheer amount of activity has required substantial efforts and resources during the course of the year. So we would expect to see a very modest decline in customer set. And frankly, it could -- we could be flat, but we wouldn't expect to see an increase. With respect to the TCF, the new branches from TCF and our colleagues who are new from TCF they are embracing fair play and the products that, what we saw during the conversion was just outstanding efforts with our customers. And so we're very encouraged, it will take maybe a couple of quarters, but it won't take a couple of years in order to get that customer service level added equivalency in those newer branches. We're very, very pleased. We got a great group of colleagues who have joined us from TCF. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. JohnPancari: Good morning. I know you've -- and given your expectations here you've indicated your expectation for continued positive operating leverage. How do you think about that for '2022? Maybe you can help us with a magnitude? I know you're not specifically guiding on the top line or the expense growth expectation, but maybe if you can help us with the magnitude of positive operating leverage on a core basis that you think are reasonable for next year. Thanks. ZachWasserman: Yes, John. Thanks for the question. And I think you noted in your question, and I will repeat to that, I'm not going to give you the specific guidance, but I will try to characterize to answer your question. I think next year's financials are going to be challenging to look at from a year-over-year growth perspective and to some degree to calculate that metric just given the continued two quarters of grow over impact of adding the TCF business but we do expect full year positive operating leverage in total. And the big thing that we're very focused on is driving to the point where the momentum coming into the second half of the year, and then certainly exiting the year is on the levels that we've targeted for those moderate on targets. And so at that point, as we sort of get into a clean year-over-year growth period to be able to see it better. And, look, it won't be dynamic, as we always have been to ensure that we can modulate the expenses, given where revenue is trending, while continue to invest in, my expectation is we'll see solid positive operating leverage, but not going to characterize the level specifically at this point. JohnPancari: Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then I guess sort of related question is on the medium term efficiency goal of 56%. Currently on an adjusted basis, you're 61 spot two and curious on how you're thinking about that glide path down to the 56%. What type of timing do you think is reasonable, updated, based upon updated trends in the business that you're seeing? When do you think you can hit the 56%? Thanks. ZachWasserman: Yes. Significantly, we are going to drive toward that I would note that the efficiency ratio is sort of an outcome, frankly. And the most important metrics are revenue growth, return on capital positive operating numbers that we're driving to. But efficiency is a key metric. And so we are watching it carefully. My expectation at this point is sort of during the second half of the year, we will see those emerge. We're still doing some of the budgeting to modulate the precision with respect to quarters, but certainly, I think by the second half of the year, and the exit run rate of Q4 is my expectation. JohnPancari: Second half of '22? ZachWasserman: Correct. -- '21, I misspoke. Operator : Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. TerryMcEvoy: Hi, thanks. Good morning. TCF had about a two plus billion dollar inventory finance portfolio. I'm curious, where is that portfolio today. And then the auto dealer floor plan balances at Huntington kind of pre COVID versus today. And what I'm getting at is what's the upside of the balance sheet when inventories in both of those portfolios hypothetically normalize? ZachWasserman: Yes, I think as we've talked about a bit over time. Interestingly, each of the three major kinds of line businesses that we've got auto inventory and general motor market, each of them represented roughly $2 billion opportunities, when those utilization rates return to normalize pre-COVID levels. So that sort of gives you an order of magnitude, the trends we're seeing at this point in auto, we're down a couple more percentage points of three to be precise between the end of Q2, and the end of Q3 to 25%. At this point, I'm seeing relative stability in the auto floor plan business, to some degree, some of the chip issues and other supply change issues produce some incremental pressure, we're also getting some defined and no new commitments and some term debt into those businesses such that my expectation is relatively flat in that space. And interestingly, inventory finance has similar opportunities or creating some very known plan uses of those lines, so expects stability, perhaps even a modest uptick, actually into Q4 and that the general rental market should continue to be flat here for the time being, however, I am going to answer your question, but I would pulling back a second, I would just highlight that it's our planning expectation at this point, that the totality of these lines will be relatively flat throughout the course of '22. There could well be an opportunity to get to that. But at this point, for planning purposes, we're trying to zero that out. But we still expect pretty good loan growth. And I think that's really just pointing back to the robust new production activity that we're seeing. So this could be ultimately the tailwind and we do expect over time it will be and the headwind nature, as largely moderated that's why we expected general to flat. TerryMcEvoy: Thank you. And then as a follow up the $140 million of service charges on the TCF part. Were the fee adjustments made right after the conversion? I remember there were some revisions that we're going to made that would result in lower fees. And I'm just looking at that run rate and asking if that's sustainable going forward. ZachWasserman: Yes, it's a great question. And upon conversion that we completed over the Columbus Day weekend all the TCF customers are now on to the Huntington products, the platform and all of our fair play product dynamics. And so we will expect to see a modestly lower trajectory for that line into Q4. Overall, over the longer term, we feel great about the conversion to the fair play business as we've talked about a lot. And this is a play we have run many times and we're very confident in the returns that are generated. Typically, the dynamic is sort of a higher degree of fee, income reduction in the early periods, offset over time by incremental deepening and incremental acquisition in the market from those products, generally about an 18 month payback. And so sort of the dynamic we're expecting to see a bit lower into Q4 and then climb back and paying back over that kind of roughly a year and a half period. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. JonArfstrom: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just back on a loan growth topic you highlighted the late stage, middle market up 36%. And just curious what you think is behind that and how much things have changed over the last couple of quarters. And then, Steve or Rich, any feedback on the supply chain loosening up from your borrowers. SteveSteinour: John, I'll start this, this is Steve, Rich and Zack may choose to add but the supply chain issues continue to be a challenge, you're seeing some OEMs ship and deliver without chips. Even some of the autos are doing that. But we've got auto dealers with no new inventory allot. It's shocking. To illustrate the challenges here. And as I think you saw with the Ford and GM earnings announcements, expectations that are going to go deepen in the next year before it gets normalized. So that's why Zach's earlier comment is we're not counting on utilization, normalization in inventory, finance or auto to be a tailwind next year. If it happens, that's great. Now, we do see supply chain issues getting resolved or getting to a resolution over time. And would expect that to continue, again through next year, maybe even a little bit beyond depending on the industry. But there's a lot of activity and footprint about fueling and additional manufacturing capabilities with adjacency in North America, including in the footprint states that we're in. So we like how this sets up over time in terms of additional opportunity for us and we're bullish, but we clearly have both a supply chain and a labor issue in virtually every business that's out there today. RichPohle: Hi, Steve, this is Rich, rich, maybe just to piggyback on that, I think, as it relates to middle market low demand, we're seeing that a couple places that Steve mentioned, increased CapEx given the labor issues, I think there is a bigger push to automate production to garner that productivity that will offset some of the labor issues. The other thing that we're seeing is just a heightened level of M&A. I think as we're coming out of kind of the COVID fog here with respect to EBITDA levels and things, there's just a greater sense of certainty around cash flows, and I think buyers are aggressively looking to expand if they can, and sellers, I think some of them have just gotten a little tired, kind of going through a COVID environment and when their cash flows are picking back up a position where maybe they want to sell. And so we are seeing increased M&A in the middle market space as well. There's also, Jon, a dynamic in the Twin Cities in Denver, TCF did not have their market banking. There were a series of things they just didn't do. So these are Greenfield every customer's net new. And that's the teams are in places, as earlier mentioned, and we'll be building them out further, but we've got four in place, we're seeing success, and that's translating into additional cross sell revenue as well. And that's contributing to this optimism. JonArfstrom: I'm guessing SBA falls in that as well. Is that fair? ZachWasserman: Yes, it does. JonArfstrom: Okay and then can you just touch on your repurchase appetite from here? ZachWasserman: Yes. This is Zack. I'll take that one, Jon. I think we're being pretty dynamic on it. We had a very intentional plan going into the third quarter, as we noted in the July call to accelerate in front load. And we felt great about the $500 million; I think we're going to likely continue to be somewhat front loaded with a balance of that here in Q4 and as we go into Q1, but still working through it. And I think, looking to be dynamic as we do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. KenUsdin: Thanks. Good morning. Zack, I was just wondering, in the third quarter, did you have some gross savings in there? Or and can you tell us what they were? I know you're only kind of telling us we're going to decline from here, but just wondering what you might have already captured? ZachWasserman: Yes, I would say they were quite modest in the third quarter. I think if you think about the cost savings, they came largely from ultimately branch rationalization, employee level of reductions, technology, synergies importing the TCF business essentially onto the Huntington tech stack. And that's sort of a long tail of other savings, including a number of vendor and sourcing related opportunities that come with some increased scale and for the most part, most of those really were beginning to be executed on during the third quarter with sort of effect more into the fourth. And as we go into the first quarter, the decisions around them and the planning and actions necessary to achieve them have essentially all been completed. And now we're in the execution mode of just realizing them. So not much, I guess is the long winded answer in the third quarter, more substantively, the fourth quarter, which is partially why we're talking about sort of a larger step down in the fourth quarter than we thought before. And then if we go into the first quarter, so yet again, a similar level of step down is my current expectation, then a bit of a more of an asymptotic function, as you get into Q3, and Q4, but still stepping down. KenUsdin: And a follow up on that. Do you have any change to your view of the original 490 in total that you expect? I know you're telling us to maybe we see a little bit more of a pull forward from a timing perspective. But what about the absolute amount? SteveSteinour: No, I mean the absolute amount is solid at that level. And we're kind of within rounding errors higher than that. So nothing overly substantive that I would call out, I pointed to for nine years. That's the number Huntington achieve and it's got -- KenUsdin: Okay. And last cleanup one, just PPP in the deck, you show that you have $54 million of the fees left. How do you expect the NII related to PPP to traject from here fourth quarter and beyond on the 40 something? ZachWasserman: It's kind of like a half life function; I would tell you over the next three quarters, we're expecting roughly 50% of the PPP to reduce into the fourth quarter. And then roughly 50% of that reducing into the first and then yet again into the second. These are planning assumptions I've given you, you should -- we should note that it's pretty dynamic. And the SBA to their credit has been accelerating forgiveness quite substantively recently. And so these numbers move around from a planning perspective, that's essentially the kind of outlook function that we've got. Operator : Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. DavidLong: Good morning, everyone. Just I wanted to drill down on the service charge and deposits here and a good quarter for my think expectations. And when, Steve, when you look at the press the headlines that it gets talked about a lot, that there's going to be some restrictions on overdraft and just curious how you're thinking about that, and how that may impact your fees going forward. And then secondly, when I think of the overdraft side of things, fair play banking, something that you guys have, I think your overdraft fees would be a smaller portion of revenue to peers, but yes your screen a little bit higher there. Just curious as to why you think that may be the case as well. Thanks. SteveSteinour: David, great questions, we put 24 hour  more than a decade ago. And that continues to this day, we opened it up last year for small business. And we're continuing to do certain things to help our customers stand by cash is a classic example of that. There's no limit to the use of that, those funds with our customers, we put up a minimum of $50 in last year for an overdraft, and we call that safety zone. So we have been continuously over time working to benefit our customers as part of this fair play banking philosophy. We tend to be very strong on a relative basis in terms of customer acquisition as a constant quench of the different features and functions on our checking products. And that's ameliorated both the revenue give up over the last decade or so, very, very substantially. As Zack pointed out, they'll be a bit of a step down in the fourth quarter and for a couple of quarters thereafter for the TCF customers, but they're going to get the same advantage of products and services that all of our previously existing customers have as well. So and it will accompany our expectation around both customer retention and customer acquisition. It's hard to, it's -- I can't speculate unlike regulators they do. But we've, again, we've been trying to do things help consumers and businesses for quite some time. Not just with overdraft fees, but other types of fee elimination reductions, those requirements, we've put a new alert system in that regard, a year and a half ago. So there are a lot of tools available to help customer manage their money, budget, et cetera and avoid overdraft fees. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : So thank you for joining us today. We've completed the majority of the actions leading to achievement of TCF cost synergies and expect to achieve all of the planned reductions. We're coming off the diversion with significant momentum across the bank and I'm confident that our disciplined execution will create substantial value for our shareholders. We have a deeply embedded stock ownership mentality which aligns the interests of our board, management and colleagues, with our shareholders. So appreciate your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call today. Let me begin on Slide 3. 2021 was a transformational year for Huntington. We continue to live our purpose and remain focused on our vision to become the country's leading people first digitally powered bank. We executed on our organic growth initiatives along with a timely closing of the TCF acquisition. In the fourth quarter, we began by successfully completing conversion activities. And by the time we exited the quarter, we'd refocused our teams on driving growth. We delivered record new loan production and continued to build on revenue initiatives. We entered '22 with added scale, density, new markets and specialty businesses. We are intently focused on driving growth and delivering top tier financial performance. On Slide 4, we're pleased to report our excellent fourth quarter results centered on four key areas. First, we finished '21 with record full year revenue growth and broad-based loan production. We delivered strong performance across the board in our commercial businesses. Second, our targeted cost savings are on track for full realization. This includes both the synergies resulting from TCF as well as the additional expense actions we announced last quarter. Third, we are executing on key initiatives to deliver sustainable growth. Pipelines are robust entering '22 and our teams are focused on driving revenue growth, including the revenue synergy initiatives related to our new markets, and capabilities. Finally, we are very confident in our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Slide 5 recaps our year-end review. Our financial results reflect the hard work of our teams over the course of '21. Return on tangible common equity came in at 19% excluding notable items. Credit performed very well, and we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We delivered robust organic growth in both consumer and business checking households with year-over-year growth of 4.5% and 7%, respectively. We continue to invest in revenue producing colleagues and initiatives, including new and expanded commercial banking verticals, capital markets, cards and payments and wealth management. In the commercial bank, we launched EDGE, an innovative analytics tool that supports our bankers deepening efforts incorporating advanced data and insights tailored to each customer. In consumer banking, we build upon our Fair Play approach and launched new and compelling products and services, such as Standby Cash and Early Pay. We expanded our leading SBA lending program to new states as well as added to our practice finance capabilities. We were honored to be recognized for our expertise evidenced by being ranked number one by J.D. Power for both customer satisfaction within our region, as well as the top consumer mobile app amongst regional banks for the third consecutive year. Impressively, this was all achieved while our team successfully completed the closing and conversion of TCF. On the capital front, we were pleased to accelerate our share repurchase program as well as increase the common stock dividend. In closing, our teams accomplished a tremendous amount of work over the course of the year, and I want to thank all of our colleagues and our management team who supported these efforts. I am increasingly bullish on the year ahead. The level of excitement is building across the organization and our colleagues are energized and focused. We look forward to sharing our successes with all of you as we move throughout the year. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.26. Adjusted for notable items, earnings per common share were $0.36. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in at 13.2% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 18.2%. We were pleased to see loan balances rebound substantially during the quarter driven by robust new production activity, as total loans increased by $1.4 billion and including PPP runoff loans increased by $2.4 million. Consistent with our plan, we reduced core expenses excluding notable items by $21 million from last quarter, driven by the realization of cost synergies and ongoing highly disciplined expense management. We manage absolute core expense dollars lower, while continuing to grow investments in strategic areas across the bank, such as digital capabilities, marketing to drive new customer acquisition, and relationship deepening and select new personnel additions to support our revenue growth initiatives. Within fee income categories, we saw continued momentum in our capital markets as well as wealth and investment businesses. Strong credit performance continued to be a hallmark with net charge-offs of 12 basis points and non-performing assets declining by 16% from the prior quarter. We actively managed our capital base, repurchasing $150 million of common stock in the fourth quarter. To date, we have completed $650 million of our $800 million share repurchase program. Turning to Slide 7. Period end loan balances increased by 1.2% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $111.9 billion. Total loan balances excluding PPP increased $2.4 billion or 2.2% during the quarter, driven by commercial loans. Within commercial, excluding PPP, loans increased by $2.5 billion or 4.4% compared to the prior quarter. This growth was broad-based across all major portfolios, and was driven by record new commercial loan production. Growth was led by middle market, corporate and specialty banking, which increased by $1 billion and represented 40% of total commercial loan growth this quarter. Inventory finance increased by $597 million; auto dealer floorplan increased by $276 million; asset finance increased by $160 million; and commercial real estate increased by $267 million. Within corporate and specialty banking, each of our commercial verticals contributed to growth this quarter, including corporate banking, tech and telecom, health care and franchise. Inventory finance growth was driven by a combination of seasonally higher balances due to inventory shipments in the quarter as well as expansion of existing customer programs. Higher utilization levels drove approximately two-thirds of the increased balances. In auto floorplan, we are continuing to add new dealer relationships and growing our overall commitment levels. In addition, balance has benefited from improved utilization rates, which increased from the mid-20s to approximately 30% in the quarter. Even as we delivered record loan production, calling activities across the business continued at a rapid pace. We ended the quarter with commercial loan pipelines 34% higher versus the prior quarter and 49% higher than prior year, supporting our outlook for continued loan growth ex PPP throughout 2022. On the consumer side, residential mortgage increased by $334 million and auto increased by $129 million. This was offset by home equity, which declined by $369 million. Turning to Slide 8, deposit balances increased by $1.4 billion as we continue to experience elevated customer liquidity and optimize our funding, reducing CD balances by over $700 million. Consumer deposit balances increased by $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. Commercial balances increased by $300 million from the prior quarter. On Slide 9, reported net interest income declined modestly from the prior quarter as a result of lower PPP revenue. Core net interest income excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion was stable at $1.085 billion. With ending loan balances well above average balances for the quarter, we enter the first quarter of 2022 with a solid launch point from which to grow core net interest income going forward. Additionally, we continue to manage excess liquidity by funding loan growth and adding to the securities portfolio, reducing excess cash with the Fed to $3.7 billion from $8.1 billion at prior quarter end. On an average basis for the quarter, excess liquidity represented a drag on margin of approximately 14 basis points. Turning to Slide 10, we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to increase asset sensitivity and provide downside protection. During the fourth quarter, we added $2.8 billion of securities, and we continue to optimize our hedging program. We terminated $3.9 billion of received fixed swaps and floors and we entered into new pay fixed swaps in order to bolster our asset sensitivity. As rates move higher, we opportunistically added $5 billion of received fixed swaps in order to manage downside risks. At year-end, our modeled net interest income asset sensitivity in an up 100 basis points scenario was 4.6%. We have steadily increased this metric over the past 18 months, supporting our ability to continue to capture upside opportunity as interest rates increase. Moving to Slide 11, non-interest income was $515 million, up $106 million year-over-year and down $20 million from last quarter. Lower fee revenues in the fourth quarter were driven by a decline in mortgage banking, primarily as a result of lower saleable spreads. Our targeted focused on growing strategic fee revenue streams continue to bear fruit with capital market fees up $7 million or 18% from the prior quarter. Wealth and investments and insurance also performed quite well. Card and payments revenues, which are typically seasonally flat from Q3 to Q4 declined slightly from the prior quarter impacted at the margin by ATM volumes and the debit card conversion for TCF customers during the month of October. The underlying core business activity in cards and payments continues to be very solid. And we saw a restoration of ongoing growth in that business as the quarter progressed after conversion. Deposit service charges declined $13 million compared to the prior quarter as a result of TCF customers transitioning onto the Huntington Fair Play product set. Moving on to Slide 12, non-interest expense declined $68 million from the prior quarter. And excluding notable items, core expenses declined by $21 million to $1.034 billion as we captured cost savings from the acquisition and exercise discipline expense management. As we shared previously, we expect our core expenses to trend down in the first and second quarters, fairly ratably over that period to approximately $1 billion on the second quarter. Even as we work to bring down expense levels, we're continuing to invest in initiatives that will drive sustainable revenue growth, while being disciplined and managing our overall expense base. As you saw last quarter, we took additional actions in order to free up capacity to support these investments, while remaining committed to the absolute core expense declines in the near-term. Over the longer term, we expect expense growth to be a function of revenue growth as we manage within our commitment to positive operating leverage. Slide 13 highlights our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.3%, consistent with our prior guidance to operate within the lower half of our 9% to 10% operating guideline. We have $150 million remaining of our current share repurchase program. As you can see on Slide 14, credit quality continues to perform well. Net charge-offs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our non-performing assets declined 16% from the previous quarter. Our ending allowance for credit losses represented 1.88% of total loans down from 1.99% at prior quarter end. The improving economic outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a reserve release of $98 million in the fourth quarter. Slide 15 covers our medium-term financial goals. We are focused on driving sustained revenue growth, while managing expenses within our long-term commitment to positive operating leverage and achieving a 17% plus return on tangible common equity. We expect to begin seeing this performance in the second half of 2022. Finally, turning to Slide 16, let me share a couple thoughts on our expectations for 2022. Our outlook is based on the starting point of our most recent quarterly results with expectations for year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter of 2022. It also assumes continued economic expansion aligned to market consensus as well as interest rate yield curve expectations as of early January. We expect average loan growth, ex PPP to be up high single digits based on our starting point of $107.9 billion. As a result of loan growth and modestly higher net interest margin, we expect core net interest income on a dollar basis, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion to grow in the high single-digit to low double digits range. Fee revenues are expected to be up low single digits, driven by robust growth in key categories aligned to our strategies, including capital markets, our card and treasury management payments businesses, and wealth and advisory with offsetting impact from lower year-over-year revenues in mortgage banking, and the continued evolution of our Fair Play products. As mentioned, we expect to continue to drive sequential reduction in core expenses for the next several quarters, as we fully realize the TCF cost synergies and benefit from broader expense management. At the same time, we are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives and new revenue synergy opportunities. We expect the quarterly run rate of core expenses to be approximately $1 billion by the second quarter, and then remaining relatively stable over the second half of the year from that level. In closing, we're keenly focused on the revenue opportunities ahead of us. We have the teams directed toward these key initiatives and we're confident in our 2022 outlook to deliver on this plan. We believe these drivers of our outlook are aligned with our goals for sustained revenue growth, a 17% plus return on tangible common equity, and our commitment to annual positive operating leverage. Now, let me pass it back to Steve for a couple closing comments before we open up for Q&A. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Zach. Slide 17 summarizes what we believe is a compelling opportunity. Huntington stands as a powerful top 10 regional bank with scale and leading market density as well as a compelling set of capabilities, both in footprint and nationally. We're focused on driving sustainable revenue growth, which is bolstered by new markets and new businesses. This growth opportunity augments our underlying businesses in many cases where we have top 10 market positions. As a result of these factors, we've demonstrated robust financial performance that we expect to further improve as we move throughout '22. We believe our return on capital will be in the top tier versus peers, which results in substantial value creation for shareholders. Tim, let's open up the call for Q&A. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Steve. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. And our first question today is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Ebrahim. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe just wanted to follow-up around the expense guidance. Zach, you mentioned about a billion dollars flatlining in the back half. But just give us a little bit of puts and takes in terms of where the savings are coming right now. I'm sure much like everyone else, you're investing in the franchise. So, if you don't mind giving us a lens of like how we should think about a little bit of a medium-term expense growth outlook, or are there saving opportunities at the bank where expenses could be around these levels for more than just 2022? Zach Wasserman : Yes, thanks for the question. I think it\u2019s an area of important focus for us as well. Just taking a step back, really pleased with the trajectory that we're on here. As we've talked about for a while, we're committed to take our expenses from the high watermark in Q3 of '21 at $1.055 billion down to that $1 billion over a three-quarter period. And we saw the first step guide in Q4 of $21 million. We expect to see the remaining fairly ratably in Q1 and Q2 and then fairly steady for the balance of '22. I think as you get beyond '22 and out into the future, the way we're looking at it is to manage within the confines of our commitment to positive operating leverage, just as we have for the 8 of last 9 years. Given our revenue growth trajectory and what we expect to be pretty solid and sustained revenue growth, that'll provide the capacity to maintain expenses within that level and still invest back in the business. And clearly there will be plenty of opportunities as we go forward to continue to drive scale, efficiencies, process improvement, automation in lots of ways to drive efficiencies that will allow us to plow back investments into the key initiatives, while still achieving that positive operating leverage. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just as a follow-up, as part of the loan growth guidance, if you could remind us, it means TCF obviously had a bunch of businesses that are levered towards CapEx and inventory rebuilds, both in auto dealer and outside of that, how much of that is baked into this loan growth guidance? And what's the potential for loan growth actually exceeding expectations that you outlined? Zach Wasserman : Yes, so the guidance as we as we talked about was high single digits for loan growth. Overall, it will be driven by production. I think it will look pretty similar to what we saw in Q4. That is commercial-led, driven by production and really supported by what we are seeing from our customers and just really robust pipeline and calling activities at this point. And it's across all the commercial sectors, including those that we've now incorporated in TCF middle market corporate banking, especially verticals, but also really important contributors from the inventory finance business, the vendor and asset finance business that we had picked up from TCF as well. In addition, I would point out, continued contribution from the consumer side as well. We are expecting sustained growth in resi on sheet. Auto, RV/Marine and also likely benefiting there from your lower prepays as we go forward. We have assumed a modest contribution from utilization improvement during the year and that will contribute to some degree. But I would note that $5 billion of line utilization below pre-pandemic levels is just a massive coiled spring that will enable us to fuel growth. It will likely some in the back half of '22, much more as we go out into the future into '23 and beyond. Ebrahim Poonawala : Helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start by maybe drilling down a little into the margin. Zach, maybe sort of your best thoughts on how you see the margin trajecting throughout the year. I guess maybe the best starting point is probably the adjusted 2.78 margin. And to the extent that you're comfortable, any thoughts on your sort of your best estimate for how much benefit you would get from each Fed rate hike? Zach Wasserman : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. The guidance implies stable to slightly higher. And that's my expectation to continue to kind of trend ratably higher fare  as we go forward. And I think the dynamic that we'll see is very similar to what we've been talking about for a while. We'll see a slow roll off of our previous preexisting hedging program. But that'll be offset by benefits in reductions in the level of excess liquidity and the drag on margin that represents we talked about 14 basis point drag in Q4. We said we do expect a lot of that to run off, not all of it to run off during 2022, which will be a benefit. And then in the rate environment, which to the point of your question is somewhat uncertain, just given where the expectations rate hikes are at this point, excuse me, in the forward yield curve. But I do expect that to be a positive contributor as we go forward here. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect and just sort to be clear, I think in your prepared remarks, you noted that the NII guide was based on early January market expectations. So, does that embed then three Fed rate hikes into the guidance? Zach Wasserman : Yes, correct. So, the planning and budgeting that we completed was based on the early January rate curve that had three rate hikes in it. Over the last few weeks, clearly the curve has moved and sort of roughly pulled about a month forward had previously been the trajectory around the forward yield curve such that now there's, I think, a fourth hike now forecasted in the very last period in the year. That should be helpful for our q4 Guidance, but I would point you back to the guidance as slightly being in terms of the key range there inclusive of that. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right, thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning, everybody. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : I wanted to start -- so the net interest income outlook for 2022 has a pretty wide range, low -- high single-digit to low double-digit. Can you walk through because you're basing it on the forward curve? So, what is the swing factor that will take you either to the low end of that range or high end of that range? Steve Steinour : Yes, I would say it's mainly driven by where we end on asset growth. The more asset growth we have, the more kind of incremental NII lift we will have on a growth basis, just given the fact that the yield will be stable to up. And so that's the big driver there I think as well. Just further to the last question, where the rate curve ends up going throughout the course of the year, it's clearly been somewhat volatile here over the last several months. At the -- where it\u2019s at now, I think our guidance stands and those are the dynamics that drive the range within it. Zach Wasserman : We're  within the range of somewhat. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Guys, so if average loans come out up high single digits, you'd be somewhere on the midpoint? Is that safe to assume of the NII guide? Zach Wasserman : Correct. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Thanks. And then on expenses, you guys seem to be one of the few banks not lifting the expense outlook given all this talk on inflation. Are you just not seeing as much wage pressure and inflation in your footprint? Are you just finding more offsets that others aren't finding? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Look, I think we're clearly seeing some indicators of inflation within the business, I would -- most notably hiring new talent and just starting the compensation expectations from our top talent. And I know when we talk to our clients, particularly those that are in commodity intensive businesses or labor-intensive businesses, they're feeling it having to adjust to manage it. At this point, the direct impacts on our expense space have been relatively limited. And we anticipate some wage inflation as we're going into the year trying to get ahead of it. Took a series of actions around compensation, we announced an increased or minimum wage across the company to $19 an hour from what had previously been $17. We made a number of other health priority adjustments. And so, we think we've got it box now in the 2022 plan included in our guidance. Lastly, I guess I would close, I think there's a unique point in time that we have perhaps some others don't, where we've got the benefits of scale coming from the TCF acquisition. Both the cost synergies that we've already defined and are executing against, but over the long-term we see more opportunities to continue to refine it and get scale efficiency. So that also I think contributes to helping us to maintain that really solid expense growth less revenue. Steve Steinour : Steven, just add on, we took some actions in the third quarter, and that includes 62 branch consolidations, that will happen in early February. And we took some other management, what we\u2019ve stylized as organization issues as well. So, we anticipated some level of inflation coming into the year. We try to get ahead of it with those actions taken in the third quarter. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Very good. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Steve Steinour : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning. I was wondering, Zack, in the outlook for NII, you talked about the loan growth side. I was just wondering if you could fill that in and tell us how you're thinking about both the growth and mix on the deposit side? Zach Wasserman : Yes. I do expect to see deposit growth begin to accelerate here. And I think it will be a pretty balanced mix between consumer and commercial as we go forward. For the last several quarters, we've been putting a sort of smaller emphasis on that, just came out strong. Liquidity has been throughout the system and the teams are repivoting back to drive that growth. And so that'll be a good balance to fund than what we expect to be, as I noted, accelerated loan growth throughout the year. Ken Usdin : Right. That's why I was just wondering, are you expecting earning assets to still grow? Or is it more about remixing the left side of the balance sheet? Zach Wasserman : Look, I think we'll see a bit of incremental growth in the securities portfolio, we're watching the elevated liquidity situation pretty closely. And same playbook, we've been operating with the last several quarters, just taking an incremental view, month-by-month looking at where that trend is and optimizing to see if there's -- if it's appropriate add additional securities. But I do think there's some remixing as we see loan growth start to accelerate to hit the high single-digit guidance that we've given. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. And the -- just -- can you tell us in your fee guide, what you're using in terms of the Fair Play impact and outlook on overdrafts and related fees? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Sure. Yes, let's talk about that. Steve Steinour : Yes, let me start. We introduced Fair Play 12 years ago, brought out 24-hour Grace and Asterisk-Free Checking. We've been doing things almost every year. 2014, we noticed all the deposits, but more recently and in '20, we put the safety zone and $50 minimal that we took 24-hour Grace to our business customers, because of the pandemic and the impact on small businesses and we felt that was the right time and thing to do to help those businesses at that point in time. But last year, we came forward with Standby Cash and Early Pay. And obviously, we've rolled all that out effective with the conversion to the TCF customers. So, we've pointed out an expected drag of that. Now we also -- we backed ourselves into a leadership position, I think for more than the last decade in this area. It's added to our brand value, our customer household growth, our relationship retention and expansion and significant deepening across product. So that is added to our brand and our loyalty and I think as we go forward, we will still retain this leadership role. There are plans we have in place going back now a number of months to do some more, looking out for our customers with Fair Play obviously with what the industry is doing and pivot in the last month or so. We're watching that closely and we would expect to react to that and will communicate more going forward. But Zacks guidance range includes what we're contemplating as we move forward this year in Fair Play and other fees. Maybe Zach you can just embellish the guidance, if you will . Zach Wasserman : Yes, let me tack on to what the comments Steve just made. When we construct these product changes, we think about the economics holistically. There are fees that we see on a gross basis, like overdraft. But there are also a lot of other levers in the consumer checking product economics, like other related account fees, other product features. And over time really importantly, the impact of that market leadership position has on elevated acquisition, that kind of retention and the relationship deepening that we can drive. And so, to be clear, included in my guidance on the overall fee line is the assumption of a net fee reduction of approximately $16 million in Q4 from these changes. I would expect them to be in place by the middle of the year. I would highlight that notwithstanding that impact, we do expect to see continued growth on the overall fee line as indicated by my guidance and low single digits driven by those strategic categories, cap markets payments, wealth and advisory. In addition to the fee impacts from the changes we're anticipating in our consumer products, we also expect to see a reduction of between $3 million and $5 million per quarter in charge-offs as the lower overdraft fees that we charge on a gross basis create just fewer incidences of uncollectible fees and it has lower charge-offs. Just taking a step back maybe kind of concluding on this discussion, we really believe that the positioning of our products is critical. And as we maintain that market leadership, this is a play we've run many times before. And the benefits we see in acquisition, retention and deepening as we maintain that leadership, we would expect to earn back that run rate fee loss in approximately 18 to 24 months, very much consistent with what we've seen in the past. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Arfstrom : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve Steinour : Hey, Jon. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. Jon Arfstrom : Question for you guys, obviously the expense gains and the revenue gains looks pretty good. There's one piece of it we haven't tackled and that's provisions. And just curious how you feel about credit and risk you still have fairly high reserves relative to peers. I know some of that's accounting, but with the lower loss expectations, and Zack, what you just said as well in charge-offs, can you help us think through the provision expectations? Rich Pohle : Yes, I mean, this is Rich, let me take that. We feel very good about the condition of the portfolio right now. The charge-offs for the year and the reduction in the NPA is both notable and both very positive. As it relates to the provision and the allowance, we have always been on the conservative side of the allowance. We started CECL day one on the high end and we've been very conservative on the way up, and I think very prudent on the way down. And we'll continue that way. And there's things that we're looking at in the economy as it relates to supply chain and labor, that type of thing. And just the continuing impacts of COVID that are just giving us pause as it relates to where we set the allowance, but it's a very disciplined process that we go through every quarter. We've had five consecutive reductions in the ACL ratio since we peaked in the third quarter of 2020. And we'll look at it every quarter as we always do with a very disciplined approach. And if this supply chain ease, conditions ease and labor conditions start to improve. I would expect that w will have continued reductions over time. Steve Steinour : Jon, our outlook is for reductions during '22 and charge-offs below the historic range. And we ended the year with very, very good credit quality and very pleased with performance of the portfolio that came up with TCF. So, loans have been regraded. So, there's consistency now, as of end of year. And the economic outlook plus what we see in the customer base is it gives us a lot of optimism as we go forward on the provision line. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. That helps. And then just as a follow-up, Steve, maybe more of a medium-term view on credit. It seems like you obviously have strong growth, and I know you're a risk person by nature, but the entire industry has strong growth expectations as well. Curious how long you think this all lasts without any real concerns on credit? Thanks. Steve Steinour : My current belief, Jon, is that we are going to go through '24 with a fairly robust GDP growth and performance on credit. And there's just an enormous amount of stimulus that's been enacted thus far. And some of it is multiyear, where the economy has performed well, but it's been labor constrained. As that sorts out, I think that puts longer legs into the growth. The supply chain issues that we face that are constraining production did constrain at '21, we will do so for much of '22, if not all the year, we'll get updated over time. We think things will get better a bit in the second half. But in some of these industries, '23 will become a more normal year. So those factors and others give us confidence that we've got a multiyear positive slope on loan growth and GDP and underlying credit quality. Now Rich will remain disciplined. We published the quarterly results for consumer and there's literally no variance over the last decade plus. So, we're quite confident of our capabilities to manage the risks at these levels. We're very pleased with the additional talent we gathered from TCF both in the origination side and in credit areas as we think about future. So, '25 or beyond would be where we're a little more concerned that we will be over the next few years. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks a lot, Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Jon. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Winter : Good morning, Zack. Good morning. Zach, I wanted to follow-up on Ken's questions just with regards to the outlook for service charges on deposit with the Fair Play. It was down $13 million this quarter. Can you just go through what the outlook is from fourth quarter levels just with the puts and takes that you talked about, again? Zach Wasserman : Sure. Absolutely. Good question. We converted the TCF customers on the second week of October. So, we had almost the entire quarter's worth of run rate of the TCF customers on to the Fair Play product in Q4. There might be a very marginal incremental impact into Q1. But for the most part, we're kind of at the new level trending. And as we said, we're continuing to roll out new product changes frankly of the same kind of nature that we\u2019ve been doing across the last 10 years, but we do expect to respond to what's happening and to do that by the middle of this year. And that will drive the roughly $16 billion incremental quarterly run rate reduction in fees on a net basis by Q4, just to be clear in the guidance. So those are the kind of puts and takes here at kind of a relatively flat level and then we will see those new changes come into place midyear with that roughly $16 million quarterly reduction in Q4. Peter Winter : Got it. Got it. And that's helpful. And then just, I was wondering, could you just give an update on revenue synergies from TCF, where you're seeing the biggest opportunities and what's happening in some of the newer markets? And if I think back to the FirstMerit deal, I think it was about $100 million in revenue synergies. I'm just wondering if maybe you could quantify what the impact could be with TCF. Zach Wasserman : Yes, we are really, really pleased with where they're going. I mean, we talked about this a little bit in multiple conferences, but there are four or five big buckets of them, the -- expanding our corporate business in the middle market, the corporate base and specialty businesses into the major commercial hubs within the formerly TCF geographic footprint like expanding in Chicago, expanding in Detroit. Denver is brand new. Minneapolis and St. Paul, brand-new to Huntington. And so that's a big one. Bringing the consumer product set to the TCF customers, we're seeing the second major bucket and we're seeing terrific early signs of engagement and how folks are reacting to not only the product set, but the digital channels and capabilities. Third, expanding our business banking and market-leading SBA production into the TCF geographies and we're well underway hiring out those teams and beginning to get early traction. Wealth management and private banking is an enormous fourth opportunity for us and we've already begun to build out very significant teams, for example, in Minneapolis, Twin Cities and in Denver. And then lastly, just leveraging the really now quite sizable scale equipment and inventory finance business, combining what we had before and then the great businesses that we brought over from TCF. So those are the five big buckets and we're seeing good traction and wins already. We haven't given a precise guidance on that in the past, I'm not ready to do that today, but it's already contributing to the growth outlook and helping us to drive the kind of acceleration that we expect to see in both fees and loans in 2022. And as we go forward, we will continue to provide more and more color on that as those continue to develop. Steve Steinour : Zach, if I could add, the capital markets fee income lift in the fourth quarter was at least in part related to the combination of TCF. So middle market banking didn't exist in Chicago or the Twin Cities or Denver for TCF. The broker-dealer was outsourced. And we talked about wealth. It's just that there are a number of product categories and capabilities that we have that we will be bringing into these expanded markets. And then in the context of the things that TCF did incredibly well, asset finance, inventory finance, et cetera, we have now the ability to cross-sell into that customer base, which historically was not done. So, on the consumer side, 1.5 million consumers that we've a much more robust product venue set that we will be offering and we are a multiple on home equity and again, which was not offered in a branch delivery system by TCF as well as mortgage. So excited across the board. We think we have a lot of consumer and business opportunities on the cross-sell side. Peter Winter : That's great. Thanks, Steve. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. I just had a few cleanup questions on NII sensitivity. But Steve, I thought it was very interesting when a large bank kicked off earnings saying 24-hour Grace and something you kicked off 12 years ago. My first question is for Zach. Zach, can you tell us in the 4.6% NII sensitivity what you're assuming for deposit repricing in that analysis? And what do you expect to actually happen as you think about the first few rate hikes? Zach Wasserman : Yes, that's a great question, Erika. Thank you. As it relates to deposit betas, I think it's a little too early to tell. We're expecting similar dynamics to the last major rate cycle. We do believe there will be competing forces here, some -- at the extremely low level of starting rates we're at right now would tend to indicate a higher beta. With that being said, the level of -- extraordinary levels of excess liquidity across the system would tend to mute that and indicate a lower beta. So, I say we're watching the situation very carefully on liquidity and the pace of loan growth. And we will be disciplined and dynamic as we go forward. In the actual modeling of the asset sensitivity, those models are intended to be stable on average over time and irrespective of the current level of interest rates to model the ramp. And so, the assumptions in that are around 25% to 30% beta, which has been sort of the long-term average we've seen. I would tell you, I believe there's an opportunity that will be lower than that in the initial rate moves and that's my general expectation. But again, I think we will be -- we will have to be dynamic and we're watching it really carefully. Erika Najarian : And my follow-up question to that is yesterday and this kind of follows up to what Ken Usdin was asking about earlier. A few regional banks, we're now expecting negative deposit growth. To your earlier point, Zach, the system is awash with liquidity and a few big banks kicked off earnings season saying that deposit growth won't be negative. And a few regional banks mentioned yesterday that they expect deposit growth to be negative. And I'm wondering, Huntington has always been known for its core operational deposit base plus you added TCF. I'm wondering how you're thinking about deposit growth. You mentioned it's going to be positive this year. But as we have more maturity in the rate cycle, how do you expect deposit growth to behave on an overall basis? Zach Wasserman : Yes, I do think our current expectation and the trends we're seeing in the business would indicate we will continue to see deposit growth in 2022. I think there's sort of two factors we've been watching that are slightly offsetting each other. On one hand, we do -- we are observing particularly in the consumer space, some degree of normalization of the elevated liquidity we saw build up at the tail end of 2020 and certainly into 2021, largely influenced by stimulus and other factors like that and the savings behavior around COVID. So that is sort of the gradual normalization. With that being said, our customer acquisition and the ongoing work we're doing to deepen relationships certainly augmented by the TCF synergy opportunities are offsetting that. And we expect to drive net growth in consumer offsetting that kind of pandemic deposit normalization trend that I noted. On the commercial side, we're seeing just continued robust liquidity in our clients and that's driving solid deposit growth. And as we focus on that even more going forward to continue to fund this accelerating loan growth, we will see that contribute as well. So overall, I'm expecting pretty balanced deposit growth between the two. And I think those are the kind of underlying drivers of it. Steve Steinour : Zach, if I to add to Erika's question, we put a liquidity portal in play for our commercial customers about a year and a half ago to try and take excess deposits and move them off-balance sheet, Erika. So, we're not sitting with a cumulative super jumbo set of commercial depositors in the portfolio. We just didn't want that risk profile, plus we felt we could do a better job looking at for the customers by putting them into this. So that will help cushion us as whatever normalization if there is any of the customer base curves. Secondly, we've introduced a digital tool, an analytics tool that has great promise for us. We've got roughly 500,000 business customers. And we're now able to get at the data in a much more real-time way in terms of product needs based on usage and other characteristics. So, we expect that will drive our TM business in a significant way in the years ahead. Erika Najarian : Very helpful. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thanks for your questions. Erika Najarian : Yes. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. You guys are the number one SBA lender. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of demand there now that PPP is kind of mostly done or winding down. I would imagine when PPP was going on, there is kind of little to no demand and wondering how that's been trending more recently. Steve Steinour : Matt, we had cumulative with TCF 12 -- over $12 billion of PPP lending. And notwithstanding that, we had robust SBA lending almost in parallel through the last 2 years. As we entered the fourth quarter, we continue to see demand for that product and we expect it will actually increase this year in part because of the new markets that we're going to be able to expose our capabilities to Twin Cities, a great business market. Denver, on fire, really terrific. Colorado is a terrific state to be doing business in. And now we're at -- roughly at scale in Chicago with 150-plus points of distribution versus 30. That will help those three regions drive our lending activity overall, including SBA. Matt O'Connor: Interesting. And then separately, credit quality question. You're a very big auto underwriter on the consumer side and commercial, but I'm focused on the consumer side. We've had this massive increase in used car prices. Any thoughts in terms of tightening standards as we think about LTVs? You've had a little bit of a trend down there with your disclosure in the appendix. But just how do you think about underwriting to these used cars that have increased 40%, 45% versus a year ago? Rich Pohle : Yes, Matt. It's Rich. I will take that. And as you noted in the slides, the LTVs have come down. We peaked in 2019 at 90% and we ended 2021 at 85%. So, we have reacted to the increase in auto prices by bringing the LTVs down. But first and foremost, for us, the auto business is really based on client selection. We are a super prime lender and we've developed a custom scorecard over many, many years in this business that very effectively predicts those customers that are not going to have a payment issue. And so, for us, it's really avoiding the situation where you have to get the car back in the first place. And we've done a phenomenal job of doing that over time. We also feel that we've been in this business a long time and we have to be a consistent provider of capital to our dealers. And so, we've, over the course of many cycles, worked through high prices, low prices, high demand, low demand. And we've had learnings from all of that as we've been one of the leading auto deal or auto financers in the country going back in time. So, I feel that we've got a good handle on the risk here, notwithstanding the increase in car prices. We've adjusted our custom scorecards appropriately and feel that we're going to come through this in really good shape as we always have. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Steve Steinour : We haven't had a delinquency on the floorplan side of this business, and I'm going to say, decades, certainly more than a decade since I've been around. And we really like the underlying credit quality performance that the dealers have been able to generate in the last couple of years. So, the fundamentals of the business with a low expected default rate in the indirect side and an incredibly low risk on the dealer side, keep us -- continue to keep us very bullish on the business. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. John Pancari : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Hey, John. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, John. John Pancari : I guess back to that auto question, I know in the -- in your loan growth outlook for high single digits for 2022, you do mention auto growth as a driver. I mean on the growth side, can you just talk about what -- how you're thinking about the portfolio growth as you look at the year, particularly if we get some moderation in used auto demand as the, let's call it, a reopening continues and everything? So, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on that portfolio specifically in terms of growth. Thanks. Steve Steinour : So, John, we would expect that portfolio will continue to grow. We're going to open up in another five or so states this year. We've had this gradual rollout now for a number of years. and that will complete us. Eventually, we will be in the lower 48 with this business. But we have a fundamental expectation of that the new car market is going to come back off of last year's production probably by 1.5 million, 2 million cars to get 15, 15.5 total on the new side. So that will pick up a bit. The mix will slightly shift again back to where it has historically or closer to that on the mix side of the equation. We -- as you know, we like the business. We think of it as low risk. It's a two and a quarter year average rated asset. And we're highly now automated. We have almost half of our apps coming through on a digital basis and it's end-to-end digital for us. So, we're very, very efficient with it. John Pancari : Okay, great. And then also related to that, I believe the utilization comment you gave earlier in terms of increasing from the mid-20s to the 30%. That's for the floor plan business, I believe, if you can just correct me if I'm wrong. And then if it is, what is your utilization trend for the non-floorplan commercial revolvers? Zach Wasserman : Yes, this is Zach. I'll take that. We saw nice upticks, modest upticks in utilization in every one of our three major line utilization categories. Auto, just to your point, it rose from 23% to 30% in the quarter. Inventory finance rose from 25% to 32% seasonally. That's typical in the fourth quarter for that business. And then the general middle market revolvers went from 40 to 41 in the quarter. So, we saw good early signs here, encouraging signs of that utilization recovery that we saw, as I said in my earlier remarks, of $5 billion of additional line utilization what we expect to recover back to pre-pandemic levels over the longer term. John Pancari : Got it. Got it. If I could ask just one more high-level one. Just some news this morning about Intel looking to build a pretty sizable chip facility there near Columbus. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the implications of something like that. Do you think there's follow-on benefits to loan demand there in your markets? And do you think there's a start of something where more of these tech companies could be building operations there in your markets? Steve Steinour : John, just for  -- what you're referencing is Intel's announcing a large chip plant. The CEO of Intel, call it, the largest chip plant in the world. It will be about 1 million square feet. It was initially a land of 1,000 acres to accommodate this. It's expected that there will be follow-ons and that there'll be other businesses, large businesses, suppliers to that plant that will co-locate as part of that 1,000 acre site. And this will be enormously impactful. I think the CEO, Pat Gelsinger, referenced this as Silicon Heartland because typically, these plants with the supplier base create some level of colocation that we would -- that you've seen in Arizona and certain other markets. So, this is incredibly impactful. It's a great move by the DeWine administration. I think it will benefit certainly all of Ohio and much of the Midwest and I think is a bit of a game changer for us. We will -- we're going to have more than 10,000 construction jobs on that site and roadway and water expansion. And then ultimately, there'll be 3,000 very high-paying jobs in the plant itself just with Intel. Again, there's an expectation of other businesses coming in for colocation, significant other businesses. All of that will feed and fuel, I think what's already a very robust real estate market. There's going to be housing needs. There will be additional transportation needs. The small business around the -- small businesses around these areas will do very, very well. So, it's a huge moment for us here in all of Ohio, certainly Central Ohio but I think this has the potential to be enormous. If I reflect back in 2009 when I joined Huntington, this was term the Rust Belt and that term has receded significantly over the years. And I think Intel is going to be a game changer in terms of technology in the region and very excited about what's going on. So again, kudos to Governor DeWine and his administration would take over John Houston was enormously important here as well. But this came together in an incredibly efficient and quick fashion. And there's insight about it on both the local paper, Columbus Dispatch, as well as I think TIME has a lead article feature that. We are really, really pleased and I believe this is, again, a huge moment for us and a game-changing moment for Ohio. John Pancari : Very helpful. Thanks, Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Terry McEvoy : Hi, thanks. I was hoping to get your thoughts on capital management and just appetite for share repurchase in the first half of 2022 with capital at about 9.3% at the end of the year. Zach Wasserman : Yes, a great question. Thanks and I appreciate the chance to take a close on this one. We are really pleased with what we've done so far in the $800 million share repurchase authorization that we had, as we noted and consistent with our guidance, front-loaded $650 million of that through the end of 2021. I think as we go forward, our capital priorities have not changed. We are still very much focused on funding asset growth first, supporting our dividend and that's sort of all other uses, including this. So, as we see loan growth accelerating, we're pleased be able to put the capital back toward that. Now, to share purchases -- sorry for the background noise there. We intend to be dynamic here. And also, to think about it in the context of our ongoing work around, our next capital budget submission, which is -- which will reset the balance of 2022 as well with the submission in early April. So dynamic to see the opportunities here in the next couple of quarters, I think it's what we're going to know. Terry McEvoy : Great. I will end it there and let everybody get on with their day. Thanks, Zach and thanks, Steve. Have a good day. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Terry. Steve Steinour : Thank you all for joining us today. We're very proud of our colleagues' efforts to deliver a successful finish to '21 and we look forward to building all that as we enter the new year. I have a great deal of confidence in our teams and what Huntington can deliver for our colleagues, customers and shareholders over the course of '22. We have a deeply embedded stock ownership mentality, which aligns the interest of our board, management and colleagues with our shareholders as you know and thank you very much for your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing today can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As reminder, this call is being recorded, and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. As noted on slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A portion, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome, and thank you for joining the call today. It's been an eventful start to the year. We entered 2022 with momentum, and we carried forward that trend to deliver a strong first quarter. We are managing through a turbulent macroeconomic environment, high inflation, persistent labor and supply chain constraints, fed interest rate tightening, rapid moves in the yield curve and the devastating crisis in Ukraine, all have made for a challenging backdrop. Now on to slide 4. I'm pleased to highlight our excellent first quarter performance. First, our colleagues are delivering on revenue-producing initiatives supporting our strong results. We're generating profitable growth and building momentum, including executing on our revenue synergies. Second, operating with disciplined expense management, we posted another quarter of sequential reductions in core expenses. Our targeted cost savings are on track for full realization this quarter, and we are capturing these benefits even earlier than originally guided. Third, we had record low net charge-offs this quarter with overall exceptional credit quality. Our disciplined risk management continues to be a strength. Lastly, we are confident in our full year outlook and our ability to drive additional profitability. We are revising our guidance higher to incorporate the recent rate curve outlook, and we remain confident that we will achieve our medium-term financial targets in the second half of 2022. On slide 5, let me share more detail on our first quarter performance. Our robust loan growth, higher net interest income and planned reductions in expenses supported a record PPNR. Average loan balances, excluding PPP, grew 10% annualized, driven by new loan production across both commercial and consumer portfolios. We continue to see strong customer demand and growing loan pipelines and are confident this momentum will continue over the course of this year. Our teams are fully aligned and executing on the revenue synergy opportunities from TCF. We are seeing terrific momentum in these initiatives as we expand into new markets with enhanced capabilities. In the Twin Cities, our new wealth management, business banking and mid-market teams are already contributing to revenues. Likewise, in Colorado, our business banking and middle market teams are capturing market share and generating revenue. We're also pleased with our inventory finance business, which has seen seasonal growth and is exceeding our expectations. Additionally, we are seeing increased productivity and positive recession to the Huntington product set and customer service experience. We continue to execute on our strategic initiatives across the bank. In March, we announced the next evolution of our leading Fair Play product set, including the soon-to-be-released instant access feature as well as an enhanced credit card offering through the launch of our cash-back credit card. In addition, our continued expense discipline has enabled us to support investments that are yielding results. This is evidenced by our record first quarter of sales in Wealth Management and also by another quarter of robust growth in our capital markets businesses. Just last month, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Capstone Partners, a top-tier middle market investment bank and advisory firm that will add significant capabilities and expertise to our capital markets businesses. The transaction is expected to close late this quarter. Capstone is a terrific fit with Huntington, both strategically and culturally, and we're excited for the synergistic growth opportunities. The addition of Capstone better positions us to serve the full range of needs for clients and our footprint as well as those we serve on an increasingly national basis. The transaction adds key verticals that complement our existing industry specialization and adds new capabilities in expanded sectors. We expect Capstone will meaningfully increase our capital markets revenues by about 50%, and we're excited to welcome our new colleagues to Huntington. Finally, we are proud to share a few of the awards we received during the quarter. We were honored to be recognized by Forbes in 2022 as one of America's best large employers, where we ranked number 7 in the banking and financial services industry. We were also recognized in middle market and small business banking with numerous Greenwich Excellence and Best Band Awards for 2021. And lastly, we are proud that The National Diversity Council named Donald Dennis, our Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, as a Top 100 Diversity Officer nationally. Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Brant Standridge to Huntington who joined us earlier this month as our President of Consumer and Business Banking. Brad comes to us with a broad set of experiences, including a customer-focused foundation that aligns well with our strategies. As Brant joins us, a special thank you to Steve Rhodes, who will continue to lead our Business Banking division. Slide 6 shows our continued trajectory of profitable growth. We've been driving sustainable profitability for years supported by our prior strategic investments and our long track record of managing the positive operating leverage. We are confident that this increasing trend will continue and will further benefit by the underlying earnings power unlocked from TCF. We are poised to have outsized PPNR growth this year and expect it to expand sequentially over the remainder of the year. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides highlights of our first quarter results. We reported earnings per common share of $0.29. Adjusted for notable items, earnings per common share were $0.32. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came at 15.8% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 17.1%. We were pleased to see accelerated momentum in our loan balances, with total loans increasing by $1.7 billion and excluding PPP, loans increased by $2.6 billion. Total average and ending deposits also increased, driven by strong trends in both consumer and commercial balances. Pre-provision net revenue grew 4.2% from last quarter, reflecting our continued focus on self-funding revenue-producing strategic initiatives, as well as net interest income expansion. Consistent with our plan, we reduced core expenses by $27 million from last quarter, driven by the realization of cost synergies. Credit quality was exceptional, with record low net charge-offs of seven basis points and nonperforming assets reduced to 63 basis points. Turning to slide 8. Accelerated loan growth momentum continued, with average loan balances increasing 1.5% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $111.1 billion. Excluding PPP, total loan balances increased $2.6 billion or 2.4%, largely driven by commercial loans. Within commercial, excluding PPP, average loans increased by $2.2 billion or 3.8% from the prior quarter. We continue to see broad-based demand across lending categories that is supporting strong new production. We are also benefiting from slowing prepayments and modest increases in line utilization. Middle market, asset finance, corporate and specialty banking, all contributed to higher net balances within commercial and have all expanded for two quarters in a row. Commercial real estate balances also increased during the quarter by $485 million. Inventory Finance contributed to growth this quarter with balances increasing by $666 million, driven by the expansion of client relationships and the expected seasonal increase in utilization levels. Auto dealer floor plan increased with balances by $251 million as new client relationships and a modest uptick in utilization, both supported growth. In Consumer, we had a record first quarter performance in indirect auto and RV marine originations. This drove balances higher in auto and RV/Marine by $108 million and $63 million, respectively. Additionally, on-sheet residential mortgage increased by $550 million. These were offset by lower home equity balances. Across the enterprise, our bankers are executing disciplined calling strategies, driving sustained growth in both early-stage and late-stage loan pipelines, both of which are higher from the prior quarter and the prior year. We are seeing strong demand from our customers and the realization of pipelines supports our high degree of confidence in our 2022 outlook. Turning to slide nine. We delivered solid deposit growth, with balances higher by $614 million. On a spot basis, total deposit balances increased $3.7 billion or 2.6% from prior quarter. Ending commercial balances increased by $2.5 billion and consumer balances increased by $1.5 billion from the prior quarter. This growth reflects continued consumer deposit gathering and our focused relationship deepening within commercial customers. On slide 10, we reported net interest income and NIM expansion. Core net interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, increased by 3% to $1.119 billion. Consistent with prior guidance, net interest margin increased versus prior quarter, and we are on track for further NIM expansion throughout 2022. Turning to slide 11, we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to remain asset sensitive and capture the benefit of expected higher rates while incrementally providing downside protection opportunities present themselves. We have a peer-leading NIM, and we're positioned to expand margin as rates increase. During the quarter, we modestly increased our downside protection by executing a net $2.7 billion of received fixed swaps. As noted on the slide, these explicit hedging actions reduced asset sensitivity in the quarter by 0.3%. The overall estimated asset sensitivity and an up 100 basis point ramp scenario ended the quarter at 3.1%, down from 4.6% at year-end. The remaining change in this metric beyond our hedging actions was driven by other ancillary modeling impacts such as the denominator impact of higher projected base net interest income, slower prepayments and other balance sheet mix shifts. On the bottom of the slide is our loan portfolio composition. As you can see, we are well positioned for the expected higher interest rates throughout the year with an attractive mix of floating and fixed rate loans. Furthermore, our indirect auto portfolio has a weighted average life of approximately 25 months with roughly half of that portfolio re-pricing each year. Moving to slide 12. Non-interest income was $499 million, up $104 million year-over-year and down $16 million from last quarter. Fee revenues were impacted by a decline in mortgage banking, primarily due to lower saleable originations as well as typical seasonality resulting in lower cards and payments activities compared to the fourth quarter. Given our robust SBA pipelines and attractive market opportunity, we reinitiated our SBA loan sales in the quarter, driving a $27 million increase. In addition, our record first quarter performance in wealth management sales contributed to an increase in investment-related revenues. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the traction and growth outlooks for our key fee-generating businesses within payments, capital markets and wealth and advisory. Moving on to slide 13. Non-interest expense declined $168 million from the prior quarter and excluding notable items, core expenses declined by $27 million to $1.07 billion as we delivered cost savings from the acquisition. As we shared previously, we expect core expenses to be approximately $1 billion by the second quarter. Even as we're driving down expenses, we're also investing in initiatives that are driving sustainable revenue growth throughout the company. Slide 14 highlights our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 was 9.2% at quarter end. Our dividend yield remains at the top of our peer group at 4.6%. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to our announced signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Capstone. As you can see on slide 15, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were record low of seven basis points, benefiting from a net recovery position in commercial portfolios and continued strong consumer credit quality. Non-performing assets and criticized loans both declined from the previous quarter. Our ending allowance for credit losses represented 1.87% of total loans, down from 1.89% at prior quarter end. Slide 16 covers our medium-term financial targets, which remain unchanged. As Steve mentioned, we're fully committed to achieving these by the second half of 2022. As our loan growth momentum continues, our first capital priority remains funding this organic growth, and we are encouraged by these trends. To the extent that our loan growth remains as robust as we expect, I would anticipate share buybacks will be de minimis for the remainder of the year. We are comfortable operating at or around these current capital levels as we balance our expected 2022 growth plans and the possible longer-term scenarios for the global macroeconomic outlook as we had in 2023. Finally, turning to Slide 17, let me share our updated outlook. The guidance we provided in January assumed continued economic expansion aligned to market consensus as well as the interest rate yield curve expectations as of early January. Our updated guidance continues to assume further economic growth and the rate curve as of the end of March. As a result of the rate curve outlook, we are revising upward our guidance in net interest income. We now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, to grow in the mid to high teens. This is higher than our previous guidance of high single-digit to low double-digit growth. In fee income, while we are seeing encouraging trends in our payments, capital markets and wealth and advisory businesses, we are also impacted by the industry-wide mortgage banking pressure. Based on this, we have revised lower our fee guidance to flat to down low single digits, excluding the impact of Capstone. On the topic of Capstone, we are anticipating closing the acquisition at the end of this quarter. Based on estimates created during due diligence, we believe the business could add approximately $20 million to $30 million of fee income on a quarterly basis. This would be incremental to the stand-alone Q4 Huntington guidance. We will provide further information on the impact of Capstone, as we complete the acquisition and finalize our financial forecast. On expenses, excluding notable items, we are still tracking to our $1 billion run rate for this quarter. And again, this guidance is excluding Capstone. Finally, given our continued exceptional credit performance across our portfolios, we are revising our full year net charge-offs down to approximately 20 basis points from less than 30 basis points previously. Now let me pass it back to Steve for a couple of closing comments before we open for Q&A. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Zach. Slide 18 recaps what we believe is a compelling opportunity. Huntington stands as a powerful top 10 regional bank with scale and leading market density, as well as a compelling set of capabilities, both in footprint and nationally. We are focused on executing our strategic plan, which we believe will drive substantial value creation for our shareholders. We are well positioned to deliver sustainable revenue growth, which is bolstered by new markets, new businesses and expanded capabilities. As our revenue synergies accelerate and gain traction, we also remain committed to our proactive and disciplined expense management. As a result, we are increasingly confident in our robust return profile with expectations for a 17-plus percent ROTCE, as we deliver on our medium-term financial targets in the second half of the year. Tim, let's open up the call for Q&A, please. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Steve. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator, let's open-up the questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first questions come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to see if you could unpack the upgraded NII guide a little bit, give us a sense as to how much of that is coming from the forward curve changes, from the loan growth from the cash redeployment, just to understand those puts and takes a little bit more thoroughly? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Sure. Betsy, thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll take that. The main driver is the rate curve of what we're seeing come through with expected forward rates. To give you a sense, at the time of our budget, we had approximately five rate hikes baked into our forecast going from 25 basis points up to 150 basis points in Fed funds by September of 2023, and it was 75 basis points by the end of 2022. Now obviously, it's significantly changed the yield curve up to 300 basis points or 150 basis points better by March 23 and with $275 million by December, so a full 200 basis points better by the end of this year. So that's the majority of what's driving it. Given our asset sensitivity, we're poised to benefit from that, both from spread \u2013 and I would say as well from the reduced drag from Fed cash that we saw in Q1 that will help us to drive that peer leading to that we expect at this point. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then as I think about the flexibility you have in your balance sheet, I'm just wondering, how you're planning on funding the loan growth that you're anticipating getting from here? And is there anything left over to increase the redeployment into the curve? Zach Wasserman : I think at this point, we're expecting to continue to grow deposits as well. We see nice trends in continued deposit gathering, commercial growing faster than consumer, but both continue to be solid producers and that will be the main funding source as well as, as I said, utilizing some of the continued excess liquidity we've got on cash at this point. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning. John Pancari : In terms of the \u2013 I know you mentioned that you're seeing strengthening in loan growth momentum and you cited improvement in line utilization. Could you just talk about exactly what areas are you seeing this strengthening? How much did the line utilization improved? Are you beginning to see CapEx-related demand start to drive growth? Zach Wasserman : Sure. This is Zach. I'll take that one and my colleague from room here could take on the like me. Generally, we're really pleased with what we're seeing in loan taking a big step back. The strength that we're seeing in our pipeline, the realization of that flowing through into \u2013 into bookings is what gives us confidence, and we'll continue to see the momentum drive to that high single-digit loan growth by Q4. And the model for it is going to be pretty similar in the back half of the year as what we've seen for the last two quarters. That is production led with commercial growing faster than consumer, but consumer continuing to drive as well. And the sources of it within commercial, we're seeing just continued strength in mid-market. Our corporate specialty areas, equipment, inventory finance also contributing very well. Commercial real estate and auto dealer floor plan, although delivering also on the consumer side, on sheet residential mortgage is really driven by what we're seeing in the mix of purchase as well as the continued steady growth in auto and RV/Marine will really be the drivers there. From a utilization perspective, I would characterize what we saw in the quarter as modest, but encouraging and I think a healthy sign for our customers. Saw around 1% increase in general middle market lines, several percentage point increase in inventory financial. And most of that was seasonal, which is encouraging sign to see the inventory now beginning to flow to those dealers on more a steady basis that allows them to hold the inventory. And then the auto dealer floor plan business also increased by a couple of percentage points as well. And again, I think that's a function of just gradually improving auto supply chain. So overall, a pretty healthy mix in the model going forward, as I said, is production and very much driven by commercial. Steve Steinour : And John, this is Steve. I would add. We invested since closing with TCF in a number of these lending units. So we have a lot of capacity that's been brought on, particularly in Twin Cities and Denver and some of the specialty groups. So we're just -- we're able to scale the businesses as well. And so we'll be picking up volume from these investments throughout this year and beyond. Rich Pohle : And John, it's Rich. The last part of your question had to do with CapEx spending. We are absolutely seeing an increase in capital spending, given just the tightness of the labor market. So there's an intense move to automation, and we'll continue to see that through the course of the year. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks. And sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory of your data and your deposit beta expectation, how the deposit cost could trend early on for the first 100 basis points of hikes and then thereafter? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. John, this is Zach, I'll take that one. Generally, across the totality of the rate hike cycle, our expectation is that we're going to see similar dynamics this rate cycle as we saw in the last one. Clearly, there are some competing forecast forces there with lower starting rates that might signal a little higher beta, but the level of excess liquidity across the industry would tend to blend to the beta and they could be lower. As I think has been noted by a number of industry participants over time. I think the general operating assumption of the industry, and we share this is that the early impacts around beta for the first several rate moves is going to be relatively lower and it will increase as the interest rate environment reaches a higher level.  But I would say two things. One is what's really important to us is how we're poised to manage against this with very robust, pretty detailed product-by-product segmented client-by-client management approaches, watching the market very carefully so that we can react and really be incredibly disciplined. And I think secondly, we're poised to benefit quite a bit here through the cycle, given the long strategy we've had to drive for primary bank relationships and core operating accounts within our business and commercial accounts. So we feel good about how we're positioned and really just staying very vigilant to manage through it, as we go forward with the next few quarters. John Pancari : Okay. In fact, what is your through-cycle beta that you're assuming in your current ALCO assumption? Zach Wasserman : Yes. It's about 30%. That's what we saw in the last cycle, which was baked into our model internally. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks Zach. Zach Wasserman : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First question I wanted to ask was on the cost side. Once we get down to the about $1 billion per quarter in expenses coming up shortly here, is the plan hold to hover around that level for the remainder of the year, or are any of these inflationary pressures just sort of overwhelming that prior outlook? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Generally, for the back half of this year, I mean, we feel great about where the costs are driving to. And, I think, we feel -- we've got exceptionally strong line of sight to see the $1 billion by -- $1 billion of core expense run rate by Q2. And that will leave us then poised to really deliver on those medium-term financial targets we've talked about. My expectation is roughly flat in the back half of this year. We're certainly seeing some inflationary pressures. And as we outperform on revenue, there's a bit of expenses that will drive for that. But generally speaking, it's approximately flat in the back half of the year based on our current outlook. And that's really driven by just very rigorous expense discipline throughout the company and driving for efficiency in our base expenses and with a mindset towards self-funding the investments we're putting into the revenue growth initiatives that we've talked about that you just mentioned a minute ago. Longer term, as we get out into 2023, the way we're posturing our long-range planning is really guided by our commitment to operating leverage, which we've delivered eight of the last nine years and feel confident and proud that we'll be able to do that again as we go into 2023. Steve Steinour : You might also, Scott, be aware, we're -- we announced the acquisition of Capstone. And so, as that closes, that run rate will have to be incorporated in as well. Scott Siefers : Yes. Perfect. Thank you. And then, Zach, as we look forward, do you anticipate altering your rate sensitivity kind of synthetically anymore, or will it just sort of be a function -- will changes in your sense sensitivity just be a function of kind of changes in the complexion of the balance sheet from here on out? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Thanks, Scott, for that one. We really like the level of asset sensitivity we have right now. As you know, we took a series of conservative actions last year to get to the point we are now, and we're really benefiting from it. But all along that way, we've talked about when opportunities came up to protect some of the downside to lock in some of that benefit, we would likely take that. And so that's what you saw us do it in Q1 with the net $2.7 billion of received fixed swaps, pretty modest impact on asset sensitivity as we noted in the prepared remarks, around 0.3%. From here, I would expect us to stay very much net asset sensitive in the near term. Meanwhile, slowly adding to that downside hedge protection book over the course of the coming months, as we watch the environment. We would say dynamic, that could change, but it's the general operating posture here at this point. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Good. Thank you, guys, very much. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Hey, Zach, one follow-up on the cost point. So if you're in that $1 billion zone-ish plus or minus towards the end of the year, would we then add Capstone to that? And do you have an approximate calibration relative to the revenue outlook, what you'd expect on the cost side from Capstone? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Thanks for that question. I want to make sure we clarify that. So that guidance is excluding Capstone to be clear. On Capstone, we're really diving into the modeling right now and we'll come back with further guidance as we get closer to and through the close. Based on the due-diligence modeling and the company's historical run rate that we are aware of, the kind of core efficiency ratio of that business is pretty similar to what other M&A advisory boutique firms would have.  On top of that in the near-term quarters, we'll have a little bit of merger-related costs. I'm not expecting very significant comp there at all. And then lastly, some incremental compensation expenses to fund retention payments, which are really important for a deal like this. So more to come, we'll give clear guidance on it as we get closer to the acquisition. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just one question on fees. In your outlook, can you help us understand what the either incremental or total impact is of Fair Play and other changes to deposit products? And are you also assuming that you continue to sell SBA loans, like you got back into this quarter? Thanks Zach. Zach Wasserman : Yes, no problems. Those are both important points. As it relates to the Fair Play evolution, nothing has changed from the guide we provided back in March in the RBC Conference, which is around $14 million of net impact on the fee line relative to the Q4, '21 run rate That was slightly better than the earlier guidance we provided in in January continues to be our expectation of the impact on the fee line.  As we've noted a number of times, overtime over the course of the 18 to 24 months after that, we do expect to claw that back and to benefit from higher acquisition, better retention, more account deepening as a result of those changes, but that's the kind of immediate impact. And then \u2013 sorry, the second part of your question was? Ken Usdin : The SBA loans and are you baking that into the outlook as well? Zach Wasserman : Yes. So, we are expecting to continue to get back to our historical practice of selling the guaranteed portion of our SBA loan production. It should -- it bears noting that the team is performing exceptionally strongly right now and really doing really, really well, driving production. So, we think that's going to support the sustainment of that sale gains, which is great.  In Q1, we had a bit of higher gains than we would have expected in the quarter just given by \u2013 from the really high level of premium in the marketplace. So it might kind of modulate modestly from that level as we go forward. But generally, that run rate will continue. And the expectation is that we'll continue to, in fact, sell that production like we have historically done. Steve Steinour : And Ken, we've invested in the SBA unit as well over the course of last year, adding SBA capabilities in Colorado and Minnesota, in particular, and they're off to a great start. So, we should have a record year in terms of production. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Hey good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Rich, a question for you. Can you give us your assessment of consumer health right now? There's just some mixed messages out in the market. And just give us your assessment of what you're thinking right now? Rich Pohle : Yes. No, happy to. From our standpoint, the consumer is in very good shape, particularly in the super prime segments where we play. If you look at the delinquency numbers. From our standpoint, it's all seasonal, in terms of the normal patterns that we're following there. So, we feel good about it, particularly in the spots where we play. We do expect over the course of 2022, the consumer credit metrics will start to revert a bit to the norm, but we've remained very disciplined with our LTVs and our FICOs. So, we're very comfortable with that book. It's been a steady state performer over many cycles. We feel good about it. Steve Steinour : And Jon, there is a phenomenon sort of lower income where the price of gas at the pump and inflation generally, including housing, is having an impact. But again, we've been super prime for more than a decade and the consistency of the performance in that, whether it's residential assets or auto will hold us in very good shape. We give the portfolio in aggregate to be on the low end of the risk spectrum, when we talk about aggregate moderate to low. Jon Arfstrom : Yeah, okay. Fair enough. And then, wondering if you guys can touch a little bit more on the inventory finance themes, you called that out as a growing area. And obviously, it's something we all watch particularly in auto, but I know that the TCF business was in a few other sectors. But talk a little bit about the themes and what you're seeing there? Steve Steinour : Well, this is a group that has been in existence now of even TCF that sort of formed it many years ago. And we're doing business with about 14,000 dealers nationally. So there's great distribution with the team. It's very high quality, very steady and experienced team, and we've got just an outstanding dealer relationship. So, we're able to, with OEMs, to be dynamic in part of their sales process and there are different agreements depending on the OEM in support of the dealer. So again, this group performs very well. It's gone through cycles with very low loss rates and the dealers will generally support each other. Certainly, the OEMs will support transitions of dealers that happens from time to time. So, the big issue for the group right now is just how to -- what's the schedule for ramping up supply. And as we talk about supply chain disruptions, they're feeling it in many areas, including most of the dealers. So this will be a group that just naturally will grow over time because inventories are so low. So we expect to do very well over the next few years with the group. And it's also a group that this provides great customer service and it's typically been adding OEMs every year, and we would expect that to continue this year based on the discussions that occurred thus far in the year. So very bullish on the group, a great team, one of the hidden jewels to some extent from TCF and it will allow us to do other things on the consumer finance side, and we'll talk about that probably in an upcoming conference. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I think I asked the same question last quarter about LTVs and auto. But I guess I'm just curious, we've seen a little bit of a trend down in the LTV and really good disclosure on slide 34, I'm looking at. But just as we think about used car prices being inflated and new car prices and even like the RV and Marine, are there thoughts to further tighten some of these metrics to just insulate yourself from corrections there? Rich Pohle : Matt, it's Rich. I'll take that one. We actually think the lower prices -- the used car prices coming down is a good thing. And if you look at the mix of new to used, it's actually picking up a little bit from the third quarter of 2021. So we are seeing more new product coming in as part of the mix. From an overall standpoint, we are a super prime lender in that space. We've got a high FICO and we use our custom scorecard that's been very effective in keeping us from relying on having to take the cars back in the first place. So we aren't really that concerned about the price movement that we've seen in the industry. We've been able to keep the LTVs, as you mentioned, in the mid-80s. And FICO goes around that 7.70 to 7.75 range. So we feel good about that. On the RV side, keep in mind, too, that that loan to value is based on wholesale costs, not the retail cost. So that's going to show a little bit higher, but there, we're in that 800-plus FICO. So from our standpoint, we don't see any real need to tighten. We've had great experience in both of those books. The RV/Marine book went through its first cycle with us really in the last couple of years and then outperformed our expectations from a loss standpoint. So we're not concerned at all about either one of those portfolios. Steve Steinour : And we've been in the auto business, Matt, for more than half a century. And we were able to stress test the portfolios in 2009 where we had 10% and 14% unemployment rates. So we think we've got this really dialed in and there's a discipline with this quarterly reporting that goes back over a decade that shows this consistency. So while there may be some movement in loss rates, the overall approach has been very low to fault frequency based on the underwriting. Matt O'Connor: That\u2019s helpful. And then a similar question on the mortgage and home equity book just in the next slide, again, really helpful seeing this data over a couple of years. But there, we've seen a more material change in the LTV, in your originations. And, I guess, I'm curious, is that something that you're driving, or is that something that your client base is driving the -- using more equity against these loans? Thank you. Rich Pohle : No. I think it's really a combination of both, but I would say it's more of the customers driving it than we've done any tightening. I think certainly, we've been conscious of housing prices. And I think what you're seeing on the slide there shows that we've been disciplined with our originations and making sure that there's sufficient equity going into the loan to keep us safe if there's a drop in values. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Steve Steinour : We like secured consumer lending, Matt, as we've shared in the past, and we believe that will put us in a comparatively great shape through the cycles. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up with Betsy's earlier line of questioning, Zach. I'm wondering if you could quantify the earning asset growth that you're expecting. I know you're looking forward to more deposit growth from here. But just thinking about how we should think about earning asset growth relative to that high single-digit loan growth? And also at what point an absolute rate should we start modeling in or thinking about positive total deposit growth, but perhaps negative mix shift away from non-interest-bearing deposits? Zachary Wasserman : Yeah. Good questions, both. Let me just see as some incremental color. As it relates to sort of the earning asset side of your question, there will really be two parts to it. One, that loan growth in the high single-digits as we talked about. Secondly, on the securities book. My expectation -- right now, we're standing at about 24%. I think precisely 24.5% of assets on securities. I think we will stay within the range of 24% to 26% of securities assets here for the foreseeable future just as we manage yield and liquidity and just general balance sheet management. So those two factors will drive, I think, the earning assets likewise to be pretty similar to loan growth guidance. From a deposit perspective, it's hard to sort of be overly precise in terms of the threshold level where things start to unstick and move. Our general assumption is going to be, I said, relatively lower beta initially higher later, and so we'll see that trending throughout the period. And so that's sort of generally the dynamic. The one thing I would just maybe add to my comment around the earning asset growth is just remember as well that we will have -- the one factor that will draw that down a bit is the cash side where we're continuing to redeploy our cash into funding the loan growth. And so that we've got around $6 billion on average now that will trend down throughout the course of the year back towards more like the $1 billion to typical operating range we'd see, which will pull down in earning assets growth, but that really will benefit NIM as we higher earning assets. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question is for Steve. Steve, you've done a good job in terms of balancing, investing into the franchise and extracting cost savings, some cost savings to fund that and delivering on the TCF cost savings. I'm wondering as we think about the revenue set up from here, we clearly got from Zach the second half outlook, but good performing banks are thinking about that are sort of settled in their investment cycle have been saying something like 2% to 3% expense growth is sort of a core expense growth to think about in the future taking into account inflation. Is that something that seems reasonable for your company as you look forward perhaps the second half of 2022? Steve Steinour : Well, we've guided for the second half of 2022 earlier. You heard Zach's comments of generally being flattish around $1 billion of expense, and that would include the expectations of inflation and other investments that we plan to make. We started with a view of 22 last August when we did a round of expense reductions to set up and deal with the inflation, Erika, and that included the 62 branches that consolidated in early February this year. So we're on track with the plan that we laid out last summer, and we're on track, if not ahead, with TCF at this point. So a lot of confidence in this year, and then we'll be adding Capstone. We think we've got revenue synergies coming with that as well. So we like how we're positioned at this stage and optimistic certainly very confident for the year and optimistic about going forward. We will be dynamic with operating expenses relative to revenues. We've committed to positive operating leverage. And I think it's eight out of nine years in the past, and you can count on that being part of our 2023 equation. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you so much Steve. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thanks Erika. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I just had one question, Steve and Zach. I think you mentioned you hit the 17% plus medium term ROTCE target back half of the year. Just talk to us in terms of the sustainability of the ROTCE profile from here, looking into the medium term, just in terms of the downside risk as we think about maybe getting to a point where the Fed goes back to cutting interest rates, some normalization in credit. What's the level of ROTCE that you think is defensible even in a less conducive revenue backdrop? Zach Wasserman : This is Zach and I'll take the first shot at that and then Steve to see if he wants to tack on as well. Generally, feel great about the 17% level. So, for the foreseeable future and forecasting that level even if the budgeted rate curve, which I mentioned before, was considerably lower than the current rate curve. So, I think that we feel good about that level over the medium term, as we said. One of the things that we're, frankly, internally really excited about is getting to the second half of the year, delivering these medium term targets that we first put out in December of 2020 when we announced the TCF acquisition and then being able to reset and provide some updated guidance at that point. And my expectation is we'll see at or above that level that guidance as well. Steve Steinour : So, just to add, we had a very good first quarter. We've talked since the fourth quarter about growing momentum, but we are not hitting on all cylinders. We still see a lot of upside on the TCF synergies and on some of the other investments we've made. So, there's a revenue dynamic that we hope we'll be able to continue and expect to be able to continue to develop throughout this year, and that will provide some cushion for maybe normalized provision as well as somewhat different scenarios. Like the way the businesses are positioned, we're roughly balanced, as you know, consumer and business. And on the business side, we've had a lot of scale added with TCF and investments made in new capabilities and products, and you'll continue to see that. That's part of the plan as we go forward this year. And I think that's going to position us to have a consistency over the next few years in a variety of scenarios. Zach Wasserman : The one thing I would just tack on to that, just at the end here is a key contributor to this is not only our balance sheet and capital allocation, which is just ever more robust and dialed in to drive cost returns, but also the growth of our fee businesses. Notwithstanding our guidance that we provided this quarter where fees will be growing. So, it's slower than spread by Q4 of this year, just driven by the extraordinary rate environment driven by some temporal factors in mortgage and our fair play product evolution, broadly speaking, though, I think the course of the long-term, which was nature of your question, I expect fee revenues to grow as a percentage of revenues by around a percentage point per year. And I think that disciplined capital allocation driving for returns, the driving toward fee-intensive businesses and payments and capital markets at our wealth and advisory, those things are the ones that sort of contribute to that sustaining ROE even under various interest rate scenarios. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's clear. And just as a quick follow-up to that. How do you own no buybacks this year? But when we think about capital allocation, and you mentioned on the fee side, anything that we should expect in terms of inorganic growth, be it Capstone-like transactions or anything on the fintech side or the wealth management that you're looking at? Steve Steinour : Well, there are fee businesses that if they were available would be interesting to us. But I would characterize them generally on the smaller side and wouldn't change the overall guidance that Zach provided to you. As we continue to build out our capabilities, we look from time-to-time as we did with Huntington Technology Finance, -- I think, four or five years ago. And so this is -- there may be some opportunities over the next couple of years to complement our capabilities and build the fee-generating potential to an even greater extent than what Zach portrayed. And if we find things that make sense and would be additive to our customer service and our customer growth then we'd look at that. But we're generally very focused on driving the opportunities we have in hand with the TCF combination and the investments we've already made. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you, next one. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Steven Alexopoulos : Hi. Good morning everyone. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : I wanted to first follow-up on deposits. I didn't fully understand your response to Erika's question. What's the deposit growth assumption that's underlying the NII guide for 2022? Zach Wasserman : I haven't provided that guidance precisely, but I do expect continued, let's call it, mid-single-digit deposit growth overall commercial growing faster. Consumer growing a little slower, but both are growing. And I think on the consumer side, we are not seeing any imminent signs of any change in the level of savings activity and sort of trends around deposits. I think the whole concept of surge balances has been somewhat debunked at this point, but they're fairly sticky and the trends are fairly stable on the consumer side. On the commercial side, we're really benefiting from just sort of penetrating operating accounts and our focus around treasury management that's driving that as well as new client acquisition through particularly our growth in middle market and our specialty areas. So, generally seeing it is positive continued growth in deposits that are going to be single-digit slow. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Steve, on the Capstone deal, is this really intended to make you more of a one-stop shop, right, better position you to serve existing clients, or is this a new focus for Huntington, right? You're going to invest meaningfully in this capability? And do you plan to build your banking capabilities around these new verticals you're picking up? Thanks. Steve Steinour : Capstone is a top-ranked middle market investment bank and advisory firm in its own right. But we have a significant client base that if the services were made available to them would help us expand our menu of cross-sell and eventually even feed our wealth businesses. So we felt this was an important additional component to the core delivery. It does give us expertise in a select number of verticals that they have as well, or access to that. And I think that will help the commercial bank grow overall. I suspect we'll continue to build out their investment banking capabilities on a national basis, so that will be additive. But we really think it's synergistic with us at the core of what we're doing and are quite optimistic about this. We have been working with them for over a year in terms of a fee share arrangement for certain referrals both ways and have really gotten insight into the culture of the company and its capabilities. And that's what made this opportunity very attractive. Steven Alexopoulos : And do you plan on building out the banking in areas like fintech services, energy, et cetera? Is that part of the plan? Steve Steinour : We don't have plans on the build-out yet. We have a -- we're maybe a couple of months away from even closing on what they have and -- but where they have specialty capabilities, now we will take advantage of those. We'll look at that if there's some augmentation to scale up to where they have existing capabilities. And then over time, we'll assess new areas. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Foran : Hi. I guess maybe one follow-up on deposits, and I'll preface it. I definitely remember last time or last rising rate cycle, you really outperformed the industry on deposit growth, especially low-cost deposit growth. So kind of history is on your side and you've done it before. But, I guess, mid-single-digit growth led by commercial, like, I say, probably the center capacity of your, is like flattish deposit growth this year with commercial maybe declining a bit. You listed a couple of reasons, but can you just maybe flesh out kind of your high single-digit commercial growth in an environment where peers are down a little bit? What is really -- how do you get that much differentiation? Zach Wasserman : It's hard to say much about the comparison to peers is, not knowing what's in their business and the visibility that they've got. All I can tell you is, we seem to be gaining market share in winning, particularly on the commercial side. And I think it's not surprising to us, because we've been investing in our commercial business and the flow-through of deposits is sort of the manifestation of the returns on those investments we've been making, both exclusive of TCF and then as of late, really capturing the TCF opportunity to build in the middle market. As we said, we're building out terrific middle market teams in the Denver and Colorado area and the Twin Cities and just generally seizing the opportunity that's available within the new TCF geographies for Huntington in that space and then also in business banking, I would say. So again, it's hard to make a comparison, other than say, we are seeing those trends manifest then and it's encouraging. As I said before, our focus is making sure that this is not hot money. These are really core accounts. We often use treasury as sort of the -- treasury management as the tip of the spear to really drive penetration of not only those capabilities and those services, but ultimately to cement those operating accounts in terms of the strategy. So that's the trends we're seeing. We feel confident about that forecast. Steve Steinour : Brian, we've had optimal customer relationship or OCR approaches to deepening or cross sell for more than a decade now. And the TCF business lines did not. They just didn't have the capabilities. So there's a broad base of customers that we have access to the edge that we put in place the data tool for the commercial teams and that we put that in place in the fourth quarter. That's given us a lot of insight and traction coming on that overall OCR strategy. So, good execution by the teams. We also shared over the fourth quarter -- third quarter call, if I remember correctly, that we were using an investment portal with one of our partners, to move some of the deposits off balance sheet with the view that we bring some of them back on as rate cycle change, and we'll do that as well. So those may be some of the contributing factors in addition to what Zach shared. Thank you for the question. Brian Foran : If maybe I could squeeze in one on capital, and it's as much an industry question is Huntington specific. But I guess the tangible common equity ratio matter at all this cycle. I mean, it's certainly getting lower for you and a lot of peers than it has been in a long time. But driven by rates, AOCI is kind of a funky concept. It fair values one line item, not any other. Is it just solely about the CET1 ratio? Is there any level of TCE ratio that you view as a floor? Should we care about the TCE ratio at all, I guess, is the crux of the question? Steve Steinour : Brian, in 2008 and 2009, that was the only ratio that we cared about, right? So -- but the industry clearly has migrated to CET1. It's surprising to me your question is the first one is probably a decade path of this nature. And we're obviously focused on it as well. That's why we have a fairly high HCM percentage of the investment portfolio. We've done certain other actions, including the hedging that Zach described today. And we'll continue to look at that, but it does not appear to be a driver. It does not come up at regulatory conversations. So it would seem that the investment community and the regulatory community both moved on to CET1. Brian Foran : That's great. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for today will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter Winter : Thanks. I just had a quick follow-up question on indirect auto. If you could talk a little bit about the outlook for indirect auto, some of the peers are pulling back because of the loan pricing pressures. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are? Steve Steinour : We really like that asset class, and we've been with it in and out of cycles. It is a short duration paper on average, as Zach shared earlier, 25 months weighted average life. So even in rising rates, it gets a little tighter and declining rates, the spread looks great. We're with it. We will stay with it on a consistent basis, and that's part of the value to the dealers. And so we have shown in the past a relative premium pricing for the -- as a consequence of the consistency in the market. We believe we're still achieving that, and we like the asset a lot. It will narrow a bit in terms of spreads in a rising rate environment, but it's a short-lived asset and it's still better than many of the alternatives. As you heard from Rich, we're confident in the performance. So this is, from our perspective, a good asset of 1-plus ROA asset historically. And our dealers, our auto dealers technically the deepest cross-sell total relationship cross-sell that we have in the company. Peter Winter : Got it. Thanks, Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Peter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : So thank you very much for joining us today. We're very proud of our colleagues, and I want to thank them for their commitment to driving results in a great quarter. We have a lot of confidence in our teams and what we can deliver for our customers and especially our shareholders over the course of 2022 as you heard. I appreciate very much your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing today can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As reminder, this call is being recorded, and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A portion, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks, and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks Tim. Good morning and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. Our outstanding second quarter results reflect momentum across the bank as we completed the integration of TCF. While 2022 continues to bring its own set of unique challenges, our businesses are performing very well. Overall, the companies in our markets are in good shape and continue to evidence demand for loans to support business investment and expansion. Consumers are generally maintaining liquidity. Much of the government and municipal stimulus funds are yet to be invested. Importantly, Huntington and the banking industry remain very well-positioned to withstand the current volatility. Now on to slide four. First, our performance in the second quarter was exceptional, with record net income and PPNR. Our focused execution is driving these robust results and leading returns. Loan growth continued in the quarter as we saw higher balances in nearly every portfolio across our commercial and consumer businesses. Higher loan growth paired with the benefit from higher interest rates contributed to expanded net interest income. Second, we're pleased to deliver average deposit growth quarter-over-quarter in our commercial and consumer businesses. The focus remains on growing primary bank relationships, while maintaining a disciplined deposit pricing strategy. Third, we achieved our target for core expenses below the $1 billion level as we completed the TCF cost synergy program. Fourth, we delivered on our medium-term financial goals this quarter earlier than previously guided. Finally, we posted record low net charge-offs this quarter and overall credit quality remains exceptional. This reflects our disciplined approach to customer selection and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite through the cycle. While we acknowledge the potential for uncertainty, to-date, we are not seeing substantive areas of concern within our loan portfolios. On slide five, let me share more detail on our second quarter performance. Robust loan growth, higher net interest income, and expense reductions supported our record PPNR, which increased 17% from the prior quarter. Average loan balances, excluding PPP, grew 10% on an annualized basis and are tracking to our expectations. While growing deposits, we are maintaining deposit pricing discipline in the face of a rising rate environment. We were also honored to be once again recognized by J.D. Power for the number one mobile app amongst regional banks. This marks the fourth consecutive year earning the top rank. Last month, we announced the formation of an enterprise-wide payments organization, led by a dedicated payments executive. This initiative reflects our strategic priority to accelerate our payments capabilities, expand the services we provide to our customers and drive additional fee revenues. In May, we announced the acquisition of Torana, now known as Huntington Choice Pay, which is a payment business focused on providing business to consumer payment services. On the commercial side, we continue to see traction in our treasury management initiatives with revenues growing 12% annualized this quarter. On the consumer side, we launched an enhanced cash back credit card offering late in the first quarter and results so far have exceeded our expectations. We are driving organic growth opportunities by providing enhanced product offerings to the TCF customer base and growing share of wallet. We completed the acquisition of Capstone last month, which adds a top-tier middle market investment bank and advisory firm bolstering our capital markets capabilities. We are pleased with the early contribution from our new colleagues, who added $4 million of capital market fees in the last two weeks of the quarter post closing. Looking forward, we see significant revenue synergies within our customer base as well. Turning to slide 6. We extended our track record of modeled credit outperformance in the recent CCAR stress test results. This year's process included the acquired TCF loan portfolios and the results did not materially change our model performance relative to peers. This highlighted the robust credit strength of Huntington's balance sheet, which has continued to outperform peer median benchmarks in every CCAR cycle since 2015. Finally, I want to highlight the accomplishments of the TCF combination. It's been just over a year since we closed on the acquisition. And since then, we've delivered on the commitments we shared at announcement. We closed quickly in under six months and converted systems just four months later. We delivered the cost synergies earlier than guided. The pace of digital investment spend has doubled from the prior run rate, accelerating our digital initiatives. We've delivered leading financial performance, which is evident in our results this quarter. Finally, we are capturing incremental opportunities from the addition of key markets and capabilities through our revenue synergy initiatives. Over the past year, we've added over 50 revenue-producing colleagues in Minnesota and Colorado to support wealth management, business banking, middle market and specialty banking. The middle market teams in the Twin Cities and Denver are growing relationships, increasing loans and deposit production. We're also seeing increased productivity from the acquired branches and a positive reception to the Huntington product offerings and customer service experience. Our business banking expansion in the Twin Cities and Denver is also showing substantial momentum, where we are pleased to have already achieved a top five ranking for SBA lending in both markets. We've seen early traction from our wealth management launch in the Twin Cities with AUM building year-to-date. As a result of this success, we've replicated that approach in Denver, and we've hired an experienced leader and other new colleagues to build out our capabilities. As for our inventory and equipment finance businesses, the teams continue to capitalize on the opportunities to harness the combined scale to better serve our clients. Today, we are the seventh largest bank-owned national platform, and I expect that ranking to increase based on the momentum we are experiencing. These initiatives are ongoing, and we expect them to contribute to our growth over multiple years. We are well positioned to grow shareholder value. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide eight provides highlights of our second quarter results. We reported earnings per common share of $0.35. Adjusted for notable items, earnings per common share were $0.36. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 19.9% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 20.6%. We were pleased to see sustained momentum in our loan balances with total loans increasing by $2.8 billion. And excluding PPP, loans increased by $3.3 billion. Total average deposits also increased, with growth in both consumer and commercial balances. Pre-provision net revenue expanded sequentially and grew 17% from last quarter. Consistent with our plan, we reduced core expenses below our target of $1 billion, driven by the realization of cost synergies. Credit quality was exceptional, with record low net charge-offs of 3 basis points and nonperforming assets reduced to 59 basis points. Slide nine shows our continued trajectory of PPNR expansion. We see 2022 coming together quite well, as we drive sustainable profitability and highlight the earnings power of the company, supported by our organic growth initiatives and harnessing the benefits from the TCF acquisition. We remain committed to our long track record of managing to positive operating leverage, with disciplined expense management, even as we continue to invest in the business. Turning to slide 10. Average loan balances increased 2.5% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $113.9 billion. Excluding PPP, total loan balances increased $3.3 billion or 3%, driven by commercial and consumer loans. Within commercial, excluding PPP, average loans increased by $2 billion or 3.3% from the prior quarter. These results were supported by broad-based demand across commercial lending that is driving robust new production. Line utilization remained relatively stable during the quarter on a core C&I basis, while we saw higher balances within our inventory finance business. Commercial growth was led by middle market, corporate and specialty banking, which collectively increased by $746 million during the quarter. Asset finance contributed meaningfully with balances higher by $497 million. Inventory finance continues to rebuild towards a more normalized level, with average balances up $383 million during the quarter. Commercial real estate balances also increased by $213 million. Auto dealer floor plan balances were relatively stable, increasing by $45 million, as supply chain constraints continue to dampen inventory levels. In Consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $1 billion, driven by slower prepays and higher mix of on-balance sheet loan production. We also saw steady growth in RV/Marine and indirect auto. Average home equity balances declined by $41 million. However, we were pleased to see end-of-period balance growth, driven by robust new production of first-lien refinance products. Turning to slide 11. We delivered average deposit growth of $2.1 billion. Deposit growth was led by commercial, with deposits up $2.1 billion, while consumer balances increased by $500 million from the prior quarter. This growth reflects our initiatives to drive primary bank relationships and new customer acquisition across the bank. We remain disciplined on deposit pricing, with our total cost of deposits coming in at just 7 basis points for the second quarter. On slide 12, we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and NIM. Core net interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, increased by $125 million or 11% to $1.244 billion. Consistent with our prior guidance, net interest margin increased driven by higher earning asset yields as a result of our asset sensitivity position and lower Fed cash balances. Slide 13 highlights Huntington's deposit pricing discipline. We have a long history of managing through cycles, and we believe our deposit base today is even stronger, than it was starting the last tightening cycle. For the second quarter, we have seen little change to our average cost of deposits, given the timing of rapid Fed rate moves occurring later in the quarter. That said, we are remaining dynamic in this environment. We are managing the portfolio at a very granular and segmented level, client by client in many cases, to ensure pricing discipline and growing the primary bank relationships to bring lower-cost operational deposits. Turning to Slide 14. We are managing the balance sheet in order to position ourselves to benefit from higher expected rates in the short-term, while also being judicious on managing possible downside rate risks over the longer term. We continued to execute on our hedging strategy during the second quarter, and increased our downside protection by executing a net $3.3 billion of received fixed swaps. Our expectation is to continue to add to this hedging program during the third quarter. Additionally, we are managing the securities portfolio to both capture the benefit from higher rates over time, as well as protect capital. We increased the proportion of securities and held to maturity during the quarter and our reinvesting securities portfolio cash flows at rates well above portfolio yields. Moving to Slide 15. Non-interest income was $485 million, up $41 million year-over-year and down $14 million from last quarter. We saw record activity, within our capital markets business during the quarter, which drove revenues up $12 million from prior quarter. Additionally, we saw expansion in our cards and payments revenues and deposit service charges. Fee revenues were impacted this quarter by lower gain on sale from SBA loan sales, as we sold less balances in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. Recall, we restarted our normal SBA loan sales earlier this year. And while loan production remains robust, this quarter's gain on sale is generally aligned to our go-forward expectations. Fees were also impacted by a decline in mortgage banking as volumes continue to normalize from the exceptionally strong levels seen last year and due to lower saleable spreads. While we are pleased with the sales and client engagement traction in our Wealth Management business, we saw lower overall revenues as market-based AUM changes outweighed continued momentum in net asset flows. Moving on to Slide 16. Non-interest expense declined $35 million from the prior quarter. Excluding notable items, core expenses, declined by $13 million to $994 million as we completed the cost savings from the acquisition and achieved our targeted expense level. Our efficiency ratio, which is an outcome of our revenue drivers and expense management activities, came in at 57% on a reported basis, and adjusted for notable items was 56% for the quarter, in line with our medium-term target.  Slide 17, recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.1% and within our target operating range of 9% to 10%. As we go forward, our capital priorities remain unchanged with our first priority to fund organic loan growth. Our expectation is that given the strong sustained levels of loan growth, buybacks will be de minimis, if any, for the remainder of the year. With the robust return on equity we are generating, we expect to be able to fund this organic growth and see capital ratios move higher over the balance of 2022. Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, declined to 5.8%, as a result of AOCI marks on the securities portfolio. Recall, this is an accounting construct that temporarily reduces equity as value marks are taken and then reverses over time and this does not impact our regulatory capital ratios. Our TCE ratio, excluding the AOCI impact has been relatively stable near 7% level. Finally, our dividend yield remains number one in our peer group at 5%. On Slide 18, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were a record low of 3 basis points, benefiting from another quarter of net recoveries in commercial portfolios and continued stability in consumer credit quality. Non-performing assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced each of the last four quarters. We also saw lower criticized loans, which have improved both from the prior quarter and prior year. Allowance for credit losses was flat at 1.87% of total loans, reflecting a conservative reserve posture, given the heightened economic uncertainty even as our internal portfolio metrics show stability. We are proud to report on Slide 19 that we have achieved our medium-term goals. Since sharing these targets, we have been intently focused on executing on our commitments and managing dynamically through the changing environment. We have been guiding that we were as expected reflect these goals by the second half of 2022. We have now achieved these results one quarter ahead of schedule. This performance represents the earnings power of the franchise. The TCF acquisition bolstered many of these areas and allowed us to gain incremental scale and profitability, as Steve mentioned earlier. And the incremental growth momentum is only just the beginning. As we stand today, we believe our return on capital is compelling compared to our peer set and demonstrates the financial rigor with which we operate that is focused on creating fundamental value for shareholders. Finally, turning to Slide 20. Let me update our outlook. Our guidance assumes the consensus economic outlook through 2022, and it incorporates the rate curve as of the end of June. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged. As a result of our balance sheet growth and the rate curve outlook, we are again revising guidance higher for net interest income. We now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, to grow in the high teens to low 20s percent range. In fee income, we continue to expect growth between low and mid-single digits for the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. We are continuing to see encouraging trends in our payments, capital markets and wealth and advisory businesses. As we shared previously, our guidance incorporates the normalization of mortgage banking revenues and the fair play enhancements we are making over the course of the second half of the year. Note, our guidance fully captures the expected benefits of our Capstone Partners and Torana acquisitions, which closed in the second quarter. On expenses, we are pleased to have completed the cost savings program. We are balancing continued momentum in the business and strong revenue growth with the uncertainty around the near-term macro outlook and inflationary pressures that are affecting the economy. The strong revenue performance of the business will drive a degree of associated compensation expenses in addition to targeted investments to support key growth initiatives. Hence, our expectation is for core expenses, excluding Capstone Partners and Torana to grow at a modest level for the balance of 2022. Additionally, Capstone and Torana will add incremental expenses of approximately $25 million beginning in the third quarter run rate. Finally, given our continued exceptional credit performance, we are revising our full year net charge-offs down to less than 15 basis points from approximately 20 basis points previously. That concludes our opening remarks. Tim, let's open up the call for Q&A, please. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Steve Steinour : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. I want to see if you could maybe comment on your deposit growth expectation? How you're thinking about the ability to grow deposits here and possibly the makeup of that of that growth? I know you didn't include that in your formal guidance. So maybe if you could just kind of help us think about how we should model the growth. Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Absolutely. Thanks, John. This is Zach. I'll take that one. I think just taking it to back, we were pleased to see the deposits continue to expand in the second quarter, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we guided that we would have that expectation and we were pleased to see it come through and be delivered. The outlook going forward continues to be for modest growth. Commercial growing faster, consumer might be flat to down a bit. The environment is clearly volatile here with the rate moves we've seen out of late, but that's the traction we're seeing and so far it's corroborated here just in the first few weeks of July. The focus we've got is really deepening, engagement with our clients growing, core operating count certainly within the commercial business, primary bank relationships broadly across the franchise and really balancing that growth with pricing over time, clearly, but that's the growth we've got for now. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks. And then related to that, maybe could you just elaborate a bit on your deposit beta expectations in terms of how they begin to -- how they could trend in the back half  your terminal beta ultimately? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. I'll take that one again as well. So thus far in the cycle, it's been pretty limited in terms of pricing changes that we've seen come through. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks, average deposit cost for Q2 just 4 basis points higher than Q1, so very low. That represents less than 10% beta. With that being said, clearly, the rate has happened late in the quarter in May and then more in June and given the forecast for July, we do expect Q3 and Q4 to be higher. As we take a step back and just think about this cycle, it's clearly changing and there are factors that are driving beta to be higher than we be the last rate hiking cycle. We started from a lower starting point. Asset growth continues to be pretty strong here across the industry, and these multiple more than 25 basis point rate moves that are happening quick succession are clearly up factors for beta. With that being said, we do think more to continue to recognize the level of excess liquidity across the entire industry at this point is quite high. And inflation itself tends to increase balances over time as that filters into wages and corporate revenues. Take it to back still very early in the cycle. Our posture is to be very, very disciplined and manage this with a lot of rigor at a very detailed level as we noted before and with that primary bank focus. And I think everything we're seeing thus far and the incremental forecasting that we do on a monthly basis continues to cooperate that were on the trend that we were expecting. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. How you are doing? Steve Steinour : Good morning, Betsy. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to just get a sense on how you're thinking about the buyback resumption, what the parameters would be and what you're looking at to turn that back on? Zach Wasserman : Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll take that as well. As we talked about in the prepared remarks for Q2, we didn't do any buybacks given the Capstone acquisition closing. And I think as we think about the next several set of quarters, our capital priorities are really guided by our overall party sets and first and foremost, to fund organic growth and given the strong ROE that we get on the organic loans we're bringing in, that's our top priority. That's where we intended, and I'm really pleased to be able to allocate the capital. Even as we also manage capital ratios upward here, trending towards the year-end. It's a little too early to call what happens in 2023. And as we get closer, we'll have a better view of what the plan might be at that point. But I think you'll see us tick capital ratios up here sequentially and deploy it to the loan growth for the foreseeable future. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then you talked a bit already about the credit and what's going on with the corporate side. Could you give us a sense on the consumer book, what you're seeing? Is there any differentiation at all between either FICO bands, income bands or whether or not you're housing, you're a homeowner or a renter? Any dynamics there would be helpful. Thanks. Rich Pohle : Hey, Betsy, it's Rich. I can take that one. On the consumer side, we see as we've talked about in some of the previous calls, just a little bit of increasing in the delinquencies just in many respects because they've been running at such artificially low levels given the deferral business \u00e2\u0080\u0093 deferrals in 2020 and the stimulus in 2021. I would say in general, though, those books are performing very well. We have maintained our FICO disciplines across the board. And with increasing auto pricing and increasing home rates, we've also done a good job of keeping the loan to values constant or coming down. So we feel very good about where the consumer book is positioned right now. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Steve Steinour : Betsy, this is Steve. We put the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we published our auto lending every quarter. So you see new lending at super prime, it just hasn't deviated more than 5 or 10 points and has generally drifted upwards over the last 12 years. And we're super prime on the home side as well. And then the RV/Marine is an average just over 800 like an FICO. All of this is very low to fault frequency, default expectation and it's all secured. So we feel very good about the consumer book as a whole. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning everybody. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : So for Zach, somewhat of a theoretical question. So if we look at the balance sheet, the loan-to-deposit ratio is low, which is keeping deposit betas very low at the moment. You're hedging to stabilize loan yields. When we think about incremental loan beta versus incremental deposit beta, this is for you and the industry, are we basically setting up where as we look out to 2023, the full year NIM could be higher in 2023, just mechanically over 2022. But at some point, we should expect your quarter-over-quarter NIM to start trending down through the year as deposit betas ultimately catch up? Zach Wasserman : Well, first of all, thanks for serving me of a theoretical question. I'd love to take those. Appreciate you doing that. Look, I think that our outlook in best forecast that I see is for continued NIM expansion over the next few quarters. And if you sort of stretch the forecast out, if you use the forward yield curve as guidance, that continues out into the middle part of 2023. That starts to stabilize. My forecast doesn't show contraction of anything material, just more bouncing a lot of flat line as you get kind of further out into time. Obviously, you noted in your question that I quipped about it, it is a little theoretical, so you start to forecast on forecast on forecasting you got to move too far. But that's the expectation that we've got. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Got it. And in response to John's question, I just want to understand your answer. You said you thought your deposit beta could be higher this cycle than the prior cycle, is that right? Zach Wasserman : No, that's not what I said. I think generally continue to be tracking around the same level at the last cycle. I think it's -- the beta sort of trends over time. That was the point I was trying to make. Initially in the early stages of the cycle, it's quite low. And that's certainly what we saw in the second quarter less than 10% beta in the second quarter. I think the beta will accelerate as the rate environment and cycle continues. But in totality on a cumulative basis, still seeing generally the same kind of trends and outlooks as we had seen in the last cycle. Steven Alexopoulos : In the last -- okay, got it. Thanks. And then for Steve. So there's quite a bit of talk about companies onshoring supply chains, right, back to the US. I'm curious what you're seeing on the ground? I'm not really talking about the Intel plant, but beyond that, is this something that you're starting to see or is this just really a talking point at this point? Thanks. Steve Steinour : Steven, it's occurring. It's been occurring. I think, if anything, what we're even seeing this year with China shutdown episodically with COVID, it's just reinforcing. So it's supply chain nearshore or onshore and we're getting some of that benefit here in the Midwest and I suspect probably in the Southeast Southwest as well. I think that's going to continue. The supply chains have gotten better in some industries, but still in most are a problem. And that level of investment required is reflected in our equipment finance results. We've had a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we had a record second quarter and expect to have a very strong second half. Usually, our second half is better than the first half. So, the teams are seeing a lot of investment. Reshoring is certainly a meaningful portion of it. Zach Wasserman : And the other thing I just -- this is Zach. The other kind of secular phenomenon, but I do think it's going to be a tailwind for the industry broadly for the commercial banking space in the investment in property plant equipment to deal with labor supply constraints, which aren't going away anytime soon and are really driving significant corporate level investments in automation technology things of that nature. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Hey good morning. Noticing the strong loan growth this quarter overall and keeping the guide for the year, as I put through the slide deck, I noticed that the originations on some of the consumer buckets are understandably smaller than they had been. I just want to ask you to flush out again, as you think forward about commercial growth versus consumer growth, are there any changes you guys are making in either underwriting criteria or what you want to put on the books? And how do you expect commercial versus consumer growth to look going forward overall? Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Sure. This is Zach. I'll take that, and I'll see if my colleagues want to tack on throughout the course of answering your question. Generally, as I noted and your question, we continue to expect high single-digit loan growth by Q4. We're actually running above that level right now. Q2 was about a 10% annualized, which gives us the opportunity to optimize our capital allocation and really dial in the long-term return of the asset growth as we go throughout the balance of the yield which we feel really good about to be in that position. The nature of the growth going forward will be pretty similar to what we've seen in the first half of this year, that is commercial led, driven by production and consumer growing, but slower. And I think it's corroborated by what we're seeing in the -- particularly the commercial loan pipelines up. I don't think we mentioned a 9% quarter-over-quarter, 33% year-over-year in our late-stage commercial pipeline. So notwithstanding the economic headlines, our clients are still investing. There's still opportunity to grow. On the consumer side, we're going to see slower growth in residential mortgage than we saw in the first half, as we go into the second half and auto and RV/Marine continue to contribute, although at a slower level. So, I think perhaps a modest shift toward commercial, but generally pretty similar to the nature of growth we saw in the first half. Steve Steinour : And I'll just tack on a little bit. With mortgage rates up, refi volumes down, you see in the mortgage numbers everywhere. But \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so some of the home lending, at least on the mortgage side, will be maybe partially offset with . But the consumer side, I think, will tend to be a little less robust than it has been. At the same time, the sheer scale and the opportunities we have in these national businesses with TCF are really extraordinary. So, the inventory finance is like number two to one of the big four nationally, and that just has great upside for us as supply chains get worked out. We've talked before about all the floor plan, that's almost a $2 billion number for us as it normalizes. So, there's opportunity a bit in the utilization rate changes. We saw a little bit of that in the second quarter. There's a lot of opportunity utilization rate changes. But the growth dynamics here in these national businesses and new markets are very, very good. We've got over 50 new business colleagues in Minnesota and Colorado, as I mentioned earlier, and that activity is bearing fruit and will continue to be a source of growth for us as well. So very well-positioned. Zach gave you the close in pipeline as of a contemporary week, but the total commercial pipeline almost doubled what it was a year ago. So a lot of opportunity in front of us. Ken Usdin : Got it. Great. Thank you, Steve. And then just one more follow-up, just drill that into auto. Just some peers -- and this isn't new, some peers are saying that things are getting tougher on spreads and it pulled the way you guys tend to get that premium to the market. And just with the changing dynamics going on in terms of residual values and new versus used mix, can you just talk about some of the dynamics there in terms of the ability to continue to produce and originate at the same level and how you're expecting credit to act as well underneath? Thank you. Steve Steinour : The credit, we think will have a very consistent performance because we've been so disciplined for more than a decade. So we don't expect to see any significant credit issues emerging out of auto or RV/Marine for that matter because that's an 8, 10-plus average FICO. So very, very low to full frequencies. And that drives more than valuation -- used car valuation or other equivalent metrics, much more to our business line that it evolves because we just -- frankly, we just don't have that many repossessions. As we think about the business going forward, there's always a lag as rates rise in terms of getting pricing at a typical level and there's always a benefit as rates fall. So we're dynamically pricing. We're actually -- we don't focus on market share. It's about return and risk, and we'll continue to do that. But we've been in this business for almost three quarters with century has performed very, very well for us, and we expect it will continue to do so. Thanks for your Ken. Tim Sedabres : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Zach Wasserman : Ebrahim, how are you? Ebrahim Poonawala : Good. Hi, Zach. Just wanted to follow-up on your expense guide. Two-part question. One, as we think about your strategic target, 56% efficiency ratio, just talk to us in terms of areas of investments as we look forward from here and where you're flexing expenses in terms of savings and whether there is a case to be made that the efficiency ratio normalized for whatever rate backdrop could be structurally lower than your current target? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Thanks for the question. There's a lot to unpack in expenses. So you gave me the opportunity to do that. I think now that we have delivered the cost synergies fully, it's in the run rate we're back to managing expenses on an ongoing basis as the business grows and with a goal toward continuing to drive positive operating leverage and modulating expenses relative to revenue. While we self fund the key investments in our strategic initiatives to sustain them and those are not changed from what we've had before. We continue to build out key commercial capabilities, build our critical fee businesses and payments, capital markets, wealth, and I think continue to build terrific digital and overall product capabilities within our consumer and business banking function. So, those are the priorities. We'll keep investing in them align with clearly what Steve was just mentioning in terms of the terrific momentum we have in the TCF expansion opportunities. The efficiency ratio is an outcome, frankly. And our goal is really in the end, drive PPNR and just continue to expand profitability over time. With that being said, I do think efficiency ratio could very well trend lower here just given where the rate environment is going, and we'll see where that goes. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just a separate question on -- in your slide deck, slide 35, you talked about digital engagement or originations, both consumer, commercial deposit originations seem to have peaked a few quarters ago and declined. Just wondering if anything to read in there and talk to us in terms of the investments you're making on the digital side from a client onboarding acquisition perspective? Zach Wasserman : Yes. So, I think in terms of the investments we're making in digital continue, and it's all about channel development, internal process efficiency. And we've got -- as we have had in the past, a series of interesting new product developments that are on our roadmap that I will feel a thunder on now, but you'll see them come through into the market over time as we launch them. We're always throttling the dials of where we're directing our marketing funding. And that changes the mix of online versus offline account acquisition over time. But in the end, it's all about driving the most value ultimately from the accounts in terms of depth of relationship and ultimately, customer lifetime value. So, -- and we feel really good where that is trending, frankly. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Zach Wasserman : Good morning Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Zach, a theoretical question for you, Zach. Do you feel like there's an upper limit on your margin. I've covered your company for a long time and I always think like 350-ish gets a little bit toppy on your margin. But is it possible to see similar types of sequential jumps in the margin if we get another 75 basis points next week, or is there something in your business mix that would prevent them? Zach Wasserman : If you see the room here, you're seeing a lot of heads nodding and pleasured with your questions, so thanks for asking it. I mean I think, look, the reality is that there is no top. It's a function of where the interest rate market goes, right? And I think it can go higher. With that being said, I think, realistically, what you're seeing kind of the realistic range is right for the foreseeable future. And certainly, as we do our modeling based on the yield curve where it is right now, we see continued expansion, as I mentioned in one of the questions earlier for the next few quarters and then beginning to flatten out as you get into kind of the middle part of 2023 and beyond, based on the trajectory of the yield curve right now. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. And then, Steve, a question for you, acquisition appetite. It's probably an annoying question, but you've done some fee businesses and I think you've done well with those. You've done well with TCF. You did fine with FirstMerit. Any interest at all in depositories, or is that just off the table, given the regulatory environment? Steve Steinour : We have a lot of opportunity to achieve with TCF. So, our expectation is just to continue to focus on that. And if there is some ancillary fee businesses that help us in payments or well for the capital markets, those would be of interest to us. But we've got a lot of upside going forward over the next couple of years. And I don't know, how to think about the regulatory environment for us. We got approved in record time the last time with TCF, and we had the same experience with FirstMerit and that should be some indication of our standing. And would be another indication of the outperformance every time above median is a reflection of the quality of the portfolio. So we're seeing outstanding and have been. So, all of that suggests we're able to do things, if we choose to, but our focus will continue to drive the revenue opportunity from the TCF combination. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Jon Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question David Long : Good morning, everyone. Steve Steinour : Good morning., David. David Long : The expected pre-pandemic Day one CECL reserve was lower -- much lower for legacy Huntington and even much lower for TCF than legacy Huntington given its shorter duration loan portfolio, than your current reserve level. So with the economic forecast at very healthy levels here, just wanted to see why maybe your reserve today is higher than where it was pre pandemic? Rich Pohle : The prepayment, I think you have to go back. I mean that's over two years ago. So it's a point in time. This is always a point in time. The portfolio has -- mix has shifted over time as well. We had a big oil and gas portfolio that was part of CECL Day one that's not anymore. We've got more real estate today than we had back then. So a lot of it is a function of just the makeup of the portfolio. And as we're sitting here today, we're looking potentially in a recession. I think if you went back to January of 2020, you didn't have that on the horizon, potentially near term. So it's a combination of everything. The mechanics of CECL is you look at it every quarter and you run your models and you make subjective adjustments where do you think the models might be of not capturing everything. And as we sit here, at the end of the second quarter, we had come down for six consecutive quarters prior to this one, and I just thought it was time to take a little bit of a pause and see where things shake out. So it's a quarter-by-quarter analysis we do. And it's really hard to go back to CECL Day one and say this is a goal or an objective to get there. David Long : Got it. Thanks for providing the color. And then Steve, you mentioned or talked a little bit about some of the revenue synergies with TCF. And I sense your excitement there, but is there any way you can put numbers behind it, either in incremental loan growth with any of the categories or level of dollars of revenue that you think can be created? Steve Steinour : Well, we haven't given guidance along those lines, David, but you're hearing us allude to it in terms of equipment finance, inventory finance, the reference as stated the TCF didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do SBA lending in Colorado or Minnesota. In fact, we didn't do C&I lending or small business lending in Colorado. So you get a lot -- for that matter well in either market. So there's a lot of investment that has made that early on is producing, and I think this gets bigger and better as we scale those businesses in those markets. And then we are a force in Michigan. We were having great growth in Michigan. And we're now able to run a full set of plays in Chicago. So you have those combinations of regional markets, our equipment finance, number seven nationally, I think will be better than that on a relative position by the end of the year based on the volumes we see. So we've got a lot of synergy that's been achieved. And we've been emphasizing OCR. We have a much better product set on both the consumer and commercial side, and that emphasis will continue to translate into revenue growth in capital markets, card and other businesses, the fee businesses for us, treasury management, et cetera, as we go forward. We'll give some thought to try to mention that over time for you and others. But at this point, we haven't done so. David Long : Great. Thank you. I appreciate the additional color Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks David. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please state your question. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just kind of follow-up question on how yields \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the yield trajectory. Zach, the increase in AFS yields was particularly eye-popping. Was that just a function of the starting point of 165 is just so low, or was there anything sort of more onetime in nature there? And additionally, I noticed that C&I yields were only up 5 bps in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you expect that loan beta to accelerate over the next few quarters? Zach Wasserman : Yeah. Nothing unusual in the first category you talked about. I think we're just seeing that continued trend through and certainly in our securities portfolio broadly really benefiting from expanding yields and just the reinvestment of the cash flows. Overall, broadly speaking across the loan categories, we're seeing nice trends in new money yield with gross yields really benefiting as the yield curve is expanding here. The environment is still competitive. And so it's still a factor, but we're seeing new money rates expand in almost every major product line across the board, around 30 bps to sense overall from Q1 to Q2. And I think that the average rate increase in Q2 versus Q1 was relatively modest. I think we're going to see coming through related to your C&I question in Q3 is more just given, again, the timing of the rate moves and the moves and so for late in the quarter versus what we'll see on average for Q3. Erika Najarian : Got it. Okay. And just a follow-up question. Clearly, the market has priced in, started to price in a mild downturn, some downturn over the near-term. Could you remind us when you printed an ACL ratio of 222 in 2020, what kind of unemployment rate were you assuming then? And if we think about a mild downturn over the next six to 12 months, how much more will your ACL ratio climb from what seems to already be a pretty nice level of 187? Steve Steinour : Yeah. I mean as it relates to where we were a couple of years ago, I'd have to go back and take that out. I would just say that we use multiple scenarios and each one is going to have embedded assumptions around GDP and unemployment. So -- and those are going to run a pretty wide range. But it's the mix, the weighted average of all those that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Zach Wasserman : This is Zach, just tack on. I would not draw sort of a direct correlation in that way. I think there's, just too many other factors that go into it. And I think that it's not even necessarily the case that it would go up. I think it really depends on, I think, what the trajectory is and what the outlook is across the various scenarios also clearly that the depth and duration of any economic softening is the most important factor. Steve Steinour : Well. And I think the other thing that you have to look at is the, with CECL, it's really hard to predict where the actual level of reserves is going to go because not only is that a function of the portfolio, but it's also a function of loan growth. So you've got to build that in. So this quarter, we kept the ACL coverage flat, but the dollars, the allowance built because of the loan growth we experienced. So, there's a few moving pieces in there. But I would say entering into a potential downturn with a position of strength, we would think would mitigate any large increases going forward. Erika Najarian : Thank you so much. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Hey guys. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Scott. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. Scott Siefers : Hey. I was hoping you might be able to sort of update your thoughts on the revenue contributions from Capstone and Torana. And I know you had the $4 million contribution from Capstone in the second quarter. I think the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Zach Wasserman : Yeah. Scott Siefers : \u00e2\u0080\u00a6disclosures you offered previously on that one in particular were based on prior year's performance. So just any updated thoughts now that they're officially under the umbrella? Zach Wasserman : Yeah. So thanks for the question, Scott. And just we couldn't be more pleased about closing both of those acquisitions. Torana is relatively small. Capstone is a very, scaled business as we've talked about. And just an amazing fit for our capital markets business and not only bring on a great run rate, but the opportunity to expand that business within the Huntington franchise is really, really significant. So we're thrilled about it. At this point, our current forecasts are around that same kind of run rate here over the next couple of quarters. And I think we'll see the synergies start to manifest as we get out further into time, but really excited about that. I think Torana over time will grow a relatively small impact in this year. Steve Steinour : So, Scott, I think Zach gave you like a $100 million three-year average revenue. Zach Wasserman : Correct. Steve Steinour : And that's the reference point to your question. I would tell you they have a very good pipeline for the third quarter, and they had a good second quarter. And as we integrate and bring them into our customer base, we've nailed then we've worked together. This is a really good cultural fit. We'll look to grow revenues off that base. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thanks Zach Wasserman : It's around the $30 million run rate is roughly we're at. Scott Siefers : Okay. You said $30 million run rate? Zach Wasserman : Third quarter. Yes. Scott Siefers : Third quarter. Perfect. Okay. Good. Thank you very much. Operator : Our final question comes from David Konrad with KBW. Please state your question. David Konrad : Hey, actually, Erika already asked my question. So I guess, we're all wrapped up. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thanks. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Well, we know you've had a busy morning. So, thank you very much for joining us today. It was just a tremendous quarter for us in Huntington. We're obviously pleased with the results, but we're also pleased with the momentum that we have going into the third quarter, coming off of record net income and PPNR growth. We're well positioned, we believe, to manage through the current uncertain economic outlook. We remain committed to and are confident of our ability to continue driving value for our shareholders. Just as a reminder, the Board executives and our colleagues are a top 10 shareholder collectively, reflecting our strong alignment with shareholders. So thank you for your interest and support today. And have a great one. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be referencing today can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A portion, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We are extremely pleased to announce our third quarter results, which reflected adjusted net income of $575 million and represented another quarter of record earnings for the company. We continue to execute on our plan for 2022 and the business is performing very well despite macroeconomic uncertainties. We are seeing sustained demand from customers across the footprint, which is reflected in the robust pipelines and our growth trends. We are closely monitoring economic developments and continue to believe we are operating from a position of strength as we head into the fourth quarter and 2023. Now on to Slide 4. First, the performance in the third quarter was exceptional with our third consecutive quarter of record PPNR. Loan growth continued to be broad-based and combined with the benefit from higher interest rates, net interest income again expanded at a double-digit rate from the prior quarter and fee income also expanded sequentially. As a result of these factors, adjusted PPNR increased by 14% in the quarter. This performance was driven by execution of our revenue producing initiatives and reflected our continued disciplined expense management. Second, we delivered another quarter of sequential growth in average deposits driven by commercial. Third, we were pleased to drive double-digit annualized loan growth again this quarter. With this robust loan momentum and continued pipeline strength, we are optimizing asset growth at the margin to maximize the return profile as we enter the fourth quarter. Fourth, we are increasing our revenue and profitability guidance to incorporate the recent rate curve outlook. Zach will provide you with more details on that later. Finally, we are positioned very well for potential economic uncertainty with balance sheet strength, including higher capital levels and a reserve profile that is near the top of the peer group. Additionally, our profitability and return on capital outlook is expected to continue to support further building capital ratios. This places Huntington in a position of strength with an outlook that will continue to be guided by our disciplined approach to customer selection and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite through the cycle. On Slide 5, let me share more details on our third quarter performance. As I mentioned earlier, we reported record net income, which reflects our earnings power and ability to generate sustained top-tier returns. We have positioned the company to benefit from higher interest rates with our asset sensitivity, and we continue to grow our fee income businesses. This level of robust revenue supports our continued investment in key strategic initiatives, which will sustain growth. Importantly, we remain committed to our disciplined expense management and guided by our commitment to positive operating leverage. Finally, as we previously delivered on the TCF integration program and cost savings, we remain focused on driving the incremental revenue opportunities from the acquisition. Let me provide a few updates on our progress to-date. We've added over 60 revenue-producing colleagues in Minnesota and Colorado to support wealth management, business banking, middle market and specialty banking. The commercial teams in the Twin Cities in Denver are continuing to gain traction, adding new customers and building pipelines. In addition to the expanding middle market teams, we are seeing accelerated loan growth in some of our specialty areas such as, health care and asset-based lending, where we have recently closed a handful of sizable new relationships in Colorado as a function of our expertise and local presence. We are also driving increased productivity from the acquired branches where we have grown primary banking relationships nearly every month since conversion. We believe this demonstrates relationship deepening and a positive reception to the Huntington product offerings. Our business banking expansion in Minnesota and Colorado is also showing substantial momentum. We're pleased to have already achieved the top three ranking or better for SBA lending, which were start-ups in both markets. The launch of Wealth Management in the Twin Cities continues to track better than our initial projections. The team has been fully built out, and we are pleased with the caliber of talent we were able to add in this market. While it's still early, the team is already contributing to relationship growth. Building pipelines reflect a significant customer opportunity even against a difficult market backdrop. Based on early successes we are seeing in the Twin Cities, we've expanded the wealth management business to Denver with key hires added during the third quarter. In our Asset Finance business, which includes equipment finance and distribution finance, which was formerly known as inventory finance, our teams continue to capitalize on the opportunities to harness the combined scale to better serve our customers. The business is significantly benefiting from that scale, driving increased momentum in client acquisition and deepening of existing relationships. We are now the fifth largest bank-owned equipment finance platform in the US, an increase from number seven only a year ago. These initiatives are ongoing, and we expect them to be a significant contributor to our growth over the longer term. We look forward to our Investor Day next month when we can spend more time on our overall business strategies as well as how these TCF revenue synergies factor into our consolidated outlook. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides highlights of our third quarter results. We reported GAAP and adjusted earnings per common share of $0.39. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE, came in at 21.9% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 22.2%. As you saw on slide 4, if you were to normalize TCE for the non-cash accounting impact of other accumulated comprehensive income that arises from unrealized losses on our AFS securities portfolio, our ROTCE would have been 18.6%. We are pleased with the sustained momentum in our loan balances, with total loans increasing by $3 billion and excluding PPP, loans increasing by $3.3 billion. Total average deposits also increased $1 billion quarter-over-quarter and $3.7 billion year-over-year. This growth reflects the focus on primary bank relationships. Pre-provision net revenue expanded sequentially by 17% from last quarter to $857 million. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 15 basis points and non-performing assets declining to 53 basis points. Slide 8 shows our continued trajectory of PPNR expansion. We expect Q4 to be another strong quarter as we drive sustainable profitability and highlight the earnings power of the company, supported by organic growth initiatives and harnessing the benefits from the TCF acquisition. We remain committed to our long track record of managing to positive operating leverage even as we continue to invest in the business. Turning to slide 9. Average loan balances increased 2.6% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $117 billion. Excluding PPP, total loan balances increased $3.3 billion, or 2.9% driven by both commercial and consumer loans. Within commercial, excluding PPP, average loans increased by $2 billion or 3.3% from the prior quarter. These results were supported by broad-based demand across our commercial businesses that is fueling robust new production. Line utilization remained relatively stable during the quarter on a core C&I basis, while we saw higher balances within distribution finance. Asset Finance, which includes equipment finance and distribution finance, contributed with balances higher by $1 billion. This included $300 million from distribution finance during the quarter. Commercial real estate balances also increased by $800 million. Commercial growth continued in our middle market, corporate and specialty banking segments, which collectively increased by $200 million during the quarter. In Consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $1 billion, driven by slowing prepays and higher mix of on-balance sheet loan production. We also saw steady growth in our vehicle finance business. Turning to slide 10. We delivered average deposit growth of $1 billion. Deposit growth was led by commercial, up $1.4 billion. This expansion reflects our initiatives to drive primary bank relationships and new customer acquisition. We remain disciplined on deposit pricing, with our total cost of deposits coming in at 25 basis points for the third quarter. On slide 11, we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and NIM. Core net interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, increased by $148 million, or 12% to $1.392 billion. Net interest margin increased primarily driven by higher earning asset yields as a result of our asset sensitivity position. Slide 12 highlights Huntington's deposit pricing discipline. Our low deposit rate relative to the third quarter of 2015 along with an improved funding profile gives us the flexibility to remain disciplined on deposit pricing. For the third quarter, we have started to see our average cost of deposits tick-up as expected. We are remaining dynamic in this environment. We continue to manage the portfolio at a very granular and segmented level to ensure pricing discipline and with a focus on growing the primary bank relationships that bring lower-cost deposits. Turning to Slide 13. We have been dynamically managing the balance sheet against the volatile rate backdrop. This quarter, we continued to execute on our hedging strategy to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer-term, while positioning ourselves to benefit from higher expected rates in the short-term. In Q3, we increased our downside protection by executing a net $6.6 billion of received fixed swaps and $2 billion of callers. We will be proactive in managing our downside risk, while closely monitoring the rate outlook. Our expectation is to continue to deploy downside hedging strategies over the coming months. Additionally, we are actively managing the securities portfolio to both capture the benefit from higher rates over time and protect tangible capital. We maintained the proportion of securities in held to maturity, flat during the quarter and our reinvesting securities portfolio cash flows at rates above portfolio yields. Moving to Slide 14. Non-interest income was $498 million, up $13 million from last quarter. We drove record activity within our capital markets businesses during the quarter, with revenues increasing $19 million, which includes the full quarter impact from Capstone. Capstone's deal pipeline is healthy, and we expect it to contribute to additional growth in the fourth quarter. We remain pleased with the client engagement we are seeing in the wealth management business with positive net asset flows year-to-date. The momentum in net flows has been outweighed by market-based changes in assets under management, resulting in lower overall revenue. Deposit service charges were also lower by $12 million reflecting the expected $9 million impact from Fair Play enhancements that were implemented in July. Our outlook for the impact of these fee adjustments is unchanged from prior guidance. Our Fair Play philosophy is at the center of our strategy and is directly aligned with our mission of looking out for people. We believe the effect of Fair Play continues to be a compelling value proposition for our customers and supports sustainable growth for the bank. Fee revenues were also impacted this quarter by a decline in mortgage banking driven by a lower return on our MSR asset and lower saleable spreads. Moving on to Slide 15. Non-interest expense increased $35 million from the prior quarter. Aligned to our prior guidance, core expenses, excluding notable items, increased $49 million to $1.043 billion. This increase was mainly driven by the full quarter impact from Capstone and Torana. It also included additional compensation expenses related to the strong revenue and production we are seeing in 2022, and impacts from Merit and day count. The underlying expense run rate remains very well controlled. Our efficiency ratio, which is an outcome of our revenue drivers and expense management activities came in at 54.4% on a reported basis and adjusted for notable items was 53.9% for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, this reflects a decrease of 210 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Slide 16 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.3% within our targeted operating range of 9% to 10%. As we go forward, our capital priorities remain unchanged with our first priority to fund organic loan growth. With the robust return on equity, we are generating from our core assets, we are deploying our incremental capital to fund organic growth and drive CET1 toward the middle of our target operating range by year-end. Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, declined to 5.3% as a result of AOCI marks on the securities portfolio. Recall, this temporarily reduces equity as value marks are taken and then accretes back over time. Importantly, this does not impact our regulatory capital ratios. Our TCE ratio, excluding the AOCI impact, increased 19 basis points to 7.2%. Finally, our dividend yield remains well above the median in our peer group at 4.5%. On slide 17, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 15 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 12 basis points and down five basis points from the prior year. Our consumer and commercial portfolios continue to demonstrate stability and credit quality. Nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for five consecutive quarters. Criticized loans have reduced both from the prior quarter and prior year. Allowance for credit losses was up two basis points to 1.89% of total loans, reflecting a conservative reserve posture given the heightened economic uncertainty, even as our internal portfolio metrics show stability. Turning to slide 18. Let me update our latest forecast for Q4. Our guidance assumes the consensus economic outlook through year-end and incorporates the rate curve as of the end of September. Our loan growth guidance remains unchanged at high single-digit growth rate on a year-over-year basis. We are currently tracking toward the higher end of this range. As a result of balance sheet growth and the rate curve outlook, we are again revising guidance higher for net interest income. We now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion to be up in the high 20s to low 30s percentage growth rate for the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. In fee income, we now expect it to be down low single digits for the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. This guidance is reduced from a prior level. We continue to see encouraging trends in core strategic growth areas within fees, namely our capital markets, wealth and advisory and payments businesses and the prior trends we have been seeing in other major fee lines, including mortgage, are within expected levels. The change in our guidance is related to the decision to hold on sheet, the guaranteed portion of our SBA loan production. Market sale premiums for those assets have reduced and it is now more advantageous for us to hold that production on sheet in Q4, as opposed to selling. We will forgo an acceleration of fees this quarter, but benefit from higher spread income out into 2023 and beyond. We believe this is a good economic return, but will cause fee recognition in Q4 to be lower than prior expectations. On expenses, our expectation is for core expenses to be up low single digits in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. We continue to maintain tight control of underlying core expenses, while also seeing some impacts from compensation driven by the strong performance and profitability we are seeing in our 2022 results. Given the higher earnings, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%. Finally, before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. As Steve mentioned earlier, our business is performing exceptionally well right now with solid momentum in the underlying drivers and expanding profitability. We also continue to see strength in our customer trends, where they appear to be managing through the environment well and with solid credit performance. Notwithstanding these clear positives, we are mindful of the heightened uncertainty and risks in the environment. We are closely monitoring the impacts from persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical instability and market volatility. The cone of uncertainty around the near-term economic environment has widened and the probability of a recession is increasing. A bedrock part of the way we manage our business is to be dynamic to ensure we have game plans ready and are positioned; to act to manage through a multitude of scenarios while sustaining top-tier performance; and as always, we are guided by our moderate to low risk appetite through the cycle. We are operating from a position of strength, and we are confident in our ability to successfully manage a range of economic environments. We're looking forward to hosting many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on Thursday, November 10, in New York City and via webcast. We are excited to share more about our strategic growth objectives and our targets to continue to drive top performance and value creation over the years to come. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Zack. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Operator : This time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for all the time this morning. What I wanted to just dig into is how we should be thinking about momentum into 2023 from a loan growth perspective. You've got accelerating growth there, and you've got some NIM benefits that are coming from the mix shift. And I just wanted to understand the dynamic as we should be thinking about loan growth versus peak NIM given in particular the hedges that you're adding? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Sure. Great question. Thank you. This is Zach. I'll take that. I think, in terms of loan growth, we continue to see quite a bit of momentum as we discussed in the prepared remarks, even as we're taking opportunities here in the fourth quarter to optimize where we're driving that incremental production for higher capital returns. And so expect to see continued momentum into the fourth quarter and that will continue into 2023. Notwithstanding the economic uncertainty, we continue to see demand from our clients and pipelines that even as they're pulling through are refilling and so that indicates continued momentum out into 2023 and beyond. And I think as we drive that, we'll also benefit from higher asset yields to the point of your question, and that will support expanding NIM here into the fourth quarter in the near term. Betsy Graseck : And the hedge impact, can you just talk through how we should be thinking about that as we go -- migrate through the next four quarters to eight quarters? Zach Wasserman : Sure. As it relates to hedging, we \u2013 sort of taking a step back, we purposely took a series of actions in 2021 as we discussed to increase the asset sensitivity of the business, and to benefit from higher rates that really or through over the course of the last several quarters, just in Q2 and Q3 of this year, 55 basis points of total core NIM expansion and there's more opportunity ahead. The strategy that we're working through is really based on history, where if you look at the long-term history around rate cycles, typically medium to long-term rates begin to fall right at the peak of the Fed hiking cycle. And so even as we're continuing to benefit from our asset sensitivity over the course of the early part of this year, we have been adding incrementally to the downside hedge protection portfolio, so as to protect against potential downside rate scenarios in 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond. At this point, we've completed around 60% of that total potential capacity for hedging, which based on what we've done so far, would protect around to 35% to 45% of NIM in down ramp scenarios out into those years that I mentioned. From here, I expect to stay asset sensitive, and that will, based on our expectations, drive additional NIM expansion into Q4. Even as we're continuing likely to continue to add to that hedge portfolio here over the next over the coming months, staying dynamic, walk through of interest rates, but continuing to protect against that downside. So the net of those things should support continued loan growth, as I said, and help to protect and maintain really strong levels of NIM as we go forward. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Zach, appreciate the comments on NII into the fourth quarter. So the guidance indeed looks like another step-up that the growth rate will moderate as one might expect. Once we are, sort of, done with the Fed's tightening cycle? And maybe, if you can just comment, or give your thoughts around the ability to sustain positive NII momentum after that's all finished. It sounds like certainly the volume side sounds pretty optimistic, but we would just be curious to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes? Zach Wasserman : Yeah. Yeah, it's a great question. And I think that, the model will be that sustained growth rate in loans, coupled with the rising in the near-term and then stable NIM out into the future to really drive sustained continued growth in NII on a dollar basis. The trajectory around NIM in 2023 is very much a function of what happens with the economy, clearly and where the rate curve is trending. So it's \u2013 I won't give you a clear guidance at this point. We'll talk more about that as we engage in future sessions, but our expectation is that 2023 will look quite good from a NIM perspective and that the volume growth will really support sustained continued growth in NII. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then if I could switch gears to the expense side for a moment. The cost base maybe a little higher than I would have expected into the fourth quarter, are the compensation pressures, will those sort of \u2013 I mean, are those related to just the strong earnings performance for this year? Will those \u2013 that base that we've got in the fourth quarter continue into next year as well. In other words, there's some of the transitory versus ongoing? Zach Wasserman : Yes. It's a good question. Really, that -- the portion of expenses in the third quarter that we're calling out is compensation related or really are, in fact, related to the exceptionally strong levels of production and revenue and ultimately profitability we're seeing in 2022. And our baseline posture for expense management at this point is to be keeping the core underlying growth of expenses very well controlled and at a low level. The model, as we've talked about, quite a bit over time is for us to self-fund investments in our strategic initiatives, execution on the TCF revenue synergies and our continued technology development program by driving efficiencies in the core operating expense base of the company through scale, process, automation, et cetera. An indication of that is we're continuing to optimize our branch network. We just announced a week or so ago, another 31 branch closures that will be implemented in the early part of next year, and that's just sort of how we'll drive that efficiency to continue to keep expenses growing at a low level and of course, drive positive operating leverage as we go forward. So that's the run rate that we see as we get out into 2023. And of course, we'll provide more clear guidance as we get closer to the beginning of next year. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning everyone. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Steven. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. Steven Alexopoulos : I want to start on the deposit side. So in the quarter, you grew average loans by $3 billion, but deposits by $1 billion, and we saw a mix shift out of non-interest-bearing into brokered that -- what do you see as a risk of non-interest-bearing outflows, right? Talk about the funding strategy? And where do you see the mix evolving to? Zach Wasserman : Yes. It's a really good question, and it's obviously a key area of considerable focus. We really like the results we're seeing on the deposit side in Q3 and solid execution of our strategy of driving toward primary bank relationships and operating accounts, even as we're staying very dynamic and really managing interest expense and the trajectory on that exceptionally closely. What I expect into the fourth quarter is more of the same. So I expect to see deposits grow into the fourth quarter commercial led -- and even as, of course, beta and interest expense costs are beginning now to tick up as we go into the fourth quarter, just kind of taking a step back in terms of the overall funding mix to the point of your question. As we see it, we're starting this cycle and beginning into the early stages of it from a really solid position relative to cycles. The loan-to-deposit ratio is relatively low. Non-customer sources of funding are also relatively low. And that leaves us in a good position to leverage diversified funding sources to fund that we've got. Of course, deposits are the core and that's why we're pleased that they're growing. But we do have the opportunity to leverage short-term and long-term other sources of funding, which we'll do in a diversified way to balance the funding sources, and to be frank, to put good tension in the system to really support our disciplined approach to pricing and deposit growth over time. And so that's the model that we'll use. And I think as we go out into the future, we'll see that balance of funding. Steven Alexopoulos : That's helpful. And then to follow up. So based on the ranges that you're giving for the updated fourth quarter guidance, we can get to a scenario where NIM is flat or even down a little bit in the quarter -- fourth quarter. Could you frame for us how much NIM expansion you're thinking about for 4Q? And was your answer to Scott's question that you think NIM could hold flattish next year? Is that the base case? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. So, I do expect to see NIM expansion into the fourth quarter. It won't be at the same rate that we've seen for the last couple of quarters, but I do think, we'll see that continue to expand into the fourth quarter. As we go into 2023, what happens kind of over the longer term out into the back half of '23 is really going to be a function of where we see the yield curve going and the economy as I mentioned. And so, you could see stability, you could see some downdraft. We'll see. I think it's going to be a function of those drivers. With that being said, our focus, as I said before, is really on growing net interest income on a dollar basis. And I think the loan growth we're bringing through will help to sustain and support that over time. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Thanks. Steve, that deserves some type of award for the way he has managed this balance sheet so far in this environment. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. It's a team effort, but appreciate the recognition. Zach Wasserman : It's also early innings. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks, good morning. Zach, if I could follow up on the securities book. I was wondering, if you could just help us understand how the paid fixed, receive variable swaps have helped the securities book, noting that your yields were up 50 basis points in that book this quarter on top of a prior 50 basis points. It seems like you're really getting that extra juice off the securities book. So, can you kind of just help us understand like what's -- how long does that help you for on that swap side? And then, what are you expecting just the overall size of the book to look like going forward? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Great question. In terms of size, we think the securities portfolio is rightsized with respect to the size of the balance sheet at this point. It's about 24% of total assets, 26% of earning assets. And I expected to say, proportionately the same -- at the same level for the foreseeable future. It's -- we're essentially managing it for our liquidity as a corporation at this point. In terms of yields, we did see a 50 basis point increase in portfolio yield into the third quarter, which was obviously very helpful for NIM. If I was to reconcile that for you, about 30 basis points of that 50 was from the hedge portfolio. Just under 10 basis points was from the impact of new money yields coming in during the quarter and the remainder of roughly 11 basis points was driven by a reduction in premium amortization. I expect that we'll continue to see rising yields out of the securities portfolio, partly as a function of that just continued reduction in premium amort, the hedge portfolio should continue to benefit us as well as the rate curve has ticked up just a bit incrementally from the end of the third quarter here and new money yields are pretty attractive relative to existing portfolio yield. To give you a sense, team is currently investing somewhere between 5.15% and 5.35% yields here as we enter October. So that will continue to be accretive to yield as we go forward. Ken Usdin : Okay. And just to follow up, I'll ask on that, just then, Zach, that 30 basis points help like. How long is that helper in that part of the portfolio, the swaps on the securities book? How long does that carry forward for? Zach Wasserman : It will continue to carry forward for a while here. The tenure of those are multiple years. And so we'll obviously have to see where the trajectory of the yield curve goes to the extent to they drive incremental benefit on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but they will protect us for some time to come to the extent that rates keep rising. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. Thank you, Zach. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Steve or Rich, can you talk a little bit about how you're balancing growth with -- I think, Steve, your comment was potential economic uncertainty. Your numbers look clean, but you did have a higher provision and you took your reserves up a little bit. So talk a little bit about credit, and Rich, maybe give us some help on what you're thinking on provision and reserves. Zach Wasserman : Let me start, and I'll turn it over to Rich, John. Thanks for the question. First of all, credit was really good again this quarter, and we feel very, very good about our position. We talked about it internally being a strong position that we're playing from and you'll hear us occasionally reference it externally as well. Balanced book, balanced portfolio, lot of discipline about aggregate moderate to low-risk appetite over many years, you've seen our credit metrics quarter-over-quarter on the consumer side, super prime. It's -- we're feeling -- obviously, we're feeling very good about it. Obviously, we're working it diligently. There's a lot of portfolio review that's very active portfolio management underway constantly, and the teams are doing a great job. So now that I've stole most of Rich's thunder, let me turn it over to Rich. Rich Pohle : I was going to say there's not a whole lot to add there. But as Steve mentioned, I mean, the credit looks really good. We've got eight basis points of charge-offs for the year in crit-class and NPAs are both trending down for several quarters. With respect to the increase in the reserve coverage, I mean, the allowance went up by $64 million in the quarter, and most of that was coming from loan growth. So we've taken this consistently a prudent approach since -- to our ACL since COVID came in 2020. And we think that we've got a good position of strength right now heading into a possible downturn. You know, as it relates to how we're managing the growth versus where we are in the cycle, I mean, we are fundamentally laser-focused on client selection, and we underwrite our clients at all times to how do they perform through the cycle. And clearly, with one coming up potentially, we're paying heightened attention to that. But we're always sensitizing for higher rates for stress with inflation and other variables as we underwrite our credits, and that's not changing. So we feel that we can grow the balance sheet and grow it prudently, and we'll move forward from there. So we feel good about where we are. Jon Arfstrom : Just as a follow-up on client selection of your comment. Can you talk a little bit about the consumer as well? I mean, your numbers are incredibly clean, but are you expecting some deterioration there over time or just give us your overall thoughts there, Rich? Rich Pohle : Yes. We are expecting it. And really, when you talk about deterioration, I mean, you are coming off a very low base, right? With all the stimulus money that came into the system in 2020 and into 2021. The levels of delinquencies and the level of charge-offs are really unsustainable. So what we're looking at is more of a return to normal. We're closely watching the early-stage delinquencies and they're exactly where we thought they would be. I mean, they are up off of those historic lows. But if you go back and you look at where delinquencies would have been in 2018 and 2019, we're not at those more normal levels. And with respect to charge-offs, we've had net recoveries in many of our consumer portfolios in the first, second and even into the third quarter. And we do expect over time that those are going to return to the norm. But right now, we feel very good about where the consumer book is positioned. John Arfstrom : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I guess, following up on the last question first. Specifically, on indirect auto, I mean, we're seeing some pockets of, I guess, stress last normalization elsewhere. I think your mix is a lot different and just so much higher quality, you've been so consistent. Obviously, you had just like $3 million of losses. But specifically, Derek, can you talk about what you're seeing and if there's any changes that you're making either on the origination side, or I guess, we're hearing about collections being tricky as well? Thanks. Rich Pohle : Hey, Matt, it's Rich. I'll take that. So as we've been in this business for 75 years, and we've been through all sorts of cycles and as you know, our model is one of focusing on prime and super prime customers. And one of the benefits that we've developed over time is the ability to put in highly predictive custom scorecards with response to fall expectations. So we're underwriting to not getting the car back in the first place. And we are mindful of the fact that used car prices are coming down, and we build that into our decisioning. If you look on slide 37 of the earnings deck, you'll see that, while we're maintaining really strong FICOs and custom scorecard ratings, our LTVs have come down steadily since the third quarter of 2020. And so we've got a very disciplined and sophisticated underwriting approach, and the fact that we're, I think, prudently bringing the LTVs down over time speaks well to how that folk is going to perform. It's a core competency of the bank. We are \u2013 expect the charge-offs to return to normal. But for right now, we're enjoying what we think is a really strong core competency that we bring to that business. Steve Steinour : Even the normal \u2013 that is on a comparative basis to the industry is just excellent. So we underwrite for roughly 20, 25 bps of loss and obviously, we're not seeing that now. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, you care to give us maybe a 30-second kind of preview of the Investor Day in terms of what you're looking to accomplish. You talked about strategic update and financial targets, but anything you want to give a full review of? Thanks Zach Wasserman : Sure. This is Zach. I'll take that one. Thanks for serving up that question. We are really excited about the opportunity to engage on November 10, Thursday in New York City and via webcast for Investor Day. We've got quite a robust agenda planned. We'll go through each of our major business lines, each of our key functions like credit and risk management, and human resources, and we'll share kind of an overview, not only of the strategy generally, but also what our updated long-term expectations are for financial performance and kind of the road map for us to get there. So it's going to be a robust discussion. And I think will serve as a great launching off point for a series of additional conversations thereafter. So really excited about it and look forward to three weeks from now. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thanks. See you there. Steve Steinour : See you. Operator : Thank you. We do have a question coming from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Erika. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : My first question was for Steve. And Steve, I was laughing at your response to Steven Alexopoulos' comment is classic. Your efficiency ratio medium-term target is 56% and obviously, with the help of your -- the business strengths and rates went down to 54% in the quarter. And I'm wondering if the medium-term range still holds in that you'll look to continue to reinvest back in the business, especially as rates are helping the denominator side of that equation. Steve Steinour : Erika, if we could defer that question to Investor Day, I would be very pleased, but I also very much appreciate the inquiry. Erika Najarian : Got it. I tried. Steve Steinour : I can see that. You certainly did. Erika Najarian : Second question is a follow-up for Zach. I'm going to ask Steve's question another way. I think it was -- I saw it as an accomplishment that your period end deposits grew and you kept your cost of deposits to 25 bps, well below where I think everybody was expecting to go -- so as we think about your outlook for good loan growth and some NII growth next year, how should we think about deposit growth from here? I fully understand your message that you never got to search deposits in the first place. But how should we think about core deposit growth outside of mix shift. And additionally, how you're thinking about the terminal deposit beta from here? Zach Wasserman : Sure. It's a great question, Erika, and let me see if I can expand on some of that. So in terms of deposits, our expectation is to grow core deposits into the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier, commercial led commercial just continues to perform very well. I think we're really benefiting from all of the investments that we've made to expand the strength of the team and expertise and capabilities, not to mention the boost around TCF synergies, which are really contributing. And so that will be the core driver into Q4. What's interesting on the consumer side, I do expect to see some continued downdraft in consumer core into the fourth quarter, but actually pretty encouraging underlying trends. What's happening in consumer is a bit of a tale of two cities where the underlying trend in customer acquisition, household acquisition and primary bank relationship growth and the deepening efforts that we've got both in our offline channels and increasingly now on the digital channels are really working. And we're seeing nice expanding deposit gathering from those activities. What's offsetting that is what we -- the well documented phenomenon of the elevated level of savings and so-called surge deposits from the COVID area -- era are running down. And the net of those two things has been a modest reduction over the last several quarters. I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter before that -- the surge balance, a downdraft sort of start to wane and the underlying growth that we're seeing in that core activity within consumer start to come to the fore. And so, we're encouraged about the longer-term trends in consumer. And as I look out over the 2023 period, I expect to see deposit growth. We'll continue to see commercial probably growing faster, but consumer contributing with net positive growth. As it relates to beta, we'll see. I think, we're pretty sanguine on this point that we've seen low deposit beta thus far, and I think that's been shared very much across the industry and a number of the peers have seen that through the third quarter. The market is becoming more active, as I said earlier, in the back half of Q3 and continuing now into Q4. So I expect to see beta rising in the fourth quarter. It's kind of as we expected, so not overly different than what we've been planning for all along, but that is trending. Where it ultimately goes, in my opinion, is a bit theoretical. Everything continues to track generally to our plan thus far. But where we're focused is on our strategy, drive the primary bank and operating account relationships, stay very rigorous in terms of the detailed management and very dynamic in watching the market and ultimately ensure that we can keep supporting our customers and growing those relationships, which so far has been working, and that's what we'll keep doing. Erika Najarian : Thanks. See you in three weeks. Zach Wasserman : Looking forward to it, Erika. Steve Steinour : Thanks. End of Q&A: Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor over to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Well, thank you for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter for all of us at Huntington. We're very pleased to see our second straight quarter of record net income and third straight quarter of record PPNR. We believe we're well positioned to manage through the current uncertain economic outlook. We remain committed to and we're confident of our ability to continue to create value for our shareholders. And just as a reminder, the Board executives and our colleagues, we're a top 10 shareholder collectively, reflecting our strong alignment with shareholders. So thank you for your support and interest today, and we hope we'll see many of you in three weeks. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We are very pleased to announce our fourth quarter results, which included GAAP net income of $645 million and adjusted net income of $657 million. For the full-year, reported GAAP net income was $2.2 billion, and adjusted net income was $2.3 billion. Both results reflect record earnings for Huntington. 2022 marked a year of numerous successes driven by our team's execution of organic growth initiatives, realization of both expense and revenue synergies from the TCF acquisition. An unwavering focus on credit discipline and proactive balance sheet management. We ended the year with substantial momentum. Clearly, the economic environment is becoming increasingly challenging. However, Huntington is better positioned today than at any time since I joined over a dozen years ago. And over those years, we've transformed the risk profile of the bank and remained highly disciplined. We are taking proactive steps now to again position Huntington to outperform, and we entered the year with solid capital levels, top-tier reserves, a growing core deposit base and strong credit metrics. We continue to see opportunities to grow revenue and profit.  Now on to slide four. First, we finished the year with our fourth consecutive quarter of record pre-provision net revenue. This was supported by higher interest income driven by earning asset growth and an expanded net interest margin. Revenue growth has been exceptional over the course of the year, and we intend to protect and grow that revenue base. Second, we delivered broad-based loan growth ex PPP up 10% year-over-year. As we drove this growth, we also optimized for return while still exceeding our loan growth outlook. One example of this optimization is indirect auto, where our production in the quarter was approximately 15% lower than the prior quarter, while our new loan yields increased by over 100 basis points. Importantly, we continue to grow our deposit base with multiple consecutive quarters of growth. We believe this is a differentiator for Huntington in this environment. It also demonstrates the breadth of our franchise and our colleagues' ability to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships. Third, our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year reflect a top-tier return profile and were at or above our medium-term targets. These results demonstrate the earnings power of the company, and we expect to continue to deliver on these targets. As we intended, we delivered common equity Tier 1 capital to the middle of our 9% to 10% operating range. We are also very pleased to announce a new two-year share repurchase program. Fourth, we ended \u201822 with strong momentum across the business that we carry into this new year. We remain focused on growth, aligned with our risk appetite. Importantly, we have the capital, credit reserves and strength of balance sheet that give us confidence to continue to deliver on our organic growth priorities. Slide five highlights the tremendous earnings power of the franchise, which has improved sequentially over the course of the year. PPNR is over 60% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Our return on tangible common equity is top tier. We managed our asset sensitivity throughout the year and deliberately positioned the company to benefit from higher interest rates, which resulted in significant revenue growth. We've also been prudent in taking actions to protect this revenue base should we experience lower rates over the next few years. We will continue to be dynamic in this regard with our goal of reducing volatility and creating a tight quarter around the path of spread revenue. At our Investor Day in November, we shared with you our highly defined set of strategic priorities. We expect these strategies will drive sustained revenue growth and support gains in efficiency over the long-term. As you also heard, this management team is a group of experienced operators. To further accelerate the execution of these strategies and support increased efficiency, we will be taking a series of actions during \u201823 to align our organizational structure with a focus on our critical priorities. We expect these actions will result in new growth and efficiency opportunities. We will share more details on these actions as they're finalized over the course of the first quarter However, one element will be a voluntary retirement program for our middle and senior management. Overall, I believe this program will be important to support our colleagues and create value for our shareholders. In closing, we are well positioned for continued growth. We have the strategies and the momentum in our businesses to support growth. We also benefit from highly engaged colleagues who have consistently delivered outstanding customer service and are a true differentiator. We have a credit discipline to outperform and remain focused on rigorous expense management, investment prioritization and capital allocation. We remain committed to our long track record of managing to positive annual operating leverage and are intently focused on driving shareholder value.  Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.42 and adjusted EPS was $0.43. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 26% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 26.5%. Further adjusting for AOCI ROTCE was 19.8%. Loan balances continued to expand as total loans increased by $1.9 billion and excluding PPP, increased by $2.1 billion. Deposit balances increased by $1.6 billion on an end-of-period basis, while average deposits were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Pre-provision net revenue expanded sequentially by 4.2% from last quarter to $893 million. And on a full-year basis, year-over-year increased by 36% to $3.2 billion. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 17 basis points and nonperforming assets declining to 50 basis points. Turning to slide seven. Average loan balances increased 1.7% quarter-over-quarter driven by both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans continue to represent the majority of loan growth within commercial, excluding PPP, average loans increased by $1.9 billion or 2.7% from the prior quarter. Primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance, which increased $900 million tied to continued normalization of dealer inventory levels, as well as seasonality with shipments of winter equipment arriving to dealers. We also saw the continued long-term trend of demand within our asset finance businesses, which drove balances $300 million higher in the quarter. Commercial real estate balances increased by $500 million largely as a result of production late in the third quarter and lower prepays. End-of-period balances were higher by $180 million. Auto floor plan utilization continued to normalize, which drove balances higher by $300 million. Additional increases in line utilization over time, represents a substantial ongoing opportunity. We also saw higher balances in specialty verticals. Such as mid-corporate and tech and telecom, which were offset by lower balances in other areas as a result of our return optimization initiatives. In Consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage which increased by $500 million as on sheet production outpaced runoff and was supported by slower prepaid speeds. Partially offsetting this growth were lower auto balances, which declined by $230 million and RV Marine, which declined by $50 million. Turning to slide eight. We delivered $1.6 billion of deposit growth for the quarter and $4.6 billion for the year on an ending basis, on an average basis, deposits were lower by two-tenth of 1% while increasing 2.4% year-over-year. Competition for deposits has intensified, beginning in earnest in September and continuing into the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, we are pleased with the traction we saw over the course of the quarter as our teams delivered robust production, demonstrating the deposit gathering capabilities across the bank. Ending deposit growth was led by consumer, which increased by $1.6 billion. We saw a mix shift in line with our expectations, including incremental growth in both money market and time deposits. We continue to remain disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at 64 basis points for the fourth quarter. We will remain dynamic balancing core deposit growth, the competitive rate environment and the utilization of a broadrange of funding options. On slide nine, we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and NIM. Core net interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, increased by $67 million or 5% and to $1.459 billion. Net interest margin expanded 10 basis points on a GAAP basis from the prior quarter and expanded 11 basis points on a core basis, excluding accretion. Slide 10 highlights our high-quality deposit base and diversified funding profile. For the current cycle to date, our beta on total cost of deposits was 17%, as we have noted, we expect deposit rates to continue to trend higher from here over the course of the rate cycle. Overall, our beta continues to track to our expectations. Turning to slide 11. Throughout 2022, we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset sensitivity. We also incrementally added to our hedging program to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term. During the quarter, we executed a net $3.2 billion of received fixed swaps and $800 million of forward-starting swaption collars. At this point, based on the current rate outlook and yield curve opportunities, we believe we have optimized the size of the program. We are comfortable with our position today as we balance near-term costs versus longer-term protection. As always, we will be dynamic as we monitor the outlook and the yield curve. We maintain unused hedge capacity that we could deploy should the curve revert and/or steepen to a level where we would add incremental downside rate protection hedges. On the securities portfolio, we saw another step-up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We are benefiting from reinvestment as well as the hedge strategy to protect capital. We will continue to reinvest cash flows of approximately $1 billion each quarter, at attractive new purchase yields around 5%. Moving to slide 12. Non-interest income was $499 million, up $1 million from last quarter. We drove record activity within our capital markets businesses during the quarter and throughout 2022. Capstone continued to perform well and our underlying capital markets businesses outside of Capstone finished the year strong, up 26% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the client engagement we are seeing in the wealth management business with another positive quarter of net asset flows. On a year-over-year basis, we saw lower mortgage banking income as a result of the higher rate environment and from lower deposit service charges from fair play enhancements we implemented during 2022. Offsetting these factors were higher capital markets revenues and payments revenues. Importantly, we're executing on our strategy to drive higher value revenue streams and our fee mix continues to trend favourably. Moving on to slide 13. GAAP noninterest expense increased $24 million compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted for notable items, core expenses increased by $19 million. This quarterly increase in core expenses was primarily the result of revenue-driven compensation tied to capital markets production. Additionally, we saw seasonally higher medical claims in the quarter, which increased by $16 million. Underlying these results, core expenses were well controlled, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined expense management. Slide 14 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 increased to 9.44%. Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, increased to 5.55%. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.3%. We ended the year having delivered on our plan to drive common equity Tier 1 to the middle of our 9% to 10% operating range. Going forward, our capital priorities have not changed, fund organic growth, support our dividend and provide capacity for all other uses, including share repurchases. After having held back on share repurchases for the last several quarters, our expectation is that over the course of 2023 and beyond, we will now return to a more normalized capital distribution mix, including share repurchases. Our Board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2024. Given the current economic outlook, our thinking is that we will not actively repurchase shares during the first-half of 2023. And as we watch the path of the economy. This may result in capital ratios continuing to expand in the near-term. We like the flexibility the program provides, and we believe it is prudent to maintain an authorized share repurchase program as part of our overall capital management framework. On slide 15, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 17 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 2 basis points and up 5 basis points from the prior year as credit performance continues to normalize. Nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for six consecutive quarters. Criticized loans have similarly improved for four consecutive quarters. Allowance for credit losses was up slightly, driving the coverage ratio higher to 1.9% of total loans. Turning to slide 16. You will note a strong reserve position. As I mentioned, the portfolio has continued to perform extraordinarily well, and we believe our disciplined approach to credit through the cycle underpins the overall strength of our balance sheet. We were pleased to update our medium-term financial targets at Investor Day in November, and these form the foundation of our expectations over our strategic planning horizon. We believe these metrics are at the core of value creation. Profit growth, return on capital and the commitment to drive positive annual operating leverage. Turning to slide 18. Let me share some thoughts on our 2023 outlook. As we discussed at Investor Day, we analyze multiple potential economic scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans. Our targets are anchored on a baseline scenario that is informed by the consensus economic outlook and the forward yield curve as of December 31. The baseline assumes a mild recession in 2023 with modest net GDP growth for the full-year. The economy is expected to exit the year on the path toward recovery with inflation gradually subsiding. Since Investor Day, the economic outlook is incrementally worse and is likely at the lower end of the baseline scenario outcomes. Our baseline outlook for 2023 is for average loans to grow between 5% and 7%, led by commercial with more modest growth in consumer. We will continue to focus on optimizing for returns and driving loan expansion in select areas. Deposits are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, reflecting continued growth and deepening of customer and primary bank relationships. Net interest income is expected to increase between 8% and 11%, driven by continued earning asset growth and expanded full-year net interest margin. Non-interest income is projected to be approximately flat. We expect continued robust performance from our areas of strategic focus : capital markets, payments and wealth management. During 2023, several other factors are offsetting that growth including our anticipated holding of the majority of our SBA loan production on sheet, thereby reducing near-term fee revenue in favour of longer-term high-return spread revenue. Lower income of approximately $23 million associated with purchase accounting accretion in fees. Please refer to slide 30 for more details. Lower operating lease revenue as we continue to transition to more capital leases. Importantly, we expect this will result in lower operating lease depreciation expense as well. Lower mortgage banking income for the full-year 2023 versus 2022. And finally, in light of the economic outlook, we are implementing risk mitigating deposit policy changes that will result in a lower incidence of overdrafts and related service charges. In addition, we are reducing NSF fees to 0 in the first quarter. This will result in an approximate $5 million reduction in fee income per quarter, which we expect to be more than offset by lower associated charge-offs. As you know, the first quarter is generally a seasonal low for overall fee income. We expect fee income will grow sequentially throughout the remainder of the year. On expenses, as Steve noted, we intend to hold growth to a low level given the environment, even as we remain committed to funding critical long-term investments. We plan to manage core underlying expense growth between 2% and 4% for the full-year. This level of expense growth benefits from the ongoing efficiency initiatives we've discussed previously, such as Operation accelerate, branch optimization and the organizational alignment actions that Steve highlighted. Added to the core expense growth, we expect approximately $60 million higher expenses from the full-year run rate of Capstone in Toronto, and $33 million of increased FDIC insurance expense associated with the surcharge. In addition, we expect the first half of the year to include some amount of restructuring charges associated with the expense management actions we are taking. We will provide more details about these actions later in the quarter. Overall, our low expense growth coupled with expanded revenues, is expected to support another year of positive operating leverage. We expect net charge-offs will be on the low end of our long-term through-the-cycle range of 25 to 45 basis points. Our 2023 guidance reflects the current macroeconomic outlook. We will continue to be diligent in analyzing the macro environment and will react as needed to manage as the year plays out. We ended 2022 in a position of strength and have good momentum. We have every expectation of continuing to outperform this year. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions and answers. Tim, over to you. A - Tim Sedabres : Thank you, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. Hey, question on deposit growth. You mentioned deposit competition has intensified quite a bit. And we can see from the CD rates that you're offering in the market that you've been proactively raising the CD rates and offering more 14-month CDs. So just given all of that, can you talk about how much of the projected deposit growth in 2023 will be driven by CDs? And what the overall deposit mix is likely to look like? Zach Wasserman : Sure. Yes. This is Zach. I'll take that question. Thank you for asking it. Generally speaking, we're seeing our deposit growth continue to trend pretty well in line with the outlook that we've given between 1% and 4% growth for the full-year. So, we think we're on that run rate. I think it will be balanced between both consumer and partial and to your point, we'll continue to the mix of that deposit gathering will continue to trend as we expected and it is baked into our overall rate and beta expectations for higher rate products like time deposits like money market et cetera. I think we're beginning -- we're operating in this rate cycle clearly at a lower level of mix of those products than we were, for example, the last rate cycle. So, we'll see that trend higher throughout the course of the next several quarters, but in line with our general expectations, it all comes back to our focus on deepening relationships with our existing customers and our primary bank relationships. And so, we think it's working pretty well and expected to continue as we go to\u2026 Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then maybe on the NIM trajectory from here, can you comment on if we're close to peak. And given what you said on the hedges and the fact that the program, at least for now. I mean how should we think about a floor for NIM from here over the course of the next four to eight quarters, as I said, does start cutting rates. Zach Wasserman : Yes. On the topic of NIM, I think just take a step back, we've significantly benefited over the last two quarters from explicit actions to manage asset sensitivity seen more than 60 basis points NIM expansion in the last three quarters alone. And that was very intentional with in mind towards continuing our top-tier performance in NIM over the course of long periods of time that we've done. As we stand now, as we start to look into, we do believe there's more room to go on asset bases, and we'll see yields continuing to increase out over the next few quarters. However, we're further along in that process probably three quarters of the way through than we are on the deposit beta side, but we also expect, as we said, rates continue to track higher over the course of the next several quarters, we're probably only about halfway through the deposit beta cycle. And when you couple that dynamic with what is currently expectation, the yield curve that we'll see short-end rates fall towards the latter part of 2024. It is reasonable to project a somewhat downward trajectory of NIM over the course of 2023. Our goal will be to manage NIM, as we've said on a number of occasions previously within a tighter corridor in 2023 as we can, really protecting the downside hedging program and ultimately driving towards sequential and sustained growth in net interest income on a dollar basis. And I think when we couple what we expect to be a pretty strong NIM level overall with the loan growth that we expect to continue to drive, again, to the guidance 5% to 7% over the course of this year, we'll see that NII on dollar rate is continuing to expand, and it's about focus. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning, everyone. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : I want to start sort of follow-up, Zach. With the NIM expected to trend down given all the hedges and protection you've put in place to sort of tighten that ban. And can you frame for us how much downside could we see what's the range? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Thanks, even, for the question. Look, I think the trend is something on the order of single-digit reduction on kind of a quarterly basis as we go throughout 2023. There's a range of uncertainty. So, I want to be clear, not being overly precise, you just think about all the factors that are going to play into that. The Fed funds actions, which, as you know, from staring at the dot plots are not aligned with the market expectation. So how that all plays out, I think it's going to be the most important factor the pace and trajectory of beta, which at this point seems to be fairly well linear across time, but we'll have to wait and see how that goes. And clearly, the big one is the economy where that tracks over the near term. So, it's difficult to be overly precise, so I'm trying not to and bring back to dollar. Our goal will be to drive NII on a dollar basis. I said, I do expect some downward trajectory in them and probably something on the order of single digits on a sequential basis each quarter. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. That's helpful. And then Zack, when we look at, you're obviously expecting more loan growth than deposit growth, a fairly large issuance of sub debt this quarter. Could you walk us through the funding strategy? I know you said you expect the overall growth in average earning assets. But what's the funding strategy? It seems like you have to do much more than just on the deposit side? And maybe what will be the cost of that? Zach Wasserman : Yes. I think it's an important point. And it's something that we feel is a point of strength and an advantage at this point in the cycle, given that we're coming to the early to middle stage of the cycle has still a very advantageous overall position in terms of loan-to-deposit ratio, the mix of important categories of spot like time deposits in our noncustomer funding kind of relative to history. And so, it allows us, as I've mentioned on a number of previous occasions to utilize the balance source of funding. If you look back at what happened in 2022, we grew loans at 10% deposits were more in the 2.5% range. Clearly, loan deposit ratios have tracked up, and we used a broad range of other funding sources like long-term debt like the FHLB and other noncustomer sources to balance out. The same is going to be true for 2023, albeit to a somewhat less degree thinking about loan growth in that mid- to high single-digits range, 5% to 7%. Deposit growth in the 1% to 4% does imply we'll continue to see loan-to-deposit ratios tick up. And you'll see us, therefore, continue to utilize other balance funding sources like the Federal Home Loan Bank, other noncustomer sources of funding there. The rates that we're seeing are pretty reasonable. The incremental economics certainly on that loan growth continued very accretive to return on capital and the overall cost of deposits and funding within that beta expectation so NIM expectation. Could I just talk on that question. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Zach Wasserman : Thank you, Steven. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning. Hey, Zach, I wanted to ask you; I know we talked about this last quarter. The security swaps that you had added a nice amount of net interest income again. And I'm just wondering, can you help us understand just the benefit from that, if ineffectiveness helped that again? And just how does that go -- like how do we track that going forward relative to just interest rates in terms of the benefits that you should get from there? Zach Wasserman : Yes. They were a very powerful benefit. I think it's -- they're protected, as you know, about one-third a whole would have otherwise been AOCI Mark reduction, which was their primary attention originally, but also have played out in terms of really strong reported yields in the securities portfolio. Roughly half of the approximately 50 bps increase in securities yield was from that hedging program to give you a sense of the scale of it. And I think where it goes from here in terms of incremental benefit is going to be, to some degree, a function of just where that mid-portion of the curve goes and at this point, it's fairly well topped out. I'm not expecting a ton more lift there. The lift from that has reduced somewhat from the third quarter, but it still is very accretive we're not adding to that portfolio now. And so, I think we're getting the benefit that we expected from it. Ken Usdin : Okay. Great. And then one follow-up on deposit beta. 17% total cumulative so far through the cycle. Can you just remind us what you're thinking about betas from here and just to be super clear for us, if you don't mind, on I think you guys usually do talk on total? Zach Wasserman : Yes, sure. So, it was 17%, to give sense is kind of tracking across time, it was 6% in Q2, 11% Q3, 17% in Q4. So, continues to track and kind of in the additional 5 to 6% to 7% range each quarter. And the expectation is to go out into Q1, it can be sort of more of the same, continuing out over until we get into the middle part of the year. Our planning assumption Ken, is something on the order of 35% total through the cycle, which would indicate we're about halfway through to the prior point that I made. With nothing that I'll tell you where we're intently focused is on the day-to-day management and really very, very rigorous looking client by client in the commercial portfolio, geography by geography in the in the consumer portfolio and ensuring that we can stay competitive and ensure we've got a strong deposit franchise. And so, we'll continue to wait and see and manage against that. If the outlook changes will let you know. But at this point, it continues to track according to that broad expectation. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. Thank you, Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. You mentioned on slide 18 that you expect to be at the low end of your net charge-off range. The tone very quickly changed this week from some land into hard landing. I guess my question here is this may be obvious to us that have covered the company for a while, but what makes you confident despite the deteriorating economic outlook that you could stay at the low end of that already pretty low range and given some of -- there was a -- I wouldn't call them up here, but there was a company that reported pretty eye-popping delinquency numbers in auto this morning. I'm wondering if you could give us what's going on with auto credit trends underneath. And again, we remind us why you feel confident about how that portfolio would perform in an economic downturn. Rich Pohle : Erika, it's Rich. Let me take that. I'll go -- I'll answer your second question first with respect to auto. So, we are seeing delinquencies in our portfolio. And again, remember, this is a prime and super prime portfolio. And as we talked about at Investor Day, we've been in this business for decades, and we've got very sophisticated custom scorecards that we use in our client selection process. So, we feel very good about where this business is today and spend through numerous cycles and it's proven itself that it can outperform peers from a loss content through various cycles. So, we feel good about that. The delinquencies right now are right where we would expect them to be from a seasonal standpoint. If you go back and you look at where would have been in that 2018 and 2019 area. We're still trending below those pre-COVID levels. So, we feel good there. And we've been very proactive as it relates to how we're managing our loan to values in that space as well. So I don't have any real concerns about our indirect auto space. I feel very comfortable with how that business is growing. With respect to the overall comfort that we have in our net charge-off forecast. I think it goes back to our customer makeup. As I talked about at Investor Day, on the consumer side, we are overwhelmingly a secured creditor. 95% of our loans are secured. And again, we've got that prime focus and high FICOs of origination around 770. So, it is a very strong book and throughout all of that back I just talked about auto, but even RV Marine resi, all of those portfolios are showing very well from a delinquency standpoint. So, we feel good there. On the commercial side, we have taken a lot of steps to reposition this book over the last several years going through into more specialty businesses, more larger companies, public companies so we feel that we've mitigated the loss content in that portfolio as well. So even though, as Zach pointed out, we're looking at more of a mild recession than a severe landing that's why we feel comfortable with where we are from a charge-off forecast at that low end. Now clearly, if the economy worsens, where we land within that range is going to depend on where the economy goes and how the Fed reacts. But at this point, we're comfortable with where we put that guidance. Steve Steinour : But Erika, this is Steve. A number of the guidance is through the cycle, and we've been well below the through-the-cycle average. And at this point, we're guiding to the lowest end of the range. And we've been strategic on how we position the lending activities now for a dozen years. We've been very disciplined Richard team, along with the lending teams that have adhere to the discipline, didn't open up in some of the areas of my benefit to frothy and recent vintages. So, we've got a really good core book on both the commercial side. And as a super prime and secured lender generally on the consumer side, we actually think of that as a lower risk book. So, our aggregate out low risk profile and discipline over many years will serve us well, certainly in auto and frankly, the entire portfolio. Erika Najarian : And my second question is on that 6% to 9% PPNR growth, medium-term target. Clearly, you expect to hit that this year. And I'm wondering, obviously, it gets more difficult if the Fed is cutting which a lot of investors expect for 2024. And maybe the question is I know we'll hear more from you on this expense management actions that you're taking for which you will incur a restructuring charge. But is that an example of the commitment that Huntington has to deliver this PPNR growth range with consistency over the medium term on an annual basis, even if the revenue tailwinds dissipate, like rates? Zach Wasserman : Erika, this is Zach. I'll take that one. And the answer to your question is yes. We in terms of that very much is a sign of our trying to look ahead. Look at not only 2023 but also over the entirety of the strategic plan in Horizon and ensure that we're setting up the overall financial performance in terms of revenue and the growth rate of overall expenses such that we can achieve the objectives in terms of profit growth -- that is a very deeply held objective and we're not looking in the short term, but in the long term to achieve it. As we talked about at Fairmont Investor Day, there are multiple strategic levers that we use to manage overall expenses to grow less than revenue to support that PPNR growth. And even as we drive a faster growth rate of the expenses -- or sorry, the investments within expenses to drive ultimately business growth over the long term, but the efficiency drivers, operation accelerate that is going in reengineering, major customer-facing processes, taking waste and cost out of the system as we improve productivity our long track record of optimizing the consumer and retail branch distribution network, which is still very relevant, still it made, but it does represent an opportunity over time to reduce and to harvest expense saves and things like this organizational alignment, which are designed to help us to improve efficiency and hold cost growth at a low level. I will note, it's in the guidance that I've given in terms of overall core expense growth for 2023. But importantly, also helps us to achieve our strategic objectives. Align our organization yet even more towards our most important strategic priorities and to operate as efficiently and at pace as we can. So, we are extremely focused on driving that long-term efficiency program, which is an important component of the PPNR guidance. And I do expect we'll achieve the financial medium-term targets this year. That's what's baked into an implied by our overall guidance. Rich Pohle : I think Erika, Steve, if I could add on just a bit and as you'll remember from the Investor Day deck, shared a number of economic scenarios. And we were asked a question and commented that we would take action that the scenarios that the economy worsened and the more challenging scenario emerged. We've already closed 32 branches this month we are taking action consistent with our prior statement and the commitment around driving towards these medium-term financial goals. We're looking ahead as well to \u201824 with how we're positioning the reinvestment off of the expense actions. So, team is doing a great job. It's a quick pivot, if you will, from a record year and a record quarter. But it's with a very clear set of actions and plan and we're executing. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thanks for your questions, Erika. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Just to follow-up on Erika's first question. You guys talked about your buyback being on pause because you're watching the path of the economy. In the first half, you talked a little bit about the economic outlook since the Investor Day was slightly worse, yet Rich, you sound pretty confident. It feels like you feel good about your credit outlook just help us square that a little bit more. Are you actually seeing erosion maybe outside of your portfolios? Or help us understand your overall thinking because it seems like it's pretty positive from my view. Rich Pohle : Well, I would say it's positive right now, and we're certainly cautious as we enter a downturn, but everything that I'm looking at right now, Jon, is holding water exactly where we thought it would be our delinquencies, both in commercial and consumer are right where we would expect them to be. We had a very sharp drop in our commercial delinquencies and our commercial real estate delinquencies are essentially nothing. The [indiscernible] momentum and NPA momentum that we've got both down 20% year-over-year, puts us in really good stead as we enter a downturn. So, we're looking at everything. Every portfolio we're going deep into to make sure that we're proactive in identifying potential issues and trying to get ahead of them in terms of working with customers as there's potential problems. But certainly, the headwinds are there in the economy, but we feel good about where the portfolio is positioned. Like I said, we're not going to bat 1,000. We do have higher losses forecasted in \u201823 than we had in \u201822. So, we understand that it's going to be a more challenging environment, but we feel good where we're sitting. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. And then can you guys\u2019 touch on the one fee line that stood out was Capital Markets. Can you touch on what you're seeing there? You talked about Capstone and then some of your other businesses. Are these referrals coming to Capstone internally. Is it business generated on their own? And what do you think there in terms of the longer-term runway? Zach Wasserman : In terms of -- so this Zach. I'll take that one. Capital markets is a real bright spot for us. the core underlying capital markets, excluding Capstone, grew 26% revenue year-over-year in 2022, and we expect another run rate of double-digit teams are above revenue growth as we go into '23. So, we're seeing just really sustained traction in the underlying strategy there is to deepen relationships with additional clients continue to penetrate that set of services and products into our core customer base and reap the benefits of it. It's been an area as you know that we've been investing in considerably over time, and we're seeing that play through into incremental revenue growth. And then Capstone to your point, is a nice addition to that. And I would tell you that Capstone is doing really, really well. They beat the plan for Q3. Overall, more than the $100 million run rate, if you look at the back half of revenues. I look at the back half of '22, and we expect that to continue and sustain and continue to grow as we go into '23. It's early days, I would say, in getting client referrals from the Huntington base, but at the beginning, we are seeing, particularly as late to the pipeline and in the future, a lot of positive engagement of core Huntington clients with the Capstone team and with the service set there. And so, it's going to be an area that there's continues to bear fruit and we're quite bullish about the opportunity to grow capstones what was previously $100 million revenue run rate up into something that continues to perform well and above that as we go forward over time. So, it's definitely a strong point at this point. Rich Pohle : I'll add to that a little bit, Jon, if I can. So, Capstone's had a good performance thus far. They had a very strong pipeline coming into the year. Obviously, multiples of change valuation is impacted by that. Timing becomes a little more uncertain. But we're really pleased with that. The integration into the bank channels is going very, very well. The core businesses, foreign exchange, a record year, Institutional Sales & Trading. Commodities has had a very good performance. So, a number of the businesses are doing very, very well at the core and expect that they'll continue to so that the laggard is, as you would expect, the rates businesses given the inverted curve and but this is a very strategic growth for us. We're continuing to invest in it and the integration of both Capstone and the combined efforts of our core teams and what you earn district at the Investor Day make us very bullish about '23 and beyond. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thank you, Jon. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Hey, I just wanted I just wanted to ask one back on credit. Just sort of in light of your updated economic assumptions, what sort of additional reserving needs do you think Huntington might have? I mean you're already starting with 190 plus reserve here. So, I mean does that seem sufficient in light of what you're thinking? Or would it continue to drift upward a bit? Rich Pohle : Scott, it's Rich. I'll take that. So, as you saw, we held our coverage levels flat in the second quarter then we had two incremental builds in Q3 and Q4. So, the 190 coverage that we're sitting with today, we think is fully reflective of the current economic scenario. Now where the reserve goes from there is really going to be a function in the short-term where the economy is having, we see significant degradation to react to that or that isn't as bad will react there. So, it's hard to answer it. We go through that process every quarter in terms of looking at the economic scenario that's in front of us and what the potential for improvement or degradation is, and we make the call at the end of the quarter based on all that. So, the near term is really going to depend on where the economy shapes up. I would say that longer term, as we've been past the downturn, however long it might be, we do think that we will bring the reserve coverage down over time. It's just a question of the timing around that. And then year-end reserves that reflects this adjusted thinking in terms of the baseline economic scenario goes off in the comment and a problem. Scott Siefers : Thank you and then it\u2019s just actually a piggyback question. Just the expense guidance for the full-year. I'm presuming that includes the restructuring charges to which you alluded earlier. I know you said you're talking in more detail about those later, but do you have maybe an approximate level of what we might expect just to get a sense for what the sort of underlying expense growth might look like from here on out? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Thanks, Scott, for asking the question. I want to take the opportunity to clarify. The guidance we've given is 2% to 4% growth in underlying core. And then on top of that, the run rate for Capstone, which is around $60 million plus the FDIC surcharge we estimate to be $33 million to be relatively precise about that. We have not yet fully sized the potential restructuring costs from the organizational alignment actions that Steve mentioned. So that is yet to be included in that guidance, just to put a very specific point on that. And there I don't expect it to be overly large, but we'll have to see, ultimately, it will be a function of a number of factors, including the final nature of the changes and importantly, as Steve noted, we're instituting a voluntary retirement program, which by a certain name has a function of employee selection and take up on their own and so they'll be some degree of variability until we have a sense of where that program lay in. So that -- more to come on that. There's a few opportunities during the first quarter for us to provide additional updates around the nature of the program and the size of our on and we intend to do that as we to get further out in the Q1. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Zach Wasserman : There's some pickup on that expense, that one-time expense that we would expect to see just in the run rate in \u201823, and there may be other things we can do to absorb that also not the forecast. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you all very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I just want to push on the buybacks. You've got almost 9.5% CET1 capital. You've got very strong reserves. You got a very strong capital generation, solid loan growth, but not good at consumer a ton of capital, seem pretty confident on credit. So, I guess I'm just trying to better understand why you wouldn't buy back stock in the first half and then just to kind of throw it out there, it feels like the uncertainty might increase as we look to the back half. So, what would make you kind of more confident to buy back in the second half heading into maybe more macro uncertainty? Zach Wasserman : Yes, Matt, it's a good question. I think just take a step back to probably to frame it. the expectation now as we get out over the course of the totality of '23 and certainly as we think about '24 and beyond to get back to a more normal mix overall payout ratios between dividends and share purchases and retaining capital to grow. And so, I think you could see this buyback is really just the program with the repurchase program as being indicative of that part of that, and I think a really healthy sign. And when we thought a little more tactically zooming in into the near term, I just really want to see the depth of the economic environment during the course of '23 before you make any substantive or significant commitments. And hopefully, the launch of that is understood. How long exactly does it take to get clarity to your point, is somewhat uncertain. I suspect we'll know a bit more over the course of Q1 and as we get into Q2. It's more resolved at that point than I think we'd be more active but still highly uncertain we'll have to see and be dynamic. But generally speaking, the size of the program was designed to keep us in the middle of our CET1 operating range over the course of the proceeding periods. And so that will be our plan to generally manage in that way. More clarity in the near term. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then as we think about potential uses of the capital besides buyback, just remind us your appetite for bolt-on deals and I guess, specifically within fees, right? Because we kind of step back right now in net interest income, maybe it\u2019s not peaking, but it\u2019s probably not going to be a key driver of growth as we get through this year and beyond? And I know you guys have been talking about kind of better balancing some of that fee mix over time. So, what\u2019s the appetite to do something, whether it\u2019s small or maybe bigger than you find in the past? Steve Steinour : Matt, it\u2019s Steve. We are interested in building our fee income opportunities and net revenue stream. And so, if we can find things that we think make sense, that would enhance our current business lines and/or what we can offer to our customers, we would be interested. Just as last year, we were fortunate to get cash on the board and a fintech opinions [indiscernible] So we\u2019ll be looking at the as the year progresses, whether it makes sense to bolster the acquisition on the fee side of our businesses. But that\u2019s not sort of an intended set aside on that buyback conclusions that just related. Our capital priorities haven\u2019t changed. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the floor back to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : So, thank you very much for joining us today. As you know, we're very pleased with the record year for Huntington and a third straight quarter of record net income, fourth straight quarter of PPNR growth. We come into this year with a lot of momentum. We think we're well positioned to manage through a model recession, and we remain committed to and confident of our ability to continue creating value for our shareholders. And as a reminder, the Board executives, our colleagues are a top 10 shareholder collectively, reflecting our strong alignment, strong alignment with our shareholders. So, thank you for your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

I would now let's turn the conference over to our host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today, are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.  With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our first quarter results which Zach will detail later.  Huntington is very well positioned. We operate a diversified franchise with disciplined risk management. Our approach to both our colleagues and customers is grounded in our purpose, to make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. And during times like these, Huntington's purpose is evident in how we look out for each other and serve as a source of strength for our customers and communities.  Now onto Slide 4. These are the key messages I want to highlight to you. First, we have one of the strongest deposit franchises of any regional bank. We have a diversified base of primary bank customer relationships, which has been built over many years supported by our fairplay philosophy. We also have the leading percentage of insured deposits as of year-end.  Second, we maintain a robust liquidity position consistent with our longstanding approach to conservative risk management practices. Third, our capital base is solid and building. Common equity tier one has increased for three quarters in a row, and we intend to continue to build to the high end of our range. Fourth, our credit reserves our top tier. Credit quality continues to perform exceptionally well and remains a hallmark of our disciplined credit management. Fifth, we are dynamically managing through the current environment, bolstering capital and liquidity. We're also incrementally optimizing the balance sheet and loan growth while continuing to proactively manage the expense base. Finally, we are well positioned operate through uncertainty with a focus on our long-term strategy and our commitment to top quartile returns. I believe Huntington is built to thrive during times like this, and ultimately to benefit and to capture opportunities as they arise. Moments of market disruption present opportunities to take market share, to win new customers and to hire great talent. We are confident in our strategy and strong position. Moving on to Slide 5, we entered this period of disruption in the best position the company has been since I've joined over a dozen years ago. The reputation our colleagues have created a best-in-class customer service, results in customer confidence and trust in us. The 2023 JD Power award for Customer Satisfaction reflects our colleagues' efforts. Grounded in our fairplay philosophy, we continue to acquire and deepen primary bank relationships, resulting in our granular and diversified deposit base. For many years, we focused on gathering deposits that are sticky operating accounts, and proactively placed larger deposits off balance sheet. We continue to invest across the franchise to drive deposit growth. We are also incrementally optimizing loan growth to generate the highest returns and ensure the capital we deploy is put to the highest and best use. And we remain focused on delivering the revenue synergies we previously shared, accelerating the growth of our fee businesses and deepening our customer relationships.  In regards to capital CET1 increased 19 basis points from the prior quarter to 9.55%. And we plan to build capital to the high end of our range over the course of 2023. Our credit reserves are top tier in the peer group at 1.9%. We will continue to be proactive in our expense management. In the first quarter, we completed a number of actions to support our ongoing efficiency programs such as the 31 branch consolidations, the voluntary retirement program, and our organizational realignment with reductions in personnel. And in addition to operation accelerate, we have a roadmap to deliver continued efficiencies going forward.  Importantly, risk management is embedded within all our business lines. At Huntington, everyone owns risk, and we continue to operate within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Finally, I want to reiterate, Huntington is built for times like this. We have a strong well diversified franchise with a distinctive brand and loyal customers.  Our high-quality deposit base, robust liquidity, and solid credit metrics are the direct result of focused and disciplined execution over many years. We have an experienced management team supported by highly engaged colleagues executing on our strategy. And as you know, management is collectively a top 10 shareholder. And we are fully committed to driving top tier performance and growing shareholder value. Zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our first quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.39, and adjusted EPS of $0.38. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE came in at 23.1% for the quarter, adjusted for notable items. ROTCE was 22.7%. Further adjusting for AOCI, ROTCE was 17.8%. Pre-provision net revenue expanded 41% year-over-year to $844 million.  Loan balances continued to grow, as total loans increased by $1.5 billion from the prior quarter. Liquidity coverage remains robust, with over $60 billion of available liquidity representing a peer leading coverage of uninsured deposits of 136%. Credit quality remains strong, with a net charge-offs of 19 basis points and allowance for credit losses of 1.9%. Turning to Slide 7. Average loan balances increased 1.3% quarter-over-quarter driven by commercial loans, which increased by $1.5 billion, or 2.2% from the prior quarter. Primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance, which increased $800 million tied to continued normalization of dealer inventory levels, as well as seasonality, with shipments of spring equipment arriving to dealers. Corporate and specialty banking increased $242 million, primarily driven by growth in mid-corp, healthcare and tech and telecom. Other assets financed businesses contributed growth of $216 million. Auto floorplan continued normalization, with balances higher by $214 million. Business banking also increased $92 million.  In consumer, growth continued to be led by residential mortgage which increased by $316 million. Partially offsetting this growth were home equity balances, which declined by $159 million. All other categories including RV Marine and auto declined by a collective $123 million. Turning to Slide 8. We continued to deliver average deposit growth in the first quarter. Balances were higher by $472 million, primarily driven by consumer, which more than offset lower commercial balances. On a year-over-year basis, average deposits increased by $3.2 billion or 2.3%. Turning to Slide 9. I want to share more details behind Huntington's deposit franchise. Our deposit base represents a leading percentage of insured deposits at 69% as of Q1. Our deposit base is highly diversified with consumer deposits representing over half of our total deposits and the average consumer balance being $11,000. Turning to Slide 10. Complementing our diversified deposit base is the stability and growth of our deposits over time. During last year, we consistently delivered deposit growth well above peer levels despite the backdrop of rising rates and quantitative tightening. Through year-end 2022, cumulative deposit growth was 2.4%, nearly 6 percentage points better than the peer median. Over the course of Q1, monthly average deposit balances were stable at approximately $146 billion. Within consumer deposits, balances have increased for four months in a row. Total commercial balances were modestly lower, consistent with expected seasonality. During March, in addition to seasonality, commercial customers also incrementally utilized our off-balance sheet liquidity solutions. Turning to Slide 11. We have a sophisticated approach to customer liquidity management that comprises both on balance sheet deposit products as well as off-balance sheet alternatives. Over the past four years, we have invested substantially to build out these solutions to ensure we're managing our customers' overall liquidity needs. The enhanced liquidity solutions allow us to manage the full customer relationship with primary bank and operating deposits on balance sheet and utilizing our off-balance sheet solutions for investment or non-operational funds. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, we intentionally leveraged these off-balance sheet solutions in order to support our customers' excess liquidity. This resulted in fewer surge deposits coming on sheet as well as less commercial deposit runoff during 2022 compared to the industry.  On a year-over-year basis, our Commercial Banking segment on balance sheet deposits increased 11% and our off-balance sheet liquidity balances increased 54%. During March, this approach yet again showed its value for both Huntington and our customers. We saw customers moving a modest amount of deposit balances into treasuries and other products, while we were able to maintain those primary operating accounts on our balance sheet. Of the total change in Commercial segment deposit balances between March 6 and the end of Q1, we estimate that approximately half the delta was attributable to normal seasonality, and the remainder was mainly the result of shifts into our off-balance sheet solutions.  The bottom table highlights these movements as well as trends in the first two weeks of April. On-balance sheet deposits have returned to the March 6 level and off-balance sheet continues to grow. Turning to Slide 12. Our liquidity capacity is robust. Our two primary sources of liquidity, cash and borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve represented $10 billion and $51 billion, respectively, at the end of Q1. As part of our ongoing liquidity management, we continually seek to maximize contingent borrowing capacity. And as of April 14, our total cash and available borrowing capacity increased to $65 billion. At quarter-end, this pool of available liquidity represented 136% of total uninsured deposits, a peer leading coverage. On to Slide 13. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $53 million or 4% to $1.418 billion driven by lower day count and lower net interest margin. Year-over-year, NII increased $264 million or 23%. Net interest margin decreased 12 basis points on a GAAP basis from the prior quarter and decreased 11 basis points on a core basis, excluding accretion. The reduction in GAAP NIM included 5 basis points from lower spreads, net of free funds, due to funding mix and marginally accelerated interest costs. It also included 5 basis points from the first substantive negative carry impact from our long-term downrate NIM hedging program and 3 basis points from higher cash levels. Slide 14 highlights our ongoing disciplined management of deposit costs and funding. For the current cycle to date, our beta on total cost of deposits was 25%. As we've noted, we expect deposit rates to continue to trend higher from here over the course of the rate cycle. Given the recent market environment, at the margin, we do expect a steeper near term trajectory. Turning to Slide 15. Our hedging program is dynamic, continually optimized and well diversified. Our objectives are to protect capital in up-rate scenarios and to protect NIM in down-rate scenarios. During the first quarter, we added to the hedge portfolio with both of these objectives in mind. On the capital protection front, we added $1.6 billion in additional pay fixed swaps and $1.5 billion in forward starting pay fixed swaptions. Throughout the quarter, we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset sensitivity. We also incrementally added to our hedge position to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term as well as took actions to optimize the near-term cost of the program.  During the quarter, we executed a net $400 million of received fixed swaps, terminated $4.9 billion of swaps and entered into $5 billion of floor spreads. As we've noted before, our intention is to manage NIM in as tight a corridor as possible as we protect the downside and maintain upside potential if rates stay higher for longer. Turning to Slide 16. On the securities portfolio, we saw another step up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We benefited from higher reinvestment yields as well as our hedges to protect capital. From a portfolio strategy perspective, we expect to continue to add to the allocation of shorter duration exposures to benefit from the inverted yield curve and further enhance the liquidity profile of the portfolio. You will note that fair value marks at the end of March were lower than year-end, both in the AFS and HTM portfolios, as market interest rates moved lower sequentially. Importantly, we have also shown the $700 million total positive fair value mark from our pay fixed hedges, which are intended to protect capital. Moving on to Slide 17. Non-interest income was $512 million, up $13 million from last quarter. These results include the $57 million gain on the sale of our retirement plan services business during the quarter. Excluding that gain, adjusted non-interest income was $455 million. This result was somewhat lower than the guidance we provided in early March, driven by lower capital markets revenues given the disruptions at the end of Q1.  The first quarter is generally a seasonal low for fee revenues. As we've noted previously, we see Q1, excluding the RPS sale, being the low point and for fees to grow over the course of the year, driven by solid underlying performance in our key areas of strategic focus capital markets, payments and wealth management. Moving on to Slide 18. GAAP noninterest expense increased by $9 million. Adjusted for notable items, core expenses decreased by $18 million, driven by lower personnel expense, primarily as a result of reduced incentives and revenue driven compensation. We're proactively managing expenses and have taken actions over the last several quarters to orient to a low level of expense growth in order to deliver positive operating leverage and self-fund strategic investments. Slide 19 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 increased to 9.55% and has increased sequentially for three quarters. OCI impacts to common equity Tier 1 resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 7.6%. As a reminder, the reported regulatory capital framework does not include OCI impacts in the capital calculation. Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, increased 22 basis points to 5.7%. Note that we were holding higher cash balances at the end of Q1, which reduced the TCE ratio by 13 basis points. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.27%. Tangible book value per share increased by 7% from the prior quarter to $7.32. Adjusting for AOCI, tangible book value increased to $9.23, and has increased for the past four quarters. Our capital management strategy for the balance of 2023 will result in expanding capital over the course of the year, while maintaining our top priority to fund high-return loan growth. We intend to grow CET1 to the top end of our 9% to 10% operating range by the end of the year. We believe this is a prudent approach given the dynamic environment.  Based on our expectation for continued loan growth, we do not expect to utilize the share repurchase program during 2023. Turning to Slide 20. Our capital plus reserves is top quartile in the peer group and gives us substantial total loss absorption capacity. On Slide 21, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 19 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 2 basis points and up 12 basis points from the prior year as charge-offs continue to normalize. Non-performing assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for seven consecutive quarters. Allowance for credit losses was flat at 1.9% of total loans. Turning to Slide 22. We have provided incremental disclosures on our commercial real estate balances. This portfolio is well diversified and at 14% of total loans is in line with the peer group with no outsized exposures. The majority of the property types are multifamily and industrial. Over the last two years, we have grown our CRE book at a slower pace relative to the industry and peers. We remain conservative in our credit approach to CRE with rigorous client selection. Total office CRE comprises less than 2% of total loans, and the majority are suburban and multi-tenant properties. Reserve coverage on our total CRE portfolio is 3% and the office portfolio is 8%. Let's turn to our 2023 outlook on Slide 23. As we have discussed, we analyze multiple potential economic scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans. We also remain dynamic in the current environment as we execute on our strategies. Our guidance is anchored on a baseline scenario that is informed by the consensus economic outlook. We have also based our guidance on a range of interest rate scenarios, bounded on the low end using the forward curve as of the end of March to one at the higher end, where rates are higher for longer with Fed funds remaining at approximately today's level over the rest of the year. On loans, our outlook range continues to be growth between 5% and 7% on an average basis. And as before, we expect this growth to be led by commercial with more modest growth in consumer. As we entered the year, we were trending to the middle to higher portion of that growth range. Given the market disruption and our incremental focus on optimizing loan growth for the highest returns on capital, we now expect to be in the lower half to midpoint of this range. On deposits, we are guided by our core strategy of acquiring and deepening primary bank relationships. We're narrowing our outlook with a slightly lower top end of the range and still expect to grow average deposits between 1% and 3%. However, the composition of deposit growth from here, we now expect to be primarily consumer-led with relatively less commercial growth. Net interest income is now expected to increase between 6% and 9%. This is driven by slightly lower loan growth and marginally higher funding costs. Non-interest income on a core full year basis is expected to be flat to down 2%. The updated guidance reflects modestly lower expected growth in capital markets fees and includes the go-forward impact of the RPS business sale. As noted, we expect Q1 to be the low point for fees, growing over the course of the year, led by capital markets, payments and Wealth Management. On expenses, we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a very low level. We're benefiting from our ongoing efficiency initiatives, such as Operation Accelerate, branch optimization, the voluntary retirement program and the organizational realignment, providing the capacity to self-fund sustained investment in our key growth initiatives. Given a somewhat lower revenue outlook, we are taking actions to incrementally reduce the expense growth in 2023. For the full year, we now expect core expense growth between 1% and 3%, plus the incremental expenses from the full year run-rate of Capstone and Torana and the increased FDIC insurance expense.  Overall, our low expense growth, coupled with expanded revenues, is expected to support another year of positive operating leverage. We continue to expect net charge-offs will be on the low end of our long-term through-the-cycle range of 25 to 45 basis points. Finally, turning to Slide 24. As you heard from Steve, the foundation we have built at Huntington over the last decade has created an institution that is well prepared for this environment. We will leverage the strength of our deposit base. We're focused on growing capital and maintaining robust liquidity. We remain disciplined in our credit posture, and we're executing our core strategy.  The work we have done to build the franchise positions Huntington to outperform and be ready to opportunistically seize on pockets of growth. We will remain disciplined and dynamic in our management approach as we continue to generate long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy of peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we will conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. Tim Sedabres : Good morning, Manan. Manan Gosalia : As I look through your deposit flows for the quarter, you've clearly done better than peers, whether it's on total deposits or even just non-interest-bearing deposits. Can you break out what you saw in the background? Was there a lot of movement with new accounts coming in and some of those existing commercial clients moving off balance sheet? And if so, can you talk about how sticky you think some of those new account openings are? Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Manan. This is Zach. I'll take that question, and it's a good one. Overall, what we saw in our deposit base during the quarter was tremendous stability and that continued, not only through the month of March, but into early April. And we've tried to provide some incremental disclosures around that, so that you could get the visibility.  And for us, it's not surprising as we've noted quite a bit. It's very granular, very diversified and, overall, it didn't happen by accident, it was a function of a really long strategy we have to focus on primary bank relationships, as you know. And to develop this commercial off balance sheet capability that we described in the prepared remarks. To get to your question, in particular, what we saw generally, I would note, by the way, that when you're looking at balances on a day-by-day basis as we've provided them in that disclosure, you have to take them with a note of caution. It really matters what day of the week what week of the month, et cetera payroll days and tax payments, et cetera.  Generally, we expect the end of March to be a seasonal low for commercial. And so most of the movement, around half the move we saw in commercial from, let's say, the average of March down to the end of March was really just BAU movements of commercial clients largely paying out payroll.  The other half was largely movements of deposits off balance sheet as very marginal amount of customers used some of those off-balance sheet solutions to leverage that product set. Interestingly, what you can see, we provide this disclosure out into the first two weeks of April is that essentially completely came back in terms of the overall balance of commercial deposits. So it's very stable net, virtually no movement. On the question of what we saw ins and outs, we, of course, saw some acquisition and we continue to acquire in every segment that we're operating in, consumers, continue to acquire [ph] business banking and commercial as well. And so we feel good about that kind of long-term program, which is one of the things that underlies our continued expectation for its positive growth throughout the rest of this year, just continuing to stay on strategy of acquiring and deepening primary banking relationships. Manan Gosalia : Great. And then just separately, can you talk about the funding and liquidity side of the balance sheet? So despite the low level of deposit outflow, I think you built up some cash and liquidity levels by taking on more wholesale funding. So how should we think about that as we get through the rest of this year? Zach Wasserman : Yeah. In terms of overall funding mix, we've talked about this a number of times in prior quarters. We really like where we are coming to this rate cycle from a perspective of lots of balanced options to fund the business. We're growing loans at this point between 5% and 7% and deposits are between 1% and 3%, around 2%, call it, the midpoint of that range. So that allows us to also leverage other sources of funding to overall fund the balance sheet, and we're in a great position to be able to do that. I will tell you, internally, we really like that. It creates quite a bit of attention in the system where the next unit of of funding is coming and really that is optimized from an economic perspective. And so our expectation is to continue to essentially add to each of those funding categories over the foreseeable future while still maintaining a level that's comparatively quite good relative to history for us. So that's the overall plan.  On the topic of liquidity, I would just note a couple of things. This is a key risk that the company has been focused on managing for more than a decade. We purposely create exceptionally robust pools of convention liquidity to cover any potential issue. I think we noted in the prepared -- in the deck some of the key sources of, and also noted that we continue to, over time, add to them. I will tell you that one of the statistics that's in the document today highlights $65 billion of contingent cash and borrowing capacity as of last Friday. I'm pleased to report that as of this morning, based on incremental efforts we've done now $84 million, which, in total, represents 187% of relative to our term deposits. So exceptionally strong liquidity profile, and, as I said, kind of very balanced funding mix. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please state your question. John Pancari : Good morning. You mentioned the actions you've taken incrementally to lower expense growth across the firm. Are those actions factored into your 1% to 3% expense guidance? And also what are those actions involved? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yeah. It's a great question, John. This is Zach. I'll elaborate on that. So the short answer to your question is yes. Our guidance of 1% to 3% underlying core growth includes those actions. And I think just back to the sort of strategic intent of it, as we've said for a while, we are very intense on driving a low level of overall expense growth and really leveraging our ongoing program of efficiency initiatives to do that even while we continue to drive outsized growth and self-fund investments within that overall low growth framework.  And so as we came into this updated guidance period, and we saw somewhat lower revenue trajectory. For us, it was important and to kind of continue to execute on the discipline of driving the positive operating leverage to also ratchet down expenses. I think the kind of things that we do, we always enter the year with a contingent set of expense management options menu, you could think about it as a different kind of options we could undertake if we need to. And that's essentially what we're going to go through now. We'll modulate the pace of hiring. We'll be very judicious in the discretionary expense categories, and we will look at sort of every possible area of expense control to ratchet back expenses and offset a good amount of what was otherwise profit and revenue pressure.  So that's the playbook, and we -- that's something we've done numerous signs over the course of the years. And so we feel really good about our ability to do it again now. John Pancari : Okay. Great. All right. And then on the -- back to the balance sheet. Can you just give us your expectation in terms of an updated through cycle deposit beta? I believe you had expected 35% previously. But if you can update us there on what you're thinking, and also what net interest margin outlook is baked into your up 6% to 9% net interest income projection? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : You got it. Let me elaborate more on that. Overall, pulling back, overall, the strategy we have is to continue to drive sustained growth in net interest income on a dollar basis, and to do that, driving continual growth in higher-term loan categories coupling that with the management of NIM around in a tight corridor as we can, where the top end benefits from our continued asset sensitivity and we stand to really benefit if rates do stay a lot higher for longer, but also at the lower end, protected with our hedge portfolio. And all that adds up to the 6% to 9% NII growth that we're guiding to. On beta, in particular to your question, it clearly is a market-positive environment, and, hence, it's realistic to expect some higher beta and, frankly, an earlier impact than we had previously seen. I do expect now a few percentage points higher than the original -- than the prior guidance of 35% beta. I will note that we provide a guidance on beta because we want to give you an indication of where we think that's going. But for us, the most important thing is the execution day-to-day of driving the deposit growth and staying incredibly disciplined in terms of the overall funding mix as I noted in my prior response. How beta ultimately plays out here over the end game is going to be clearly a function of where the yield curve goes. But I do think that a few -- a few percent higher than 35% is a reasonable range based on the new scenarios I laid out.  In terms of overall spread, as we noted, we've moved the guidance range from what was previously 8% to 11% to 6% to 9%, so down about 2% in terms of that guidance range. About 40% of that is just slightly lower loan growth and the rest is spread. As I think about the kind of the way the year plays out, I would expect that kind of a more front-loaded impact of spreads than we were previously expecting. So we would expect to see $1 decline in NII, in Q2 about the same as we saw in Q1, but then growing from there. And I think the NIM range that we have there is sort of consistent with that dollar trends. John Pancari : Great. Thanks, Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please state your question. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Two questions. One, in terms of the deposit growth outlook, I think you mentioned it's expected to be more consumer-led. Just give us a sense of strategically how either the interest rate environment or the events of the last month have changed how you're thinking about deposit acquisition? And has it materially changed the pricing on new deposit growth relative to the how you thought about it back in January? Rich Pohle : Yeah. Thanks, Ebrahim. Overall, I would say, as we noted, tighten the range with a kind of a lower top end but still expect growth and pretty consistent with what we had thought before in terms of the overall amount growth. So we still see nice traction -- and I think we've seen that a little bit in some of the disclosures we've given just in the first month of the first week of into, for example.  With that being said, I think the mix will be different. And we now expect commercial to be largely flat from here. And really the growth to be consumer-led. Frankly, from our perspective, it's a great highlight of the strength of the consumer franchise that we've got that we can lean in now and continue to support high profit loan growth with that consumer funding. I think the dust has not fully settled in terms of all of the competitive and customer behavioral impacts of the last month, but I think one of them will clearly be more moderated commercial growth that will just be leveraging off-balance sheet structures that much more. So I'm sure that what we do have on sheet is incredibly stable. And on the consumer side, it's just running the same playbook that we have. And we have invested so much over the last few years and capabilities to build our marketing technology and customer targeting capability with the consumer that we really have the opportunity to optimize and to drive incremental consumer-oriented acquisition, not only of higher rate categories, but just fundamentally, we're growing -- we noted 2% growth in primary bank relationships on the Consumer side, 4% growth in business banking. And so it's a very balanced source of growth, and we just going to lead into it at this point to continue to grow overall balances. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just as a follow-up, I guess, on the lending side. So I appreciate your comments in terms of where the growth has been in the outlook. But if you could give us a sense of just customer sentiment, given your business mix, some of the legacy TCF businesses, just the health of the economy in terms of when you speak to your customers, are you seeing a slowdown in demand also occurring at the same time, which increases the likelihood of a potential downturn and a recession based on what you're saying? Steve Steinour : Ebrahim, this is Steve, and thank you for the question. We are seeing customers become more cautious, in some cases, deferring investments and/or postponing on acquisitions or other transactions. And this has increased during the quarter, it's one of the reasons we've sort of guided without changing the loan range to the lower end of that low range from where we would have been at the upper end of that loan rate at the end of '22.  There's a clear -- clearly more angst about, is there a recession, and what 2024 looks. Having said that, many of these customers are doing quite well in '23 thus far and remain optimistic. But again, there's been a lot of media, a lot of headline noise and it's having an impact in addition to what the Fed's doing. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thanks, Steve. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Ebrahim. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please state your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Hey, Zach, I was hoping you could expand upon some of the NII comments from a question or so ago. So I think if I interpreted you correctly, I guess, NII will take a step down in the second quarter. What would cause that margin or NII to start expanding from there in light of, I guess, fairly limited overall balance sheet growth through the remainder of the year? Just curious about the nuances as you see them. Zach Wasserman : Yeah. I mean, mainly, it's going to be volume from there, Scott, just continue to sequentially grow loans from second into the third and third into the fourth quarter is the primary driver. We see the spreads much more flat in the back half than kind of accelerated impact. What I -- just to make elaborating a little bit on kind of the NIM trajectory that we see overly precise. When we walked into the year, we were expecting, frankly, a pretty ratable trend in NIM over the course of the year. I think at the time we provided some guidance around single-digit basis points kind of trajectory throughout the course of the year.  Most of that we now see kind of front-loaded just based on the shape of the curve and kind of how the outlook has shaped up at this point. So that's really the driver. Overall, my outlook for NIM is going to be 5 or 6 basis points lower on a 400 basis to give you a sense a portion of which is yield with both of which is just funding costs being slightly higher. Scott Siefers : Okay. Steve Steinour : Remember, we are a large equipment finance lender. And that generally has much more activity in the fourth quarter. That's part of this second half build-a-tech, records. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then can you guys speak broadly to some of the trends you're seeing in the auto portfolio. I mean I know your portfolio, just given the quality and tenure of it, it tends to be a lot different than the industry as a whole. But at least in the media, you would think the industry is sort of collapsing, I guess. Just curious at top level trying to sort of appetite from you guys and then what you're seeing at sort of overall? Rich Pohle : Scott, it's Rich. I can take that and then Zach and Steve can tack on to it. So from my standpoint, on the credit side, as we showcased during Investor Day, I mean, this is really a business we like through all sorts of cycles. I mean it just become truly the core competency of the bank.  If you look at what we saw in the first quarter, it was a continued gradual normalization in both delinquencies and charge-offs. But it's still trending well below the historic losses that we would normally see. It was 14 basis points in the first quarter, up from 12 in the fourth quarter. From my standpoint, I look really closely at the origination metrics that we've got, we're still originating at FICOs north of 17-18 and the loan to values are remaining relatively constant, reflecting a little bit more mix in new versus used.  So from my standpoint, we're going to expect this portfolio to continue to surpass [ph] that past performance. And unemployment rates are still low, which is certainly going to help the credit metrics here. That's the big driver of losses. So I'm feeling good about it. And maybe Zach can talk about the optimization that we've got from a return on capital standpoint. Zach Wasserman : Sure. I'll just tack on to that. Just I second the comment that the first feel great about the trajectory of the portfolio and we still see sustained demand and great relationships by the way, by a dealer. So I think we're a core and integral funding partner for our dealers, which really gives us great access.  In terms of optimization, that is one of the loan categories that we are actively modulating. We kind of detailed this at Investor Day last November, should you remember, that's a business that is so effectively managed with respect to pricing and volume trade-offs that you can really pull those levers quite effectively to drive higher return and higher yield times that we want to need to, and this is certainly one of them. And so we're bringing back production a bit and seeing really strong returns as a result of it.  So we'll see some of that and continue to optimize as we go forward for the rest of the year. But that is still a really important business for us and one we're pleased with kind of where we have seen it. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you for all the color. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please state your question. Zach Wasserman : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian : I just had 1 follow-up question for Steve. Steve, your starting point of CET1 is 9.5%. You accrete about 20 basis points of capital or more in the quarter. And like you said, your allowance already accounts for a tougher economic environment. I think your shareholders absolutely appreciate the focus on returns. But do you see an opportunity for Huntington to perhaps, as we have a little bit more clarity on the downside to the macro backdrop, take advantage of that capital and reserve resilience, so to speak, and perhaps start thinking about being more opportunistic in market share taking? Steve Steinour : Yeah, Erika, thanks for the question. We do -- we have focused on and will continue throughout the year building the capital position of the company, strengthening it. We're quite pleased with the results delivered in the first quarter and look for comparable results as we go through the year. We're intending to be at or near the high end of our CET1 rank. And we're doing that with a view that this threat of a recession is increasing. And there's also a backdrop of that there's going to be some kind of regulatory action at some point in the foreseeable future around capital requirements. So with that in mind, that's the purpose of it. Having said that, we intend to be opportunistic. We've got a lot of organic growth potential in the business lines. We're very focused on our execution. And as you saw last year with the acquisition of Capstone and Torana, we're always looking to build out ancillary fee businesses within the company.  Beyond that, in times of disruptions, there tend to be people or teams that might be available, and we will again be -- look to be opportunistic there. And we see this in aggregate as a moment to take market share, and that's what we're driving towards. We're investing the businesses. The outlook Zach has shared with you, we'll have continued investment in the businesses, all of which is designed to enhance our flow our earnings and enhance our returns. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just to be clear, Steve, I was asking about organic opportunities. That wasn't a hidden bank acquisition question. Steve Steinour : Well, I'm glad you clarified that. I thought, you might go in a different direction. Erika Najarian : Yeah, absolutely. And just as a follow-up to that, Zach, heard you loud and clear in terms of continuing to optimize the right-hand side of your balance sheet. As you think about senior debt issuance, I suspect that everything that you may be doing in the future would have lens towards the potential for TLAC eligibility. Zach Wasserman : It's certainly on the thought process, yes, we're watching that development carefully. Still pretty early days, clearly to see where that might play in, but it's part of the thought process. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please state your question. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just 1 follow-up on the capital front. Zach, you show on that Slide 19, where the current potential impact of AFS would be on CET1. I'm just wondering, do you have a rule of thumb if we kept all rates equal on just how fast that would pull to par either on a sequential basis or maybe by the end of '24? Zach Wasserman : Yeah, it's a great question, and a considerable analysis of this. It's around 5% to 10% a year kind depending on which year in it is which our maturities are so like a totally flat curve basis. I'll give you a sense, we've just read this analysis on the forward curve as of March, it will be 42% recaptured by the end of 2024 in a forward curve scenario is benefiting in that one of interest rates declining relative to [indiscernible] scenario. Ken Usdin : Great. Thank you. And just 1 question on the asset repricing side. You guys have some fixed rate assets that are still repricing even though I understand how you're slowing production. Just can you give us a sense on just what your front book, back book benefits are in some of your fixed rate portfolios? And have we even really started to see some of those benefits come through given where rates have moved to? Zach Wasserman : Yeah, it's a great question. We look at that very carefully. And we're seeing really nice step-up in loan yields. To give you a sense, new volume rates up almost 50 basis points -- sorry, new volume up almost 70 basis points, back book up almost 50 basis points in Q1. We estimate that our loan beta at this point through Q1 is 37%, and that could easily be over the next couple of years approaching 60% so if you just sort of model the yield curve.  So we're a little further through the loan beta than we are at the deposit beta, but not much. And there's certainly much more room to go in terms of loan yields from here. Just given kind of about just over 10% of the portfolio in auto, that turns pretty quick, just over two years. So going to get the benefit of that repricing and some at delays but impactful beta there. And then obviously, the sort of the longer-dated loan book likewise is seeing a nice reset in terms of rates, and it's about a benefit for us over the coming quarters as well. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks, Zach. Operator : Next question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please state your question. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A few questions here. Zach, on Slide 14, that green line on the bottom, the last time you said, it took a couple of quarters for deposit cost to roll over after the Fed stop. If we're done in May, do you think that relationship holds? Does it -- is it two quarters and deposit costs stopped going up? Is that fair? Zach Wasserman : That's generally the expectation we've got, John, yes, based on just the prior basis. Obviously, the [indiscernible], it could be a kind of function of the pace with which rates might begin to decline and also what the kind of economic environment, hence, the loan growth environment across the industry that would affect the competitive environment of deposits. So that will clearly play into it. But generally, our planning assumption is, as you know, which is very much in keeping with what we've seen, not only in the last year's cycle, but in multiple recycles for that. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Fair enough. Steve or Rich, maybe for one of you. You used the term in the deck rigorous client selection for commercial real estate. Can you talk a little bit more about that, what you go through? Help us understand the type of work you do and do you think this is different than what your peers are doing? Rich Pohle : I really can't speak to what our peers are doing, but I can tell you that we, for four years now, have developed a process of really fine-tuning who we do business with in this space. As you know, real estate cycles and you have to be able to depend on who you're doing business with to support the projects. And so we really narrowed the funnel around the types of the sponsors that we work with. And we said -- we cure them. We look at their -- just how long they've been in business. We look at their financial wherewithal. We look at their liquidity. And more importantly, we look at how they've behaved in past cycles.  And we cure them and are curing how much we'll have out to any particular sponsor how [indiscernible] single project we will have to them and other metrics associated with that. So we -- right now, we are focused on serving the core and that has served us well going forward. Steve Steinour : Jon, we're always disciplined in our credit. And I think that's going to prove to be the case as we come through the cycle. Obviously, pleased with where we are at the moment. So we'll see. But I can tell you, especially in [indiscernible] where we had enormous challenges in '08-'09 we have sustained a discipline here since that time. And Rich has been a big part a bit along with that, our lending fees. Jon Arfstrom : Good. One more for you, Steve. I know this seems like a softball, but if not, I'm genuinely curious. But what surprised you the most over the past six weeks as you manage through some of this disruption? Steve Steinour : The speed of the one on the banks was a surprise, Jon, faster than that we've seen that I can ever recall. And I think, as a consequence, it lead -- the regulators and others, maybe a little behind what they would become they didn't expected either. And that's why I think it's a couple of weeks to go as we be resolved and signature as well. Normally, there's more front-end planning. They have a chance to line things up. This turned into a little bit more of a scramble. Having said that, I thought the reaction that something from treasury and as just -- it was just outstanding timing and fully appropriate. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan Chase. Please state your question. Steven Alexopoulos : Hi, everybody. Steve Steinour : Hi, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : I want to start. So on the net interest income, outlook, which has taken down a bit. Given everything is actually detailed on the swaps and the forward curve, as of right now, where do you see yourself trending within that? Is there a bias either to the upside or downside within that range right now? Zach Wasserman : When we set these ranges, we try to set them with our general expectation to be the right at the midpoint. So that's kind of the baseline expectation. I think kind of what -- the puts and takes that would take you to the high and the low end codes volume on one hand just sort of the shape of the yield curve and the competitive drive on the other hand.  So it's hard to generalize, but we feel quite good about landing in that range at this point, and that\u2019s what we're driving for. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. And is the way we should think about it, so if we're at the low end, say, of the NII range, should then we should be at the low end of the expense guidance? Should we just connect those 2? Zach Wasserman : Generally speaking, that is the way we think about it. We throttled the expense growth based on where the revenue trajectory is going. And that's why we try to have a really disciplined forecasting process with as we've said, multiple economics in there so we try to do that. Obviously, the expense level takes some time to pull. And so you need to have a good line of sight to where that's going and it's possible if there's a rapid move but a surprising movement, but that's not possible at given short time period, but over the longer term, yes. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. Okay. So maybe just one last one for Steve. Just following up on your response just now to Jon's question, given the speed at which deposits went out, Silicon Valley Bank, when you look at that, do you view that from a distance as a unique one-off event? Or are there lessons that you're now applying the way you think about managing capital risk, liquidity that even a stable regional bank like yourself will change potentially fairly materially than the aftermath of what we just saw? Thanks. Steve Steinour : Steve, I think there are always lessons learned. But the business model is of SVB and Signature were so different from us and other regional banks, but particularly from us. The concentrations of the uninsured deposit level of 95%, just in retrospect, it seems rather clear that the liquidity risk was very, very different and a huge miss combined with their asset liability. In terms of lessons for us, even that much more aware of liquidity.  We've always seen this as a prime risk. We've always had good back up, and we've been very granular and advantaged to have that best-in-class uninsured to total deposit ratio. But we'll probably be even more cautious, not probably, we will be even more cautious given the speed at which things move as we go forward.  Having said all that, we're in a very strong position today. We expect to grow deposits as we continue through the year. And so it's like extra vigilance. We may give some policy adjustments to reinforce and strengthen further, but that will be of a minor nature, I don't think it will impact our performance. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : So thank you very much for joining us today. And as you've heard, we're operating from a position of strength with the foundation that's been built over a long period of time. We're very, very focused on continued growth and intend to be opportunistic. We're confident in our ability to continue creating value for shareholders. And as a reminder, the Board executives and our colleagues are a top 10 shareholder collectively, reflecting our strong alignment with our shareholders.  So thank you for your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington Bancshares. Thank you. You may begin. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting about 1 hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our second quarter results which Zach will detail later. Our approach to both our colleagues and customers continues to be grounded in our purpose and served us well in the second quarter. Our colleagues again demonstrated that we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. Now on to Slide 4; these are the key messages we want to highlight today. First, Huntington has a distinguished deposit franchise which continues to benefit from our strategy to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships. This has fueled continued deposit growth over the year, including this quarter. Second, we once again drove capital ratios higher with common equity Tier 1 having increased for 4 quarters in a row. We remain on track to build CET1 to the high end of our range by year-end. Third, credit quality which is a hallmark of the company is performing very well and we continue to operate within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Fourth, we are dynamically managing through the interest rate environment. We are maintaining disciplined deposit pricing while delivering deposit growth and maintaining a robust liquidity position. Finally, we remain intently focused on executing our strategy. We are investing in the business to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth and we continue to proactively manage the expense base to align with the revenue outlook. Operation accelerate remains on track and we will increase our use of business process outsourcing to drive sustained efficiencies into 2024. Moving on to Slide 5; over the past decade, we've transformed Huntington. This puts us in a position of strength today. This foundation includes our granular and high-quality deposit base which is supported by our leading consumer, business and commercial banking franchises. With this strong foundation in place, we can be nimble and seasonal opportunities to expand our business that will arise during times like these. The hiring of the fund finance team we announced last month is a great example. This business was on our Commercial Banking growth road map and we're pleased to be able to add great talent and welcome these colleagues to Huntington. We are building capital even as we maintain loan growth. We are optimizing the level of new loan growth and remaining judicious for the loans we carry on balance sheet in order to generate the highest return on capital. As a result, capital ratios expanded in the second quarter with our CET1 ratio increasing to 9.82%. Further, our adjusted CET1 ratio is 8.12% above the peer median. Our disciplined approach to risk management drives our strong credit quality with low net charge-offs and the nonperforming asset ratio decreasing for the eighth consecutive quarter. Our management team has a long track record of being disciplined operators with a focus on delivering value for shareholders. This execution has been awarded and recognized across the franchise, including winning the J.D. Power Mobile Award for the fifth year in a row and maintaining our strong number one SBA ranking. Regarding the macro outlook, it remains a dynamic environment; interest rates are playing out in the higher for longer scenario that we had been anticipating for some time. Economic activity in our footprint appears to be holding up relatively well which supports sustained loan growth and solid credit performance. That said, we are diligent watching the environment closely and are actively managing our loan portfolio. We are well prepared to operate through a range of potential scenarios. Further, we are also closely monitoring the potential regulatory adjustments to capital and other requirements. We are evaluating the proposals and thus far, the potential new requirements appear broadly in line with what we had expected. We are well positioned to manage through these changes, address them expediently and over time, offset a meaningful portion of the potential impacts. And finally, before I hand it over to Zach, we want to share that Rich Pohle, our Chief Credit Officer, has announced his upcoming retirement effective at the end of 2023. We've greatly benefited from Rich's expertise and leadership during his nearly 12 years with Huntington. He's been a great leader of our colleagues and a great partner for me and the executive team. We have a strong bench and we're pleased Brendan Lawlor, Deputy Chief Credit Officer, will succeed Rich in this role at the end of the year. Brendan joined us in 2019 after 25-plus years as a Senior Commercial Credit Executive at a large regional bank and is currently responsible for all commercial credit across the bank. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our second quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.35. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 19.9% for the quarter. Further adjusting for AOCI, ROTCE was 15.8%. Deposits grew during the quarter, increasing by $2.7 billion or 1.9% on an end-of-period basis. Loan balances continue to grow as total loans increased by $900 million or 0.8% from the prior quarter. Credit quality remains strong with net charge-offs of 16 basis points and allowance for credit losses of 1.93%. As Steve mentioned, capital increased from the prior quarter. This solid capital position, coupled with our robust credit reserves, puts our CET1 plus ACL loss-absorbing capacity in the top quartile of the peer group. Turning to Slide 7; average loan balances increased 0.8% quarter-over-quarter or 3.1% annualized, driven by commercial loans which increased by $772 million or 1.1% from the prior quarter. Primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance which increased $464 million; asset Finance increased by $234 million; Business Banking increased by $160 million; Auto floorplan increased by $175 million. Offsetting this growth, CRE balances were lower by $340 million. In Consumer, growth continued to be led by residential mortgage which increased by $438 million; and RV Marine which increased by $112 million. Partially offsetting this growth were lower auto loan balances which declined by $318 million. Turning to Slide 8; as noted, we continued to deliver ending deposit growth in the second quarter. Balances were higher by $2.7 billion, primarily driven by consumer with commercial balances up modestly. On a year-over-year basis, ending deposits increased by $2.6 billion or 1.8%. Turning to Slide 9; we saw sustained growth in deposit balances throughout the second quarter. On a monthly basis, total deposit average balances expanded sequentially for April, May and June, with June 30 ending balances above the June monthly average, providing a strong start point as we enter Q3. Within consumer deposits, we have now seen average balances increase for 7 months in a row. Within Commercial, average monthly deposits were stable over the course of the second quarter. Turning to Slide 10; I want to share more details on our noninterest-bearing deposits. Overall, the $33 billion of these deposits represent 23% of total balances and are well diversified across Consumer, Business and Commercial Banking. The ongoing mix shift we have seen from noninterest-bearing over the past 2 quarters has been in line with our expectations and consistent with what we saw in the last cycle. We expect this mix shift trend to moderate and then stabilize in 2024. This trend is reflected in our total deposit beta guidance. On to Slide 11; for the quarter net interest income decreased by $61 million or 4.3% to $1,357 billion, driven by lower sequential net interest margin. On a year-over-year basis, NII increased $90 million or 7.1%. We continue to benefit significantly from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins that has occurred throughout the cycle. Reconciling the change in NIM from the prior quarter, we saw a reduction of 29 basis points on both a GAAP and core basis excluding accretion. During Q2, we maintained an elevated cash balance relative to Q1 which impacted NIM even as it had a relatively minor actual cash economic cost. On a comparative basis, normalizing for cash levels, NIM was 3.17% for the quarter or a 21 basis point decline from the prior quarter. The biggest drivers of the lower NIM quarter-over-quarter were higher funding costs partially offset by increased earning asset yields. We continue to analyze multiple potential interest rate scenarios as we forecast expected trends over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. The 2 primary scenarios we incorporate include : one which is represented by the forward yield curve and another which assumes rates stay higher for longer and end 2024, approximately 75 basis points higher than the forward. We think this is the most likely range for short-term rates over the next 6 quarters. Based on this range, we anticipate net interest margin of approximately 3% by Q4, plus or minus a few basis points. This would equate to core net interest income on a dollar basis for the fourth quarter to be down approximately 1% to 2% from Q2 levels. As we look out further into 2024, clearly, the trends will depend on both those interest rate scenarios and what is happening with the broader economy and industry factors, including loan demand and deposit growth. That said, our modeling indicates NIM outlooks are stable to rising during 2024 which, coupled with earning asset growth, is expected to drive net interest income dollar expansion as we move through 2024. Turning to Slide 12; cost of deposits moved higher in the quarter to 1.57%. Our cumulative beta through Q2 is 32%, up 7 percentage points from the prior quarter, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. As I mentioned, we continue to expect cumulative deposit beta of approximately 40%. Turning to Slide 13; on the securities portfolio, we saw another step-up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We did not reinvest cash flows from securities in the second quarter as we allowed those proceeds to remain in cash given the attractive short-term rates. Cash and securities balances on average increased by $5 billion from the prior quarter as we maintained higher cash levels in the quarter. As of June 30, on an ending basis, cash and securities totaled $52 billion, representing a more normalized level as we go forward into Q3. Turning to Slide 14; our contingent liquidity continues to be robust. Our 2 primary sources of liquidity, cash and borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve represented $11 billion and $77 billion, respectively, at the end of Q2. At quarter end, this pool of available liquidity represented 205% of total uninsured deposits, a peer-leading coverage. Turning to Slide 15; our hedging program is dynamic, continually optimized and well diversified. Our objectives are to protect capital in uprate scenarios and protect NIM in downrate scenarios. During the quarter, we further expanded our Pay Fix swaptions hedge position to protect capital from tail risk in substantive upgrade scenarios. There is a modest upfront premium associated with these swaptions and the hedges result in a mark-to-market each quarter as they're deemed economic hedges. On the subsequent slide, you will see that positive impact during the second quarter on our fee revenues. We also remain focused on our objective of managing NIM to protect the downside and have maintained additional upside NIM opportunity given our asset sensitivity. The interest rate movements in the first few weeks of Q3 have provided opportunities for additional attractive hedging. We have incrementally added modest additional exposures to both our capital protection and NIM protection hedge portfolios and will remain dynamic as we go throughout the quarter if further opportunities arise. Moving on to Slide 16; non-interest income was $495 million for the second quarter. Excluding notable items, fees increased $40 million, including an $18 million benefit from the positive mark-to-market on the pay fix swaptions. Excluding this benefit, underlying fee income would have been $477 million. We saw solid performance in our key areas of strategic focus, including payments and wealth management. Capital markets revenues declined by $2 million from the prior quarter, however, increased by $3 million year-over-year. Clearly, the events of March and the U.S. debt ceiling debate caused a fairly challenging capital markets environment in Q2. However, pipelines remain solid and there are encouraging signs pointing to opportunity in the back half of the year. Moving on to Slide 17; GAAP noninterest expense decreased by $36 million. Adjusted for notable items in the prior quarter, core expenses increased by $6 million, driven by a full quarter effect of annual merit increases and higher marketing spend. We entered the year with a posture of managing core expense growth to a very low level given the economic backdrop. We developed and executed a series of proactive actions to reduce expense run rates, including the voluntary retirement program, organizational alignment and our continued implementation of long-term efficiency programs such as branch optimization and operation accelerate. We continually calibrate the level of expense growth to revenues and we're taking additional actions to further manage the pace of expense growth, even as we remain focused on self-funding investments in our key growth initiatives. We are actively working on the next set of medium-term efficiency opportunities, including business process outsourcing which represents a promising lever for us to continue to deliver a low level expense growth into 2024. Slide 18 recaps our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 increased to 9.82% and has increased sequentially for 4 quarters. OCI impacts to common equity Tier 1 resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 8.12%. Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, increased 3 basis points to 5.80%. Q2 ending cash levels were higher than Q1 end which impacted the TCE ratio by 2 basis points. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.45%. Our capital management strategy will result in expanding capital over the course of the year while maintaining our top priority to fund high-return loan growth. We intend to grow CET1 to the very high end of our target operating range of 9% to 10%. Adjusting for AOCI, we expect adjusted CET1 to be in the approximately mid-8s range by year-end. On Slide 19, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 16 basis points for the quarter. This was lower than last quarter by 3 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, charge-offs were up 13 basis points from the prior year's historic low level. Nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for 8 consecutive quarters. Allowance for credit losses is higher by 3 basis points to 1.93% of total loans. On Slide 20, we continue to be below our target range of net charge-offs through the cycle of 25 to 45 basis points and our ACL coverage ratio is among the highest in our peer group. Let's turn to our 2023 outlook on Slide 21. As I noted, we analyzed multiple potential scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans. Our guidance is informed by the interest rate scenarios I discussed previously and the consensus economic outlook. On loans, our outlook is 5% to 6%, consistent with our prior expectations to be near the lower end of our prior range. On deposits, we maintain our outlook of 1% to 3% growth for the full year. Core net interest income ex PAA and PPP is expected to grow between 3% and 5%, inclusive of our expectations for deposit beta and loan growth. Non-interest income on a core full year basis is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This range reflects the results from capital markets we've already seen in Q2 and the assumption of gradual improvement in activities throughout the balance of the year. The remainder of our fee businesses are tracking very well to our prior expectations. On expenses, as noted, we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a very low level and calibrated to revenue growth. For the full year, we expect core underlying expense growth between 1% and 2%, plus the incremental expenses from the full year run rate of Capstone and Torana of approximately $50 million and the 2 basis point increase in 2023 FDIC insurance rates of approximately $30 million. And finally, given the strong results posted during the first half of the year, we now expect full year net charge-offs to be between 20 to 30 basis points. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Manan Gosalia : I wanted to dig into your comments on NIM being stable to rising in 2024 under the 2 scenarios that you outlined for it. Can you expand on some of the moving parts in there, especially in the higher for longer scenario? I guess, would that put more pressure on NII than the forward curve scenario with higher deposit betas? Or do I have that wrong? Zach Wasserman : Manan, this is Zach. I'll take that one and thanks for the question. I think the outlook that we're seeing is really consistent with both of those scenarios. So I think -- in the higher per longer scenario that's sort of the top end of that general range, would benefit from asset sensitivity, asset yields would continue to rise, likely there would be a continuation in kind of an extending [indiscernible] the liability pricing cycle. But none of those 2 things, we continue to expect to actually be higher overall NIM, given the asset sensitivity and very consistent with what we've discussed over time. At the lower end of the scenario, you see the kind of the faster [indiscernible] deposit pricing cycle but also some less increase in asset pricing and we [indiscernible]; for the NIM but albeit maybe a few basis points lower than that. So generally, higher rates for us continue to corroborate to hire them. I would note as well that during the course of 2024, we will benefit from the shifting from a negative carry on our downrate hedging program to much more neutral position by the end of the year. So that will be a support for NIM trajectory throughout the course of '24. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then separately, just on regulation overall, I know you noted that the new requirements seem to broadly coming in, in line with expectations. But maybe if you can dig into how you're managing ahead of that. I know you're keeping you're building capital levels from here. You're holding a high level of cash instead of reinvesting in securities. So maybe can you expand on where you expect regulation to go, especially as it relates to the AOCI opt-out as well as LCR. Zach Wasserman : Sure. As you know, we are trying to be planful anticipatory of where we think things are going and manage it headed. And I think at the most macro level, we do think we'll be able to relatively expediently address these potential new regulations. And frankly, over time, offset a lot of what otherwise the potential impact on them. But digging in specifically, it's our working assumption that the tailoring exclusion of AOCI, not [indiscernible] will likely be removed. And hence, it's our plan to see to manage capital hire to CET1 inclusive of AOCI higher in the guidance we indicated in the mid-8s range by the end of 2023. And if we continue on with the same operating posture to 2024, we would expect that ratio to approach 9% essentially get to 9% by the end of 2024; so back to essentially the low end of our operating range on that basis. We're also actively looking at the Basel III potential new RWA changes. As you know well, there are 3 big changes in there. The fundamental review of the trading book, we think that's going to essentially material for Huntington given our business mix. There's operational risk requirements which likely will be increasing RWA, they're largely key-off of fee income. We see a slightly higher aridity from that. However, offsetting that, will be credit risk RWAs which are more new ones, more fine-tuned and on-net are lower, we believe, for Huntington. Still early days and we have more analysis to go away. We see offsetting factors there unclear whether there will be a net impact from that but generally relatively offsetting. As it relates to other regulatory focuses like liquidity like potential long-term debt. Likewise, we're monitoring and we think we can -- those impacts will be relatively small over time. Happy to double click on that and any further questions for folks want. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: We're seeing from some of your peers is a pullback in lending as they look to build capital and alleviate some funding pressure. On the flip side, obviously, you've got very strong capital, strong liquidity as you highlighted, high reserves. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about how you can play offset and maybe to even pull back by some of your peers? Zach Wasserman : It's a great question, Matt and it's something that we really have to look at because we are in a position of strength. We want to really seize the opportunities to win new clients in a great business. It's in times like this that companies when they operate [indiscernible] can being meaningfully during market share and we're cognizant of that. We're balancing that clearly with 2 factors : One, the desire to not only grow loans but to also drive capital or as I just noted in the prior question. So we're actively modulating loan growth, bringing it down from a 10% run rate year-over-year level to 5% in Q1, 3% in Q2. I think will be more like 1% probably the back half of the year. We're also very much looking at how we can potentially optimize the balance sheet and drive higher returns out of the assets that we do have. With that being said, we are on our front foot. You saw us hire the fund for the EMS team which will be a great new business line for us, brings liquidity, great customer quality there. And we are continuing to look finding pockets of strong growth, even as we optimize for the highest returns for the year at the margin. So very much on the front book. And to your point, there are back opportunities that we'll see some [indiscernible]. Matt O'Connor: And then, I guess just following up on the lending side. I mean everything we can track, it seems like auto spreads are at or near highs [indiscernible] commercial spread of widen. So why isn't there a leaning into this? Or is it just that the demand is not there at this point? Zach Wasserman : Look, I think there are continues to be pockets of demand and great clients. And we've got a very strong set of workforce supporting as well. And to your point, the yields are strong. With that being said, clearly, the deposit costs are also rising and funding costs are also rising. So we're balancing those things in the way we think is prudent. Driving higher yields, I would say, really feel encouraged by what we're seeing on the asset yield side. The long-durated asset categories like mortgage and auto really benefiting between 10 bps and 20 bps on the portfolio. And I expect that to continue for some time to come really sustaining that 2024 beyond NIM that we were talking about in the previous question, even as again, we optimize to also allow capital to us. Steve Steinour : Matt, this is Steve. I think it's fair to say we're being a little cautious until we know the outcome of the regulatory suggested reforms as well. There's more opportunity. I think that we will avail ourselves once we know what the rules are and the positions that we need to have going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Steven Alexopoulos : I want to -- so at the commentary you gave about the NIM getting down to about 3% by the fourth quarter is helpful. I'd imagine once we move beyond that, because it sounds like most of the mix shift out of noninterest-bearing will be done, it's really going to be that incremental NIM that's going to decide where we go from there. What is the spot NIM today, right, incremental loans, incremental deposits? Just how does that compare to that 3% level? Zach Wasserman : It's still higher than that. I think, again, I'd point you to for the quarter adjusted for cash levels that we're kind of running at now in the third quarter, the second quarter was around 3.17%. And so what we're seeing at the margin is continued modest decline in them here through the course of the balance of this year from that 3.17% normalized Q2 run rate down to the 3% by the end of the year. And I agree with your point which is as you get into the early part of next year, a lot of the kind of major trends starting to stabilize and it's really not incremental fundamental what the underlying is. Likely, there will be some potential continued trends in the very early part of '24 but I agree with your point. I would also note that for us during the quarter, the reduction in the negative carrier from hedges will incrementally help obviously do the course of the year again. Steven Alexopoulos : Right for some tailwinds there, okay. And then for Steve, so the equity market seems to be coming around to this possibility of the soft landing. I'm curious, when you talk to your customers, what are you hearing? Are they coming around to the soft landing and maybe a little more optimistic what are you hearing. Steve Steinour : Steve, I would say our customers generally are having a good year and expect to close out with the good year. They're working their margins through expenses but inflation seems to be a big and the supply chain is in better shape. Clearer line sites to this half and they're optimistic about '24 and beyond generally. So this would suggest at worst-case soft landing and potentially the ability to avoid a recession. In the Midwest, particularly our footprint, we still have a lot of economic activity, announcements of investments, targeted growth. So we're in a good position relative to some of the other regions and we have significant activity going on that I think we'll see particularly here in Ohio through the course of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just wanted to go -- spend some time on the expense outlook. I think you've done a lot of work year-to-date, the project actual rate that you talk about. In fact, I think you said the goal is to keep expense growth low for next year. Maybe give us a sense of the size of the BPO opportunity that you talked about? And how do you think about positive operating leverage going into next year given NII growth will likely be down. What's around that? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question, Ebrahim. Thanks. So maybe framing the overall [indiscernible] is very much to keep operating expenses at a very low level, not only this year but next year. We've been trying to be very proactive and setting up those programs and can implement them effectively and have to build over time. On the BPO opportunity, this is something that we have leveraged over time for a while and continually looking at from a strategic perspective, what functions that we really believe must be owned or the critical value for the real by Huntington versus those that we can benefit from the scale capabilities of partnering [ph]. The more we need in to analyze that, the more we're encouraged there are incremental opportunities. Relatively modest in terms of size this year but building over time. And I think really part of the portfolio of efficiency programs that will support that low level of '24 and frankly, to continue to build into '25 and beyond also. So it's encouraging to get part of the portfolio of programs with something that we're incrementally leading in now to be able to accelerate the benefits of. On positive operating leverage, as we've said a lot, it's a core tenet of our operating plans, one of the 3 major financial targets we set for ourselves, it's something we take very seriously. Of course, we're managing the company for the medium term to really generate value and want to make sure that we're not doing anything in the short term that we've damaged that long-term growth trajectory. Too early to say what '24 will look like. I think you'll clearly have a grow over on revenue that will pressure revenue growth but we're also very encouraged with the opportunity to keep expense growth low. So not going to give guidance at this moment. I still think it's within the major reason that we're going to drive order. Steve Steinour : Ebrahim, if I could add, this is Steve. The team is also working on a longer-term project operation accelerate. We shared that at the Investor Day. It's changing procedures and digitizing substantially the front to back side of the bank, that is going very well. It's on track. It was multiyear and that will help us with both efficiencies and customer set. So we've Zach has got us focused on consolidated 3 branches. We did a voluntary retirement program. We've done some restructuring and segments and some of the business units and support units during the course of the year. What he's referencing now with BPL is additive to a very healthy level of focus and activity on the expense management side so far this year. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And any updated thoughts? Steve, you talked about building capital but at the same time, you've talked about fee revenue opportunities, doing some targeted M&A like you've done in the past. Any thoughts there? Is the opportunity set attractive for you to do anything? Steve Steinour : Well, our focus, as you know, is always to grow the core of the business. We've got a lot of opportunity to do that in front of us. And as the regulatory expectations around capital and liquidity, et cetera, get established, I think we're going to be in a very strong position to [indiscernible] that in an even more robust fashion. We're trying to get positioned for that now. the outlet, as you saw last year, there are a few businesses that were attractive. I suspect we'll find some additional ones at some point in the future. But we believe we've got a lot of opportunity at hand. There's nothing pressing in terms of pushing or needing to push for M&A now. And so we're very, very focused on driving the core. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Steve or Zach, kind of conceptually, maybe when you think about the 40% cumm-beta [ph], maybe just a thought or two on the major puts and takes when you think about that being the right number for you all. You guys are in a very competitive market but I think it's clear within like the last month or so, especially that the deposit flows are there. So, I guess I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamics? What sort of makes that the right number to land on it? Zach Wasserman : This is Zach, I'll take that one. We -- all of the trends and forecasts that we're creating and as I noted in the prepared remarks, pretty rigorous multiple scenarios underlying that continue to corroborate that. So we feel like it's a good forecast. As always -- I always know the best forecast we've got, we'll share an update on if ever that pass. But our focus has been pretty stable around that level for a while now and the kind of underlying monthly trends continue to cooperate. But just double-clicking into the drivers, I would say, one, we're seeing continued modest rise in deposit costs but at a decelerating rate just like you would expect it to be -- we saw a beta trend by 8% in Q1, 7% in Q2. It will be less than that we go to Q3, clearly and then kind of topping out into Q4. So that's why we're just sort of seeing a declining trend all be increasing. The other thing is the mix shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing is occurring fairly well like we would expect it to in the cycle and that lifeline is decelerating. And most of that mix shift has happened at this point. And we're already going to see the signs of that again kind of buildup and corroborate to that 40%. On the competition side, it's a competitive environment. But to your point, the deposits are there. And I think it's what's encouraging is it's very rational. And I think that given decelerating loan growth throughout the industry and for us, that's the kind of escape valve and pressure which is allowing us to manage pretty well here according to our plan. So overall, still in the right forecast. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is actually a clarification one, your 40% to the data, the unfold deposits, correct? Zach Wasserman : That's correct. Erika Najarian : Yes. Because a lot of your peers gave it on interest-bearing. So I just wanted to make sure that just touted that one, Scott was asking that question. And my real question is, I think the market really close sort of the expansion of the net interest income outlook. Could you tell us about how you're thinking about the elasticity of deposit license on the way down? I think to your point earlier, Zach, there are a lot of investors that are thinking about where you cut for next year. And they're wondering how much power do banks have price down if rates stay at a relatively high level versus what we've seen in a while? Zach Wasserman : Yes, terrific questions. Also in soft topics, it's got lots of mind share just as vigorously as we anticipated on the way up on the just as our growth on the way down. So very much planning watching. I think it will clearly be a function of what segments you're in, what segment you're looking at. On the commercial side, where betas are generally higher and stone bespoke and prior agreement between us and our clients on how we'll trend that will likewise trend low. I think we're pretty confident will drive that as a very similar measure to the way it went up. I think -- many of the other very rational price segments like that in the middle market and business banking will likewise trend down pretty fast as rates decline. Again, in some of the categories in which we've been growing in consumer, there are some time dimensions to them which we'll have to manage at those times to lapse. But again, the playbook there is well trod and I think you feel quite good about the ability to bring that down. The overall last on the consumer side will clearly be a function of what's going on in the economy at that point and the outlook for a forward at that point but of the playbooks in history would tend to grow our ability to do that pretty well. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just as a follow-up to that, if I may. You're holding a lot of cash. And obviously, there's not a lot of motivation to deploy that. Again, as we think about next year in the same scenario, you're still going to be earning a lot of your cash on your cash flow 0% risk weight if the Fed moderately. And I guess outside of better loan growth, Zach, what would be the factors for you to normalize, start normalizing that cash to a level that's more appropriate? Or do you feel like with all the liquidity rolls down the pipe, you might as well just hold it there for now since you're getting paid for it anyway? Zach Wasserman : Yes. I think that the level that we're running at for cash right now is sort of around $8 billion to $9 billion is the right level for the company given the liquidity requirements. So I think we're generally at where we think is the right level. Always tuning at the margin for how we're incrementally funding and kind of tuning the short-term FHLB borrowings at the cash level. But I think for the most part, that cash level is right sized right now. I think within the securities portfolio broadly, we'll continue to see the trend of moderately lower duration sequentially as we've been doing, frankly, the last 3 quarters in a row; and just continuing to preference liquidity. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Is that just a follow-up on your NII '24 comments. And if you talked about earning asset growth. I'm just wondering if your balance sheet has been elevated this quarter a good amount. And I guess are you expecting as you look out further that deposit growth will continue to carry the overall balance sheet side forward? And kind of, I guess, how do you think about the wholesale funding part of the equation as a balancing act on that? Zach Wasserman : Yes, terrific question. Broadly speaking, the answer is yes. So I believe that we will rate loan growth in line with deposit growth for the most parts. And I think that's what we'll see here in the back half of this year. That's my expectation what the trend is to 2024 as well. I tend to see a pretty stable but slightly lower the loan-to-deposit ratio here over the next couple of quarters. And just fundamentally match funding making sure we can one of those fundamental underlying factors that allows us to manage the deposit beta and the marginal margin that we're getting up on the loan as I noted earlier. So it's an important dynamic. The good thing and I think we've talked about this in the past, is that we are coming to this cycle and we're now operating, let's say, in 3 quarters of the innings and a pretty favorable position where we saw really attractive loan opportunities, we could, in fact, fund them with noncustomer sources of funding and increase loan-to-deposit ratio but as not the default position for now. I think we're now, I think, getting loans and deposits growing at a pretty similar rate. It's quite healthy and a good balance for us. Ken Usdin : Okay. And a follow-up, can you try to help us understand how the benefits from the security swaps look this quarter? And then as you go forward into next year, just your loan hedges, does that become a part of the benefit next year in terms of getting that NII starting to move the right way? Zach Wasserman : Yes, it does. Great question, Ken. Let me elaborate on that. So up through the only part of Q3, inclusive of activities we've done in the first few weeks of this quarter, we've got around $29 billion of downgrade hedge protection through -- received fixed swaps it's around $21 billion, $22 billion. We've got some floor spreads which pay off under downgrade scenarios and then a portfolio of collars which will the option to enter into received fixed swaps in the future. And likely will, if rates continue to trend generally what they're expected to. So it's a pretty powerful portfolio that both extent now and even more than will be extent over the coming 6 to 12 months as we enter into those color-based RSG fixed loss. The impact, obviously, I mean, the challenge in hedging right now is that with an inverted yield curve and by me, with a fairly steep decline already forecasted, you've got some pretty dire downgrade scenarios to convince yourself that makes sense to incrementally entree things right now, given that they carry right now. What we are experiencing in the P&L at this moment is about 15 basis points of negative NIM drag from the receipt fix that we're already in. And that will go into essentially 0 by the end of 2024, if you follow out the forward yield curve scenarios. So that's 15 basis points of tailwind which we should see between now and the end of '24, fairly ratable clawback throughout that period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom : A couple of credit questions. First of all, congratulations -- congratulations, Rich, on your retirement. Done a great job and I've enjoyed your perspective on these calls. Commercial real estate and consumer question. So on commercial real estate, how far ahead can you guys look in terms of identifying future issues? I know it's been a focus for you guys to tighten things up. But curious what you're doing now and it obviously looks very clean but you have a fair amount of reserves allocated to the business and that's kind of why I ask. Rich Pohle : Yes. We're looking -- we're focused primarily right now on the 2023 and 2024 impacts. And it's really hard to look much further beyond that. So we're doing quarterly portfolio reviews in office. We're touching the real estate book every month. I think we've probably gone through 90% of the loans over $5 million in that book at this point. But the focus is on '23 and '24 and managing what we can control and that really relates to the maturities. And then particularly with respect to office, the lease rollovers that might be impacting cash flow in this year and next. So that's the primary focus. Beyond that, it's tough. You mentioned the 9% reserve. We've got against softness. We've got a 3.4% reserve against overall prebook. We feel for what we know right now, both of those are adequate and we'll continue to look at those on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Steve Steinour : Jon, Rich is also with the team getting long rebalanced wherever there appear to be issues that are proactive efforts to try to get those addressed paydowns [indiscernible]; almost of the efforts -- the primary focus is '23 '24. But there's also a long view full view of the portfolio over the next decade and other related issues, all of which are -- we're actively managing. We've been doing that for over a year and trying to stay well ahead of any issues may occur at this point to put in really good shape. Jon Arfstrom : It seems that way. Okay. And then on consumer, I look at this every quarter, just your nonaccruals and charge-offs and it's just kind of -- it's nothing really. Maybe it goes to the soft landing comments but you look at RV marine consumer categories, delinquencies really haven't budged. Are you seeing anything in consumer health that bothers you at all because it's just -- these numbers are really, really good. Rich Pohle : No, the numbers are really good. And I think it goes to the client selection and just the focus that we've got on prime and super prime. If you look across the entire consumer spectrum. There's really nothing in there that would lead you to believe that we're going to have anything more than just a gradual return what might be more normalized levels of charge-offs. Because right now, to your point, they're running extremely low. The only area that I would point out that's a little bit relatively higher stress than the rest of the book is and that's because of the floating rate nature of that portfolio. So it's going to lead to a little higher level of delinquencies than you might see across the book but the analysis that we've done from a vintage standpoint, on that book show that we're in the 55% to 60% loan-to-value range. So even though we might see higher levels of delinquency. We don't think the losses will follow. Steve Steinour : Housing markets are generally tight where we are, John. So if someone has -- and unemployment is very low. So if someone has an issue, the best resolution is to sell a property, unlike what we might have seen in '08, '09 or prior [indiscernible]. Just to give Rich a little credit here and recognition. We've been at an effort to outperform our peers for over a decade with this aggregate moderate to low risk profile and he's been very, very disciplined about that. And we expect to outperform through the cycle. We've been sharing that all along. At this point, really, really good in that regard and a tribute to all my comments especially Rich and his leadership. Jon Arfstrom : Yes, I agree. Steve, I was thinking you could give them a fishing boat or an RV out of the foreclosure pull there's anything to give. Steve Steinour : We just don't have any other assets. On my lunch at some at posters. We pull those out. Jon Arfstrom : Just to clean up for you, Zach. The $60 million to $50 million on the Capstone, Torana. What drove that? I know it's small $10 million but what happened there? Zach Wasserman : Yes. And Julie, that's reflective of -- the cost that we see in that previous $60 million was mainly Capstone and has a factor of production and revenues that flow through into compensation expense. And so when capital markets revenues were a bit softer in the second quarter, our outlook somewhat lower than was originally budgeted into the back half of the year, so proud which is less flow through into less cost. That's basically it. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. And then the $30 million FDIC, that's all in the third quarter. Is that correct? Zach Wasserman : So let me clarify that it's really important one. That FDIC expense that we talked about in that guidance is the 2 basis points higher assessment that is being assessed across the industry and that was known late last year and it's coming through every quarter. It's not the special assessment that's still being discussed. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Steinour for any final comments. Steve Steinour : Well, thank you very much for joining us today. We're very pleased with the second quarter results as we dynamically manage through this unique environment. As you heard, we're very well positioned for times such as these with strong credit quality, improving capital ratios and robust liquidity. The deposit, both in particular in strangler nature has served us very, very well as head of our efforts to provide customer service and generate great satisfaction over the years. And we have a team of disciplined operators and we are executing our strategy that we outlined last year at our Investor Day which provides are driving value for our shareholders. And just as a reminder, the Board of Executives and our colleagues were all top 10 shareholders collectively. So that reflects a strong alignment with our shareholders and I think you're seeing the benefits of that through our results. So thank you for your support and interest in Huntington and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and a replay will be available starting about 1 hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, and Brendan Lawlor, Deputy Chief Credit Officer will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our third quarter results, which Zach will detail later. Our approach to both our colleagues and customers continues to be grounded in our purpose. Our colleagues, again, demonstrated that we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. Now on to Slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, Huntington is extraordinarily well positioned to manage through the evolving landscape for banks. The near-term environment includes higher for longer interest rates and uncertain economic outlook, expected new capital regulations, as well as heightened regulatory requirements. Huntington operates in this dynamic period from a position of substantial strength. Our balance sheet and risk profile were intentionally built over more than a decade, explicitly for these times. Our market position, digital leadership, and momentum in core growth strategies put us in the top of the peer set. We intend to lean into this position of strength to drive incremental growth through existing and new capabilities. Second, we've managed top quartile CET1 inclusive of AOCI. We will continue to drive additional capital expansion for the remainder of this year and over the course of 2024. Third, we benefit from a cultivated, granular deposit franchise and have delivered consistent core deposit growth. Our balanced deposit base forms the foundation of our robust liquidity framework and has been a driving factor in our well-managed beta over the rate cycle today. Fourth, credit quality remains strong across our portfolios, driven by our disciplined customer selection, underwriting, and rigorous portfolio management. This approach is unwavering, starting with our tone at the top as we maintain our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Finally, we remain intently focused on our core strategy. We are executing with discipline, while expanding with existing and new capabilities to support our long-term growth. And very importantly, we are remaining steadfast in our commitment to drive operating efficiency over time with continued execution of proactive expense management programs. We expect a level of uncertainty in the near term and some level of higher expenses to manage through the realities of the current operating environment. However, these investments will also be accompanied by sustained revenue growth, and the net result will be a Huntington that continues to be a strong regional bank with significant growth opportunities ahead. I will move us on to Slide 5 to further illustrate our position of strength. Our adjusted CET1 ratio is strong and near the top of the peer group. We intend to drive this ratio higher throughout this year and 2024. This plan extends our position of strength, supports continued execution of core growth strategies, and puts us well ahead of the proposed Basel III endgame and other requirements. Deposit growth has also outperformed our peers by nearly 10 percentage points since the end of 2021. We've built one of the most granular deposit bases with a leading insured deposit percentage, and we continue to drive the expansion of primary bank customer relationships. Our liquidity is best-in-class for coverage of uninsured deposits, representing nearly twice the level of peers, and we already meet the liquidity coverage ratio on an unmodified basis. Credit metrics are also a differentiator for Huntington. With top quartile and charge-offs compared to peers, and our credit reserves are top tier. Our management team has a long track record of disciplined execution. For example, we were recently named the number one SBA lender nationally for the sixth consecutive year and we continue to expand the reach of this business and our support of access to capital for small businesses. Interest rates continue on a path towards the higher for longer scenario which we've been anticipating for some time. As rates remain higher, the potential for economic activity to be negatively impacted has increased. However, thus far in the cycle, overall, our customers are effectively managing through it. We remain highly vigilant in our proactively managing all loan portfolios. Our top-tier credit reserves and expanding capital support our approach to be front-footed to take advantage of opportunities to win new customers and grow our businesses. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our third quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.35 and adjusted EPS of $0.36. The quarter included $15 million of notable items, which impacted EPS by $0.01 per common share. Return on Tangible Common Equity, or ROTCE, came in at 19.5% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 20%. Further adjusting for AOCI, underlying ROTCE was 15.3%. Average deposits grew during the quarter, increasing by $2.6 billion or 1.8%. Loan balances decreased by $561 million or one-half of 1% from Q2, driven both by seasonality and our continued optimization. Net interest income on a dollar basis expanded quarter-over-quarter, driven by a rising net interest margin. We continue to proactively manage expenses and have begun a new set of incremental actions in the third quarter, including branch consolidation, staffing efficiencies, and corporate real estate consolidations. These actions, coupled with our ongoing long-term efficiency programs, as well as the measures we implemented in Q1 of this year, will help us drive rigorous baseline expense efficiency, while sustaining capacity for investments in the franchise. Credit quality remains strong, with net charge-offs of 24 basis points and allowance for credit losses of 1.96%. Return on capital was robust, driving capital accretion with reported CET1 now above 10%. Turning to Slide 7. As I noted, average loan balances decreased one-half of 1% from Q2, driven primarily by lower commercial loan balances, which decreased by $1.2 billion, or 1.7% from the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, average loans increased 3.3%, reflective of our intentional optimization efforts. Primary components of the commercial loan change included CRE balances, which declined by $387 million, driven by paydowns. Distribution finance decreased $434 million due to normal seasonality with lower dealer inventory levels in the third quarter before the expected inventory build in the fourth quarter. Asset finance decreased by $271 million. Auto floorplan increased by $122 million, all other commercial categories net decreased as we continued to drive optimization towards the highest returns. In consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage and RV marine, while auto loan balances declined for the quarter. Turning to Slide 8. As noted, we continued to deliver consistent deposit growth in the quarter. Average deposits increased by $2.6 billion or 1.8% from the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9, we saw sustained growth in deposit balances in the third quarter, including sequential increases during July, August, and September, continuing the trend we have seen previously. Importantly, core deposits represented the entirety of the deposit growth for the quarter, with broker deposits declining quarter-over-quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Non-interest-bearing mix shift continues to track closely to our forecast with the deceleration of sequential changes that we would expect at this point in the rate cycle. The non-interest-bearing percentage decreased by 120 basis points from the second quarter, and we continue to expect this mix shift to moderate and stabilize during 2024. On to Slide 11. For the quarter, net interest income increased by $22 million, or 1.6% to $1.379 billion, driven by expanded net interest margin. We continued to benefit from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins that has occurred throughout this cycle, with net interest income growing at 9% CAGR over the past two years. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q2, we saw an increase of 9 basis points on a GAAP basis and an increase of 10 basis points on a core basis, excluding accretion. The drivers of the higher NIM quarter-over-quarter were higher spread, net of free funds, lower Fed cash balances versus the prior quarter, and higher FHLB stock dividends in the quarter. Interest rates rose during the quarter, particularly at the longer end, and as we expected, that drove a net benefit to NIM. In addition, our optimization efforts across both loan growth and funding mix continue to perform very well. These factors resulted in the margin coming in better than we had expected when we shared our outlook in July. We continue to analyze multiple potential interest rate scenarios. The basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the low end by the forward yield curve and at the high end by a scenario that projects rates stay higher for longer. The higher for longer scenario today assumes one additional rate increase in 2023, flat Fed funds through October of 2024, and ends 2024 approximately 75 basis points higher than the forward curve. With the move and rates higher, we now anticipate net interest margin for the fourth quarter to be around 305 basis points to 310 basis points. This is 5 basis points to 10 basis points higher than the level we shared previously. Looking further out, our modeling continues to indicate 2024 NIM trending flat to higher from the Q4 2023 endpoint. Turning to Slide 12. Our cumulative deposit beta through Q3 was 37%, up 5 percentage points from the prior quarter, tracking closely to our expectations. Sequential increases in beta are slowing quarter-over-quarter as we have forecasted as the interest rate cycle nears or hits its peak. As we have noted in the past, where beta ultimately tops out will be a function of the endgame for the rate cycle, in terms of the level and timing of the peak, the duration of any extended pause before a decrease. Given the outlooks for possibly a higher peak and very likely a more extended pause than was the case three months ago, our current outlook for deposit beta is to trend a few percentage points higher than our prior guidance of 40%. We will have to see how the rate environment plays out to 2024 to know with certainty. What is critical in our view is to ensure we continue to manage both deposit and loan pricing exceptionally rigorously; drive asset yields higher; deliver solid incremental returns; and deliver a better overall NIM from the higher for longer rate environment as a result. Turning to Slide 13 and expanding on my point on loan yields. The construct of our balance sheet is approximately half fully variable rate, 10% indirect auto, which is a shorter, approximately two-year duration fixed product, 10% in arms with a five-year duration, and the remainder of approximately 30% is longer-durated fixed. This mix contributes to the asset sensitivity of our overall balance sheet and has helped us to benefit significantly from the current rate cycle. We are seeing solid increases in fixed asset portfolio yields. Given the higher for longer rate environment, we expect to continue to benefit from this fixed asset repricing going forward, supporting the higher NIM outlook. Turning to Slide 14, our level of cash and securities was down slightly from the prior quarter as we lowered some of the elevated cash we've been holding in Q2. During Q3, we did not reinvest securities cash flows, and the securities balance moved modestly lower as proceeds were held in cash given the attractive short-term rates. We're managing the duration of the portfolio lower, continuing our management approach since 2021. Turning to Slide 15, our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at $91 billion and has grown quarter-over-quarter. At quarter end, this pool of available liquidity represented 204% of total uninsured deposits appear leading coverage. Turning to Slide 16, we continued to be dynamic in adding to our hedging program during the quarter. Our objectives remain twofold, to protect capital in up-rate scenarios and to protect NIM in down-rate scenarios. The most substantive increase was in addition to our forward-starting pay-fix swaption strategy, which increased by $5.9 billion during the quarter to $15.5 billion total. This program is intended to protect capital from tail risk in substantive up-rate scenarios and once again benefited us as rates moved higher in the quarter. We also added $2 billion in [callers] (ph) to support our NIM against longer term down-rate scenarios. Moving on to Slide 17. GAAP non-interest income increased by $14 million, or 2.8%, to $509 million for the third quarter. Excluding the mark to market on the pay-fix swaptions, fees were relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. On an underlying basis compared to the second quarter, we saw increases in deposit service charges, including higher payment-related treasury management fees. This growth was largely offset by lower capital markets fees. Moving on to Slide 18, we're seeing encouraging and sustained underlying trends across our three areas of strategic focus for fee revenue growth. Capital markets, which has grown by a 19% CAGR over the past six years, benefits from a broad set of capabilities bolstered by Capstone. While 2023 has certainly been a challenging environment for capital markets activities, in both advisory and several credit-driven products, forward pipelines within advisory are solid, and we continue to foresee this as a primary contributor to fee revenue growth over the moderate term. Our payments businesses represent one of the biggest opportunities for both relationship deepening and revenue growth across both treasury management and card categories. In wealth management, we see a great opportunity to increase the penetration of the offering across our customers, leveraging our number one ranking for trust as we grow advisory relationships and drive higher managed assets with recurring revenue streams. Moving on to Slide 19, on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense increased by $40 million and underlying core expenses increased by $25 million. As I mentioned, we incurred $15 million of notable item expenses related to the staffing efficiency program and corporate real estate consolidations. Excluding these items, core expense growth compared to the prior quarter was driven by higher personnel, occupancy, professional services, and a set of smaller items within all other expenses. We have taken proactive actions throughout the year to support the low level of core underlying expense growth we have delivered. In the first half of the year, we executed on the voluntary retirement program, organizational realignment, moving from four revenue segments to two, and 31 branch consolidations. Now in the third quarter, we're taking another set of incremental actions. We are accelerating the implementation of our business process offshoring program, and we're creating efficiencies throughout the organization with the goal of prioritizing resources toward the largest growth opportunities in the near term. We're also driving incremental saves in our corporate real estate footprint, as well as implementing another set of branch consolidations with 34 planned closures early next year. These actions demonstrate our commitment to disciplined expense management and will support the continued investment into critical areas of the company to drive long-term value. As we manage expenses, we're balancing both short-term investment and revenue growth with the longer-term opportunities we know are in front of us. Slide 20 recaps our capital position. Reported common equity Tier 1 increased to 10.1% and has increased sequentially for four quarters. OCI impacts to common equity Tier 1 resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 8%. Our capital management strategy will result in expanding capital, while maintaining our top priority to fund high-return loan growth. We're actively managing adjusted CET1, inclusive of AOCI, and expect to drive that ratio higher over the course of 2024. On Slide 21, credit quality continues to perform very well, with normalization of metrics consistent with our expectations. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 24 basis points for the quarter, and while higher than last quarter by 8 basis points, are tracking to our guidance for full-year net charge-offs between 20 basis points and 30 basis points. This level continues to be at the low end of our target through the cycle range for net charge-offs of 25 basis points to 45 basis points. As previously guided, given ongoing normalization, non-performing assets increased from the previous quarter and the criticized asset ratio increased, with risk rating changes within commercial real estate being the largest component. Allowance for credit losses is higher by 3 basis points to 1.96% of total loans, and our ACL coverage ratio is amongst the highest in our peer group. Let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 22. We forecast loan growth of approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, which would put full-year loan growth at approximately 5%, matching the lower end of our prior range. Deposits are likewise expected to grow in the fourth quarter by approximately 1%. Core net interest income for the fourth quarter is expected to decline between 4% and 5% from Q3 before expanding throughout 2024 from that level. Non-interest income on a core underlying basis is expected to be relatively stable. Expenses are expected to increase between 4% and 5% into the fourth quarter, primarily driven by revenue-related expenses associated with the expected growth in capital markets, a seasonal increase in medical claims, and sustained investment in new and enhanced capabilities. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near the midpoint of the 20 basis points to 30 basis points guidance range. Finally, let me close on slide 23 with a few thoughts on our management priorities for 2024. We're still finalizing our budget for next year, and as always, we look to share more specific guidance during our January earnings call. First and foremost, we're committed to driving continued capital expansion, while we continue to optimize lending growth to drive the highest returns. As Steve mentioned, we're playing from a position of strength, and we expect to maintain that position as we get ahead of proposed capital regulations and phase-in periods. Related to deposits, we are continuing to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships. This should result in continued growth of deposits into next year, while supporting our discipline management of deposit beta. Given the expected higher for longer rate scenario, we will continue to position the balance sheet to remain modestly asset sensitive, which will support the margin, and we expect will deliver growth and then interest income dollars on a full year basis. Non-interest income remains a critical focus for us, with sustained execution on three primary strategic areas for fee revenue growth : capital markets, payments, and wealth management. Over the medium term, we expect that noninterest income has the potential to grow at a rate more quickly than both loans and spread revenues, given the opportunities for these fee businesses. As I mentioned on expenses, we have taken considerable actions to hold baseline expense growth to a low level. This focused on sustained efficiencies, including operation accelerate, business process offshoring, and the other actions, will yield multi-year benefits. These actions are necessary to allow for the continued investment into new and enhanced capabilities which will set up growth over the course of the next few years. We expect the net result of these actions for 2024 will be an underlying growth rate of core expenses somewhat higher than the level we saw in 2023. Our current working estimate is underlying expense growth of approximately 4% compared to the approximately 2.5% level we were running in 2023. We believe this level of expense management is the right balance to position the company to operate within the current environment and sustain our momentum into 2025. We will also maintain our rigorous approach to credit management, consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Finally, to close, we believe we are exceptionally well positioned to proactively stay ahead of the evolving environment. We will be dynamic and address these numerous topics head-on. And over time, we believe this will result in opportunities to benefit substantially in the coming years. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Manan. Manan Gosalia : Can you talk about the puts and takes in that 4% expense growth number for next year? What sort of revenue environment is that baken? What are the areas that are pushing up expenses? And maybe also, why you have flexibility to manage more if the revenue environment is weaker? Zach Wasserman : Yep, great question. And this is Zach. I'll take that one. Just to preface it and set a framework for the answer, let me reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks a minute ago, which is driving efficiency in our core expenses is a key priority for us. We're one of the most efficient banks in the regional banking space, and that's been a product of years of efforts. What we're trying to do right now is strike a balance of the short term and the medium term. In the short term, managing expenses to level up with growth given the overall revenue environment. But also in the medium term, we see significant growth opportunities over time for Huntington. And we want to make sure that we can maintain the momentum in our key strategies. And, in fact, capture the higher revenue outlook that we just shared. Even as we quickly get ahead, and I stress that word quickly, get ahead of the new and expanded risk management capabilities that we'll need to operate. If you take a step back, it was just over a year ago that we were fully delivering over $0.5 billion of annual expense saves from the TCF merger. Over the last year since then, we've felt underlying core expenses to 2.4%. And we did that with all the programs I've just talked about in prepared remarks. The long-term efficiency programs, proactive actions we took in the first quarter of this year, and now a new set of actions that we're implementing in the third quarter, including another tranche of branch optimization, accelerating the business process offshoring, driving efficiencies across the bank, and finding efficiencies in our corporate real estate portfolio. And as we look at the 2024, to your question, we're seeing the opportunity for incremental revenue upside, particularly in the really strong performance we've seen in our NIM management program, which is higher than our prior outlook, and good momentum in the fee businesses as we look forward. We want to quickly address the lessons learned from the last year's environment, address the new regulations coming around Basel, C-CAR, resolution finding, and ultimately enhance our risk management, so we can operate from a position of strength just as we are right now going forward, which will require investment. So the kind of things that are driving that roughly 1.5% higher run rate are invested into teams like Treasury, risk management, technology. It's with a focus on enhancing data, underlying process capabilities and automation. The goal, in the end, if I take a step back, is to get ahead of these requirements to quickly move through this period. We expect to see around a year's worth of this higher expected run rate of expenses, again, around 1.5% higher. And then that expense growth rate will come back down again as we exit 2024, and we'll see the underlying core expense management come through. It all goes back to the goal of maintaining our vibrancy, our momentum, and really ensuring that Huntington continues to be in the position of strength to go forward. Steve Steinour : This is Steve. Just to sort of come in over top of that, we think this is the time to be dynamic to play offense, to be front footed in terms of a number of our businesses. And we intend to do that. And that will require investment. We'll have more colleagues, more talent, if you will. We'll have some new capabilities, all of which are in the plan and the numbers Zach shared with you. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then just putting it together because you mentioned you\u2019re modeling NII trends higher as you go through 2024. There's more upside to fees. How does that play into operating leverage for next year? Do you still think you can drive positive operating leverage? Steve Steinour : It's a little [indiscernible] to give you precise guidance on that, but driving toward operating leverage over time is a key element of our goals. You'll remember that is our three major financial targets we've set for ourselves. And we do see solid opportunity for revenue growth next year on both spread and fees. But I would stress again, coming back, what's critical for us is managing for the median term at this point. And we want to make sure that we can maintain those critical investments, even as we're driving the efficiencies in the underlying expense growth rate. Talked about operating numbers over time will absolutely be part of the plan. And we'll have to see the precise outlook for 2024 going forward and to quantify that in more specific ways. Manan Gosalia : Appreciate the detailed answers. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Just on the net interest income front, I know you indicated that you implied -- you expect a trough in the fourth quarter and then expanding through 2024. Maybe can you help us frame the magnitude of growth that you think is achievable under the current curve assumption as you look at the NII upside? And then I guess the same question would be for your commentary around the margin in terms of expansion through the year? Maybe if you can help us size that up in terms of what's a fair assumption based on what you're looking at. Zach Wasserman : Yep, that's a great question. This is Zach. I'll take that one. I think just to take a step back, we saw in the third quarter really highlighted the effectiveness of our overall asset sensitivity management program. We saw NIM expand and the benefits of asset-required pricing really coming through into a stronger NIM. What we saw in the third quarter was about 10 basis points increase in NIM from the second quarter. Around half of that, I will note, are items that were temporary in nature, reducing Fed cash in Q3 from Q2, drove around 3 basis points, we've got some elevated levels of dividend from the FHLB stock that was a function of Q2 FHLB borrowing. Those items won't recur. However, we did see a positive 4 basis point move in underlying spread in the third quarter, as I noted. As we think about Q4, our expectation is to have to see a NIM of between 305 basis points and 310 basis points, which is around 5 basis points or 10 basis points better than I would have thought this time last quarter. And it's really driven by the benefits we're seeing coming through from the higher for longer rate scenario, which as we've noted, we would expect to be accretive to overall NIM, and that is bearing fruit. Based on the trends we're seeing in earning assets, I expect the dollars of NII in Q4 will be down around 4% to 5% from Q3 and informing a trough both in NIM ratio and the NIM and net interest income dollars in the fourth quarter then trending higher from there. The NIM outlook for 2024, I expect to be flat to rising, as I noted. And I think the things you're going to see are continued really solid progress on the fixed asset repricing, major asset categories on the fixed side this quarter are seeing, again, sequential increases since Q3 and we'll expect to see that continuing on, particularly in the higher for longer scenario. Even as we do see data continuing to trend as well, it will be accretive to the overall spread throughout the course of next year we think. We will also benefit, as we've noted before, during 2024 from a gradual reduction in the negative carry from the received fix swap hedge portfolio, we estimate roughly 5 basis points throughout the course of next year on that benefit, mainly in the second half of the year. So I would say a couple that flat to rising NIM with growth in loans, growth in earning asset that, as I noted, it will drive overall NII dollars higher. We'll get more precise with guidance as we get into January. But those are the major drivers that we're seeing at this point. John Pancari : Very helpful, Zach. Thank you for that. And then separately on credit. Criticized loans up 17% linked quarter. It looks like -- and I believe you alluded to in your comments, a lot of that was commercial real estate. Can you -- and I know you added to your reserve and commercial real estate nonperformers are also up pretty sharply. Was there a dedicated effort to scrub the portfolio that you're working through your exposures there that drove a lumpier move here? Or is this the deterioration that's starting to take shape as we all expect in this sector? Rich Pohle : Hi, John, it's Rich. Let me start with that, and then I can turn it over to Brendan to give you a little bit more color on what happened in the third quarter. So if you think back to Q2, our NPA level was at 46 basis points, which was the lowest level we've had since the GFC, and we've had eight consecutive quarters of declines, totaling over $450 million since then. The Q3 level that we're at today, 52 basis points is right around where we were this time last year. So to me, it's not at a level that's concerning to your point around being proactive. We have been a lot of the adds to nonaccrual that we had in the quarter were discretionary. We think about two-thirds of our commercial NPLs are current on their principal and interest. The [crick] (ph) class is a similar story. We had reductions in five of the six previous quarters. And as you talk about credit normalizing, you would expect to see an increase in crick class down from that. So I wouldn't categorize the movements as huge jumps. I think it's just a normal position at very low levels for us. But Brendan, why don't you give a little bit of insight into the Q3 specifics. Brendan Lawlor : Sure. Thanks, Rich. To provide us a little bit more color approximately -- per crick class, approximately 60% of the increase was focused in commercial real estate and our ABL group. There are two places you'd expect to see higher levels. On the FDA side, it was split more equally between commercial real estate and C&I. For both NPA and crick class, as you noted, the real estate exposure was focused mostly in office. And on the C&I side, beyond the ABL concentration I mentioned, there really weren't material concentration. So I think what you're seeing in the numbers, as Rich said, it's just a bounce off a very low bottom. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the detail. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just maybe a question for you, Steve. I think -- I mean, you all have talked about being transported, there are banks that are talking about coming back to loan growth next year. But I'm just wondering if there's going to be a ton of loan demand to speak of for banks to lend into. Just give us a sense of what you seeing across your footprint? Where that loan demand is coming from? Or are you seeing customers get increasingly cautious? Steve Steinour : Ebrahim, great question. Thank you. I believe there's a growing cautiousness in what\u2019s going on in Israel and the Middle East, what's going on in Washington. We've got a UAW strike that does not have an apparent resolution. And I think, businesses are reacting to that. 99% of our customer base, privately owned companies rates are up. They're using their liquidity, but the uncertain economic outlook and where rates are going, all sort of are headwinds to the next round of growth. Having said that, our businesses are doing well. We'll have good growth. We'll be within guidance that we gave you, that Zach gave you earlier in the year, we will be up about 5% year-over-year. And we'll continue to see growth next year, I believe, in a couple of areas in particular. Our distribution finance is a powerful engine. It seasonally reduced this quarter. It will be up in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to grow that by winning new business. We are a significant equipment finance lender. And more and more onshoring, more automation, there'll be continued demand, albeit probably not at the levels we saw in 2022 and before. That will play well. And we're top 10 asset-based lender. So all of those asset related finance activities should do well in this environment. And as you know, we are a huge small business bank. The small businesses will need more support and we'll be there for them. And those will be sources of growth. But there's an overall more cautious outlook within our customer base, just that will have some moderate impact on, I think, on overall loan demand next year. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess a follow-up. Zach, you mentioned solid increases in fixed asset portfolio yield as they repriced. Just talk to us in terms of when these are coming up for repricing? Is it just kind of playing out contractually? If there's some negotiation in terms of the spreads that are narrowing at the time of repricing of these fixed rate loans? And is that kind of impacting credit trends, are some of these borrowers looking a bit worse in terms of their ability to service the debt post repricing? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great questions, and let me address those. So what I'd say is, in terms of the trajectory on asset yield, taking a step back, over 200 basis points through the cycle to date, and it's really been a couple of things, most notably an intentional outcome that we've had in terms of how we're incrementally driving new loan production into -- and really driving for higher returns, which also is often higher NIM. And so we're seeing that come through in a lot of the areas where we're actively modulating and optimizing indirect auto, for example, is a great example that fuels up tremendously on the [indiscernible] course of the cycle. It's also though just a natural outcome of the structure of the balance sheet. And one of the reasons why we added the slide we did this quarter in terms of -- detail there was to just provide more transparency into that. We're around 50% fully variable. So you're seeing benefits of higher rates come through on that portfolio. Another roughly 10% in shorter durated fixed indirect auto. As I just noted, we're seeing really sizable increases in portfolio yield there. Another 10% in arms with a five-year duration, which we're gradually seeing that come through. In the higher for longer scenario, every one of those fixed asset categories, including the longer durated remaining third of the portfolio are really seeing the benefit and we've seen just in Q3, 50 basis points increase in the coupon yields across the portfolio, greater than 20 basis point increase in back book portfolio yields. And I do think that will continue to trend here be more than a key drivers for NIM stability and growth as we go into 2024. We're not seeing any substantive portfolio-wide credit-driven yield repricing [indiscernible] and really, it's much more fundamental as I noted. Steve Steinour : Ebrahim, just to add, we've got a very diversified portfolio. We've been very disciplined with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite over the years, you've seen us report quarterly since 2010 on the consumer book, which is super prime, prime auto and resi, et cetera. So we're sitting in a position we feel is strong, we have confidence in the portfolio and our ability to manage through even in a tougher cycle. And as we've said to our customer base, we've got a relationship orientation. We're here to support them, and we will -- we're in a position to do that with our reserves, our capital, our robust liquidity and that leads us to this stance of playing offense and moving share during these next couple of years. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify if I heard correctly just on the NII. Are we expecting it to grow full year 2023 -- pardon me, full year 2024 over 2023 or just positively off the fourth quarter base? Zach Wasserman : Well, Scott, a great question. [indiscernible] to clarify both [indiscernible] trajectory of growth out the year and on a net basis, full year growth as well, which is going to be a function of flat to rising NIMs and been pretty comparable overall full year NIM year-on-year as well as growth in earning assets and loans. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to kind of revisit the cost equation a bit. Maybe on the initiatives that you began in the third quarter, maybe just some thoughts on how substantial they are? And I guess ultimately -- I guess the question becomes, we'll have about 4% expense growth despite these initiatives sort of begs what cost growth might have been without them. So just any sort of further thoughts on exactly where we're investing, what this will ultimately end up driving et cetera. Zach Wasserman : Yes, terrific question. [indiscernible] to expand on that. If I think about the equation that we were managing in 2023, we've been seeing around a 2%, 2.5% underlying expense growth. And that's with the benefit of significant efficiencies that we're generating this year. I estimate that\u2019s around 1% benefit in expenses in 2023 for these cumulative initiatives we are running for the last six, 18 months and self-funding underlying investments. We've talked about this model before, driving efficiencies is the core, keeping the underlying core at a low level with the funnel and outsized level of investment and expense growth into key investment earnings like tech, marketing, new additions of personnel to support new strategies, those underlying investments are up almost 20% in 2023, which is what we will hold the competitive capabilities that we\u2019ve got. As we go into -- that model is what drove the overall roughly 2.5% growth that we saw in 2023. I think what we're seeing as we go into 2024 is roughly similar sort of underlying expense management program, really modeling down somewhat the underlying adjustments in light of the environment, clearly, but also bearing some modest incremental impacts of just the cumulative inflationary environment and the efficiencies will rise as well. And so, the net kind of underlying run rate that I would have expected into next year is around 2.5%. And then on top of that, we are accelerating, again, these investments in regulatory response, risk management capabilities that represents the additional 1.5% expense growth as we go into next year. That's the 4% trajectory. If I think about where we're investing just to touch on this briefly, continued focus on core strategy investments, delivering the TCF revenue synergies, growing our commercial bank through vertical specialized \u2013 specialties, expertise, digital and product development in our Consumer Banking and Business Banking division, continue to drive the fee revenue strategies and capital markets, payments and wealth. And then on top of that, clearly dealing with these additional areas around Basel III, CCAR, liquidity, interest rate risk management, resolution planning and data and alteration. Steve Steinour : Scott, this is Steve. Just to add on. You'll also see several new initiatives that are also included in that number of 4% and we'll be announcing Q4 and Q1. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And I guess just one final ticky-tack question. The fourth quarter cost increase, will that include any unusual charges the way we saw this quarter? Zach Wasserman : So we saw around $15 million of onetime costs this quarter. Some portion of the onetime costs that we expect to arise as a result of the new initiatives were taking place, we're not able to be accounted for within the third quarter. I'm expecting roughly $10 million additional onetime expenses in the fourth quarter related to those same initiatives. That's not included in the guidance that I gave earlier relatively [indiscernible] scheme of things. So the total one-timers related to those actions, I expect to be approximately $25 million in total, which, again, we've taken $15 million [indiscernible]. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you all very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. So just circling back on capital, obviously, strong, really any ratio you look at including AOCI and I understand the logic of building capital from here given uncertain macro and you're kind of leading in the business. But is there a level that you're like once we get here, it's just more than we need under almost any scenario, and you'd look to deploy it more aggressively? Zach Wasserman : Yes. It's a great question. Let me take a minute to expand on that. As you know, driving capital higher from here is a key focus. We have fully transitioned within the company to managing the primary metric of adjusted CET1, inclusive of AOCI. And on that basis, we're at 8% in the third quarter, our operating range for CET1 is between 9% to 10%. And so we want to drive that 8% ratio up into that operating range of between 9% and 10%, and that's the key goal. I think by the time we get there, I expect that -- we have significant confidence in being able to do that, by the way, over time. By the time we get there, presumably we'll have clarity around the final Basel III requirements, any other implications to capital coming out of the new regulatory environment. And we'll be able to also reassess where the macro environment is and where the lending trajectory are, look to the question we answered earlier. And so, hard to tell sort of exactly where within that range we will want to go. But my expectation is once we get into that range, but we have opportunity to get back to a more normalized capital distribution model, support elevated and longer-term run rate levels of loan growth that we've seen in the past and move through it. I'll just tack on our current working hypothesis and modeling estimate around the Basel III proposal, if it was adopted exactly as was proposed, just roughly 5% increase in RWA based on the phase-in schedule that was proposed as part of the NBR that wouldn't be phased-in until 2027, and will represent about 40 bps of CET1 in 2027. Again as that proposal is written. And so part of this is just quickly get ahead of that even it\u2019s far out of time [indiscernible] and allow us to really move forward on our front foot starts in 2025 and beyond from an accelerated loan growth perspective. Matt O'Connor: Got it. That was helpful. And then just quickly squeeze the mark-to-market impact of the swaptions, maybe it's a silly question, but do we just kind of put in some gains when rates go up and then if rates go the other way, is it mark-to-market on the negative side? Or how should we think about modelling that and the drivers? Zach Wasserman : Let me expand on that, and I'll [indiscernible] just modelling question. Just the strategy of those instruments was to protect capital against really substantive up-rate scenarios. When we purchased them, they were roughly 200 basis points out of the money. We got about 9 months to 12 months of forward life and they would be designed to protect a third to maybe as much as 45% of the securities value at risk in those really substance about 200 basis point to 300 basis point shock scenarios. I think the -- we put a lot of them on early in the second quarter. We added to that portfolio earlier in the third quarter. And we see -- we spent roughly $30 million in premium. So in our view, a pretty small insurance policy for a very significant benefit in those shock scenarios. What we've seen thus far is gains. We saw $18 million of gain in Q2, a $33 million of gain in Q3. That's a $51 million cumulative gain. I'll tell you, if you were to strike them right now, you see another gain in the fourth quarter [indiscernible] March at the very end of the quarter. The answer is yes, in the near term. If rates rise, you see a gain in them. Rates fall, you would see a loss in them. The key thought process for us is how critical is that insurance policy to continue to maintain. And so versus the game in them. If we continue to hold them, I would expect that over time, they would expire unused and out of the money. You see that gain run back through as a negative through fee income if they largely closed out, and we will be dynamic in continuing to watch the interest rate outlook with a primary focus on protection capital. At this point, again, pretty deminimus cash outlay for a really strong insurance policy. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Hi. Good morning. Steve, I know you talked about generally a little bit of softening demand out there. But I wanted to ask to ask you on your auto business, I did notice that your originations were up, and obviously, a lot of peers have pulled away from this business, and it's a business that you guys have been historically very strong and now has really good incremental yield. Just wondering if that's at all an opportunity set and have you kind of -- how do you think through reengaging there as one of those potential growth engines, especially as you've been able to show the deposit stability? Thanks. Steve Steinour : Ken, great question. And auto has performed very, very well for us. We have confidence in its credit and spreads are very attractive. It's a cyclical product and in the past, we -- when spreads have widened, we've chosen to do a bit more. We'll be dynamic as we look at this as the interest rate environment clarifies. And it's a short -- it's a relatively short asset. It's roughly a two year average duration. So we like this asset class a lot, and we certainly like it counter cyclically. And that will be something we'll be looking at closely as we go into 2024 and 2025. Ken Usdin : Okay. Great. And then last thing, Zach, just looking at what you moved around a little bit on the swaps portfolios. Can you just kind of walk us through some of your decision trees with regards to this quarter's terminations and locking in here and any anticipated future activity you're thinking about in terms of just the book as it stands going forward? Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Absolutely, absolutely. And I will tell you this is a very dynamic and active discussion, it\u2019s really a pretty rigorous data and analysis process that we do. And it's always focused on two key strategies. Protecting capital against upgrade scenarios and projecting NIM against downgrade scenarios. I'd like -- in the prior question around the pay fix swaptions, you did add during the quarter to that, anticipating that rates had the strong potential of moving higher and want to protect capital against that and we did [indiscernible] as you saw, clearly, and so that benefited us there. But what's interesting as well is that the curve has steepened, the long end has come up as much as it has. The opportunity to optimize and can take incremental downgrade hedging opportunities in a more efficient manner with less upfront negative carry is increasing. I would say as it relates to that, our view is still lagging into it, no big bets, and we're seeing very significant benefits that come through in the base asset sensitivity, clearly, but over the longer term, I think out into 2025, 2026, 2027, we certainly want to protect those revenue streams and will we see the opportunity to increase downward hedging here if the environment continues to be what it is. In the meantime, it's more of an optimization effort, I would say. You saw us exit some received fixed swaps in Q3. This was mainly a shorter duration, just less efficient structures by [indiscernible] increased the capacity to re-up for longer structures. We entered in some collars, which would give us the option for downgrade hedging rates are attractive out of the future. And I do suspect that there'll be more of that downgrade hedging opportunity, as we go throughout Q4 and into the part of next year if the curve continues to be the way it's shaped now. Ken Usdin : Okay. And is there a way of kind of just putting all that together in terms of like the net impact of the swaps book on your NII and is that getting better going forward or worse? Can you just kind of help us put it in context, if you can? Zach Wasserman : Yes. That's a great question. So just zooming into 2024 for a second, based on the swaps that we've got in the portfolio today, I do expect we're seeing roughly a 15 basis point to 17 basis point drag in [indiscernible] 15 in Q3, I expect to be roughly 17 bps of drag in Q4 of 2023 from the overall swaps coming through NIM. As I noted one of the earlier questions in this hour, by 2024 I expect that to reduce by about 5 bps, particularly into the second half of the year when the curve starts to fall in the forecast. So that's probably the best way to answer your question. And the goal is to call it a NIM really just to support it in this type of range for years we can. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank, Erika. Zach Wasserman : Thank, Erika. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Rich or Brendan, what's the message you want to send us on the outlook for provision and reserves. I mean it feels like you feel fine on credit, but I'm curious if you feel you need to build reserves and how you want us to think about provision? Rich Pohle : Yes. Let me just start with kind of where we are in the quarter. We bumped up by 3 basis points our coverage ratio. It was really a 1% dollar increase, it went up $26 million, and we put most of that into the commercial real estate reserve, just given the uncertainty that we've got there. Where we go from here, I mean, we don't give specific guidance around the coverage ratio, particularly around the provision. But it's going to depend on where the economy goes to the extent that we see further weakening, we'll reevaluate it. But I would imagine that any builds from here would be similar to what you would see in the third quarter, fairly nominal from a dollar standpoint, we might be moving some things around. But in general, we feel really good about where the reserve is right now. And as we get to the other side of this and the economic outlook starts to improve, you can see us bringing the coverage ratio back down into that 160 range over time. So we'll look at it every quarter, Jon, and -- but we feel good about the 196 right now. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Late in the call, Steve, but just a bigger picture question for you. You had a good quarter. But when I saw the guide for the fourth quarter for lower NII and higher expenses and then for the expense guide for 2024, you kind of pulled back some of that optimism. I guess my bigger -- and I think you understand that. But my bigger picture question is, what's the message for 2024? Is that -- is it a year of investment and you're not going to push revenue growth? Or are we just all being a little bit too pessimistic here and just focusing on the expenses and some of the near-term NII headwinds? Steve Steinour : Zach also talked about improving net interest income and NIM at 2024. So I don't think of that as -- our outlook is not of a negative nature. We're investing in the businesses, we're going to do a number of things that I think will position us really well for the medium term, like 2025, 2026 in terms of further growth. We'll have some new capabilities and some additional talent in the company. We'll be in a position to manage with data and processes even better as we go forward. We're accelerating some of our multiyear plans into 2024. And as Zach said, that's -- that growth outlook or expenses in 2025 comes back to a more normal level. So this is us being intentional, position the company to play OpEx and we think we're in that position. We are confident on our credit. We've got good and growing capital on both a gross and an adjusted basis. Liquidity is exceptional. The deposit growth continues. And as you saw in 2010 to those who were around in that period of time, there are moments to take advantage. That's when we launched [indiscernible] as we do a number of things in the commercial bank and really opened up SBA lending, et cetera. We think this coming year is one of those moments, and we intend to put out those. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. So it's -- okay, that's good. I had to ask it, Steve, I'm getting asked that question, but I just needed to know if you're optimistic or pessimistic for 2024, and it sounds like you're\u2026 Steve Steinour : We are optimistic about 2024 and beyond. And beyond, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : All right. All right. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : Steve, I heard all the commentary for the past hour on expenses. And I guess what I still to understand is, is the step-up in expense growth in 2024, is that tied to you seeing a better revenue environment to absorb a higher level of spend or is something going on that's going to require you to be spend more in 2024 agnostic for the revenue environment? Steve Steinour : So we're gearing the company to manage a growth dynamic that we expect will be in place in 2024 and beyond. We also are accelerating certain multiyear investments into 2024, so that we're in an even better position with data, and it's principally data to manage in -- managing company, right? We're at different scale outpost TCF. We saw a lot of unique activity in March around Silicon Valley, things move very quickly. We want -- and board wants better data, better access to information that we have and make pushing a button together. So -- we've been on a multiyear journey. We're going to pull that forward and position the company to be even stronger. We've been managing market risk as you've seen with us hedging about half of our AFS portfolio since 2019. But our processes have not been as automated as we would like them to be, given the speed at which things can change. And so we said we would take advantage of lessons learned out of Silicon Valley and others in this most recent episode, and that has resulted in us making a number of adjustments in our treasury and core policies that I think will prove to further bolster our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and then these investments in data and some other areas in addition to the revenue area investments, will also position us to more effectively manage the company on a real-time basis. Steven Alexopoulos : And will this step the pace of investment? Is that a 2024 story? Or is it a 2024 and beyond story? Steve Steinour : But we're trying to pull things forward into 2024 as Zach said, and as we think about 2025 and beyond, we'll be back to a more normalized. Again, this is -- this was an electional part, an overall view of trying to take advantage of the environment that we see in 2024 and beyond and position the bank for growth. [indiscernible]. Steven Alexopoulos : Well, it sounds like it's partially opportunistic and partially you need to invest in systems, right? It sounds like that portion of this too? Steve Steinour : We had multiyear plans that were accelerating. That's choice. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. If I could ask one last question. So I don't know if you can [indiscernible] recently was asked about crossing $100 billion, well, you really don't want to cross organically, right? You don\u2019t want to be $101 billion. But you guys had $186 billion today. How do you see this with these proposed changes coming. Do you think you're in a good spot at this asset level? Or do you think you need to boost size and scale to just give what this potentially comes? Thanks. Steve Steinour : We own the risk at risk management. We're going to maintain this aggregate moderate to low-risk appetite. We've done things well in the past. We'll continue to do them in the future. I think the size of the business is not the only determinant. I think the business model itself is very, very important. Part of the strategy over time is to be deep in certain markets for our consumer and regional bank, giving us brand awareness and other attributes that let us continue to grow the core. And then we've invested selectively in a variety of commercial businesses. Our asset finance, our equipment finance and distribution finance. A number of these businesses that and beyond the specialty businesses that are national in nature, complemented by things that we've added on the payment space last year. The acquisition on the investment banking side, all of which give us more pride and capabilities to [indiscernible] to our customer base. And we're going to continue that. We've alluded to additional talent and capabilities in the near term, and we expect to be in a position to start talking about that. But all of that's in that 4% guidance for you for next year. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Great questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Okay. So we're grateful for you joining us today. I just want to compliment [indiscernible] one more time into this last year, Rich got a retirement I mean at the end of the year. And Rich has just been a terrific leader. We've greatly benefited from their experiences. Rich, you position us well as you've heard on the call. So thank you very much. In closing, we're pleased with the third quarter results as we dynamically manage through this environment. We're bearing what we believe we're very well positioned for times such as leased with strong credit quality, improving capital ratios and robust liquidity and it\u2019s supported by consistent efforts from about 20,000 colleagues across the bank to deliver these results. We are a team, you know we are disciplined operators and we're executing on our strategy that we outlined last year's Investor Day, and we're driving shareholder value. We're optimistic we're going to continue to do that in the years to come. And as a reminder, we're all aligned, the Board executives and our colleagues, our top 10 shareholder collectively, and we feel they're paying this market pull back. We're very focused on driving consistent strong performance. So thank you for your support and interest in Huntington, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing today can be found on Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting about one-hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Brendan Lawlor, Chief Credit Officer will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Stephen Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our fourth quarter results, which Zach will detail later. These results are again supported by our colleagues across the bank, who live our purpose every day as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. Now on to Slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, we are leveraging our position of strength and executing on our strategic growth initiatives. We are well-positioned to benefit during times like these. We managed our capital levels to enable us to accelerate initiatives during 2023 and support continued growth. We added key specialty verticals in Commercial Banking and expanded into the Carolinas. Second, we outperformed on both deposits and loans throughout the year. Our colleagues are acquiring new customers and deepening our existing customer relationships. Importantly, we delivered this growth, while effectively managing our deposit beta. Third, we expect to modestly expand net interest income as we manage the challenges of the interest rate cycle and are driving increased fee revenues. Fourth, we are rigorously managing credit across our portfolios, consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Credit trends are normalizing as expected, and we continue to believe we will outperform the industry on credit through the cycle. Finally, we remain intently focused on our core strategies. Huntington remained resilient through the events of 2023, emerging as one of the strongest regional banks. We maintained our disciplined execution and we expect to grow earnings over the course of 2024 and continuing into 2025 and beyond. I will move us on to Slide 5 to recap our performance in 2023. Huntington delivered solid results over the course of the year against a challenging backdrop. While the banking sector faced headwinds early in the year, Huntington emerged as a secular winner, gaining new customers, adding over $3 billion of deposit growth and further bolstering our capital. We also increased loans by $2.5 billion for the full-year or 2%, while driving capital ratios higher. We expect the pace of loan growth to accelerate in 2024. We added to our revenue base primarily as net interest income increased by 3.3% for the full-year. We maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and digital capabilities, having again been awarded the number-one ranking by JD Power for both categories. We remained focused on executing our strategies, including growing consumer primary bank relationships by 3%. Additionally, we completed the realignment of business segments. We also delivered on efficiency initiatives, including Operation Accelerate, the voluntary retirement program, staffing efficiencies, business process offshoring and branch and other real estate consolidations. We were nimble and opportunistic, adding key talent this past year, with the addition of three new specialty commercial banking verticals. We also expanded our commercial and regional bank into the Carolinas, adding experienced teams in these attractive and high-growth markets. Additionally, we further strengthened our balance sheet and drove capital ratios higher over the course of the year. We're getting ahead of proposed industry requirements. And finally, credit was managed exceptionally well with full-year net charge-offs of 23 basis points. Moving to Slide 6. Looking ahead to 2024, we have a clear set of objectives. We will leverage our position of strength to increase growth of both deposits and loans. This outlook will result in accelerated revenue growth and is further bolstered by fee opportunities. This posture, coupled with our dynamic balance sheet management and hedging programs is expected to benefit the revenue and profitability outlook for 2024 and further expand into 2025 and beyond. This aligns with the improving macro backdrop, the higher probability of continued GDP growth and the avoidance of a hard landing. While we deliver this accelerated growth, we will continue to maintain our aggregate moderate-to-low-risk appetite. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.15 and adjusted EPS of $0.27. The quarter included $226 million of notable items, primarily related to the FDIC special assessment, which impacted EPS by $0.12 per common share. Additionally, the termination of the pay-fixed swaptions hedging program impacted pre-tax income by $74 million or $0.04 per share. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in at 8.4% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 15.1%. Average deposits continued their trend of growth into the fourth quarter, increasing by $1.5 billion or 1%. Cumulative deposit beta totaled 41% through year end. Loan balances increased by $445 million, as we continue to optimize the pace of loan growth to drive the highest return on capital. Credit quality remained strong. The trend is normalizing, consistent with our expectations and net charge-offs totaled 31 basis points. Allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at 1.97%. Turning to Slide 8. As I noted, average loan balances increased quarter-over-quarter and were higher by 2% year-over-year. We expect the pace of future loan growth to accelerate over the course of 2024. Total commercial loans increased by $125 million for the quarter and included distribution finance, which increased by $225 million, benefited by normal seasonality as manufacturer shipments increased due to inventory build of winter products. Auto Floorplan increased by $359 million and CRE balances, which declined by $361 million, including the impact of payoffs and normal amortization. And all other commercial categories net decreased as we continued to drive optimization toward the highest returns. In Consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $295 million and RV/Marine, which increased by $121 million, while auto loan balances declined for the quarter . Turning to Slide 9. As noted, we continued to gather deposits consistently in the fourth quarter. Average deposits increased by $1.5 billion or 1% from the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Growth was maintained each month throughout the fourth quarter, continuing the recent trend. Total cumulative deposit beta ended the year at 41%, in-line with our expectations and reflecting the decelerating rate of change we would expect at this point in the rate cycle. As we've noted in the past, where beta ultimately tops out, will be a function of the end game for the rate cycle in terms of the level and timing of the peak and the duration of any extended pause before a decrease. Given market expectations for rate cuts to start sometime in 2024, our current outlook for deposit beta remains unchanged, trending a few percentage points higher and then beginning to revert and fall if and when we see rate cuts from the Fed. When interest rate cuts commence, we expect to manage betas on the way down with the same discipline as we have during the increasing rate cycle. Turning to Slide 11. Non-interest bearing mix-shift continues to track closely to our forecast with deceleration of sequential changes. The non-interest bearing percentage decreased by 80 basis points from the third quarter, and we continue to expect this mix-shift to moderate and stabilized during 2024. On to Slide 12. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $52 million or 3.8% to $1.327 billion. Net interest margin declined sequentially to 3.07%, in-line with our forecast. Cumulatively over the cycle, we have benefited from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins with net interest revenues growing at an 8% CAGR over the past two years. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q3, we saw a decrease of 13 basis points. This was primarily due to lower spread, net of refunds, which accounted for 9 basis points, along with a 2 basis point negative impact from lower FHLB stock dividends and a 2 basis point reduction from hedging. Turning to Slide 13, let me share a few added thoughts around the fixed-rate loan repricing opportunity that will benefit us over the moderate term. The construct of our balance sheet is approximately half fully variable rate, 10% in indirect auto, which is a shorter approximately two-year average life, and 10% in ARMs with a four-year average life. The remainder of approximately 30% is longer average life fixed-rate. We have seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio yields thus far in the rate cycle. Even as the forward curve forecast lower short-term rates, many of our fixed-rate loan portfolios retained substantial upside repricing opportunity for some time to come. We forecast approximately $13 billion to $15 billion of fixed-rate loan repricing opportunity in 2024, with an estimated yield benefit of approximately 350 basis points. Slide 14 provides the drivers of our spread revenue growth. As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios. The basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the lower end by a scenario which includes five rate cuts in 2024. The higher scenario assumes rates stay higher for longer and tracks closely with the Fed's dot plot from year end. This scenario assumes three cuts in 2024. We continue to be focused on managing net interest margin in a tighter corridor. Should the lower rate scenario play out and we see rate cuts as early as March, that will likely result in a margin over the course of the year within a range near the level we saw in the fourth quarter. This would equate to a net interest margin between 3% and 3.1% for each quarter of 2024. If the higher for longer scenario comes to pass, we expect the margin to expand and at a level that is up to 10 basis points above that. As we saw in December, the outlook for longer-term interest rates also moved lower significantly. There were a number of benefits from this lower market rate outlook. First, it resulted in higher capital levels given AOCI accretion, which supports our accelerated loan growth outlook now. Second, it provides for easing deposit competition over time. Third, it provides credit support for borrowers with the potential for locking in lower long-term rates. However, the rate outlook is incrementally more challenging for full-year spread revenue than the levels we had seen underlying our guidance in December. Net of these items, including the forecasted pace of loan growth, we now expect net interest income on a dollar basis to trough in the first quarter before expanding sequentially from that level over the course of the year. Turning to Slide 15, our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at $93 billion and has grown quarter-over-quarter. At quarter end, we continue to benefit from a diverse and highly granular deposit base with 70% insured deposits. Our pool of available liquidity represented 206% of total uninsured deposits, a peer-leading coverage. Turning to Slide 16, our level of cash and securities at year end increased as we've begun to reinvest portfolio cash flows during the fourth quarter. This investment strategy is consistent with our approach to continue to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over-time. We have reduced overall hedge duration of the portfolio from 4.1 years to 3.7 years over the past 18 months. Turning to Slide 17, we've updated our forecast for the recapture of AOCI. As of year-end, we've recaptured 26% of total AOCI from the peak level at September 30th. Using market rates at year end, we would recapture an estimated incremental 44% of AOCI over the next three years. Turning to Slide 18, we continue to be dynamic in positioning our hedging program. As the rate outlooks changed over the course of the fourth quarter, we focused our objective incrementally on the protection of NIM in down rate scenarios and actively reduced instruments that were intended to protect capital in up rate scenarios. As we announced in late December, we terminated the pay-fixed swaptions program as our assessment of the probability for substantial upgrade moves decreased. Over the course of Q2 through Q4, this program worked as intended, providing significant protection against possible tail risk up-rate moves with a modest overall cost for that insurance. Additionally, during the quarter, we added to our down rate NIM protection strategies, adding $2.1 billion of forward-starting received fixed swaps and adding $1 billion of floor spreads. We exited $2 billion of Collars, which were near expiration. Our objective with respect to our down rate hedging activities remains unchanged, to support the management of net interest margin and as tighter range as possible. Moving on to Slide 19, our fee growth strategies remain centered on three key areas : capital markets, payments and wealth management. Note, this quarter in our earnings materials, we've updated the presentation of our non-interest income categories in order to more clearly highlight our strategic areas of focus and more closely align to the way we manage the business. Slide 35 in the appendix provides further detail on the components of each line item. These three key focus areas for fee growth collectively represent 63% of total non-interest income. We're seeing positive underlying growth in each of these areas. In capital markets, we're pleased that revenues expanded sequentially, both advisory and core banking capital market products grew in the quarter. Our outlook is constructive for 2024 and we expect capital markets to remain a key driver for-fee revenue growth over the medium-term. Payments and cash management revenue includes debit and credit card revenues along with treasury management and merchant processing. Our payments opportunity is substantial, reflecting 31% of total fee revenues today, with the potential for significant growth over-time. Wealth and asset management revenue has benefited from the realignment earlier this year, which brought together our private bank and retail advisory businesses under one umbrella. Our advisory penetration rate of the customer base continues to increase as wealth advisory households have grown 11% year-over-year and assets under management are up 16% from a year-ago. Moving on to Slide 20. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income decreased $104 million to $405 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions and the CRT premium, fees increased by $5 million quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to Slide 21 on expenses. GAAP noninterest expense increased by $258 million and underlying core expenses increased by $47 million. As I mentioned, we incurred $226 million of notable item expenses related primarily to the FDIC deposit insurance fund special assessment during the quarter. It also included the last portion of costs related to our staffing efficiency program in corporate real estate consolidations. Excluding these items, core expense included higher personnel and professional services, driven by seasonally higher benefits expense, incentives, as well as consulting expenses. The level of expenses we saw in the fourth quarter is largely consistent with the dollar amount we expect quarterly over the course of 2024. This is inclusive of the investments we've discussed previously, as well as sustained efficiencies we are driving across the company. Slide 22 recaps our capital position. Reported common equity Tier 1 increased to 10.3% and has increased sequentially for five quarters. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI was 8.6%. This metric increased 58 basis points compared to the prior quarter, driven by adjusted earnings net of dividends as well as the benefit from the credit risk transfer transaction we announced in December, which more than offset the impact from the FDIC special assessment. We also saw a significant benefit from AOCI recapture given the move in rates during the quarter. Our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher, while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth. We intend to drive adjusted CET1 inclusive of AOCI into our operating range of 9% to 10%. On Slide 23, credit quality continues to perform very well and with normalization of metrics consistent with our expectations. Net charge-offs were 31 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than Q3 by 7 basis points and resulted in full-year net charge-offs of 23 basis points. This outcome was aligned with our outlook for full-year net charge-offs between 20 and 30 basis points at the low-end of our target through-the-cycle range for net charge-offs of 25 basis points to 45 basis points. Gross charge-offs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with the overall change in net charge-offs largely result of lower recoveries. Given ongoing normalization, non-performing assets increased from the previous quarter, while remaining below the prior 2021 level. The criticized asset ratio increased quarter-over-quarter with risk rating changes within commercial real estate being the largest component. Allowance for credit losses was higher by 1 basis point to 1.97% of total loans. And our ACL coverage ratio continues to be among the top-quartile in the peer group. Let's turn to our outlook for 2024. As we mentioned, we expect to drive accelerated loan growth between 3% and 5% for the full-year. Deposits are likewise expected to continue their solid trend of growth between 2% and 4%. As a result of the loan growth and margin outlook I shared earlier, net interest income for the full-year is expected to range between down 2% to up 2%. The pace of loan growth coupled with the rate scenario we see actually play out, will drive the range of spread revenue. If the higher for longer rate scenario plays out and loan growth tracks to the top-end of our range, we expect net interest income to grow by approximately 2%. If the lower scenario comes to fruition and loan growth tracks to the lower end of our growth range, we could see spread revenue declining 2 percentage points. In both scenarios, I expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter before expanding throughout 2024 from that level. Non-interest income on a core underlying basis is expected to increase between 5% and 7%. The baseline of core excludes notable items, the mark-to-market impact from the pay-fixed swaption program as well as CRT impacts. Fee revenue growth is expected to be driven primarily by capital markets, payments and wealth management. Core expenses are expected to increase by 4.5%, this level reflects the finalization of our budget and includes the additional loan growth we discussed earlier, which will have some incremental compensation expense tied to production. Expenses could fluctuate depending on the level of revenue-driven compensation, primarily associated with our fee-based revenues, including capital markets. The tax-rate is expected to be approximately 19% for the full-year. We expect net charge-offs for the full-year to be between 25 basis points and 35 basis points. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions-and-answers. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Zach. Operator we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. Stephen Steinour : Good morning, Manan. Manan Gosalia : I wanted to start off on the expense guide change. I know it's a small change from 4% to 4.5%, but it is higher than some of your peers are guiding to for 2024. So just hoping you could elaborate more on what's going into that? And also, if there is a similar flex on the expense side as there is on the revenues, so for instance, if you get to -- you were down 2% NII number with more rate cuts, does that drive a little bit of flex in the expense side as well? Zach Wasserman : Great question, Manan. This is Zach. I'll take that. The guidance that we've given back in October and in December was really primarily designed to be an early view for you so you can get and insights to some of the key decisions we're making for us to really be able to discuss that in detail, that was approximately 4% as we discussed before. The finalization of our budget reflects the additional loan growth added to the plan and associated fee revenues as well [indiscernible] represent the differences, up to 4.5% [indiscernible] it\u2019s about $5 million a quarter, so relatively small. I think you are -- and the underlying drivers of that are unchanged from what we have discussed before. We'll continue to drive significant efficiencies and core [indiscernible] expenses with a number of programs. We'll continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We'll execute on the incremental build of capabilities in automation and data, get ahead of the coming regulations and we'll execute on the really attractive commercial growth opportunities we discussed before. All of that's included in that number and no change to our expectation as well about reducing that growth rate as we go into 2024 -- 2025, excuse me, back to more normalized levels. As it relates to your question in terms of marginal sensitivity of it. Certainly, there will be just some degree of that. I think the expense that we guide is generally calibrated interest sort of the middle of the ranges we've guided in terms of revenues and so we saw potential upside of expenses. All of the revenues hit the high-end, likewise some potential opportunity if the revenues went lower. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. And my next question was on the deposit franchise. You have a pretty strong core consumer deposit franchise and some of your peers have highlighted that there is still some lagged upward repricing in deposits there. So can you talk about how you expect those deposits to behave over the next few quarters and then as the Fed begins to cut rates? Zach Wasserman : Yes. This is Zach. I'll take that one again. What we've been seeing in the marketplace broadly with respect to deposit costs and deposit beta, both across both consumer and commercial is the -- as we are looking stack, a deceleration of the sequential changes and very much for us trending highly aligned to our expectations. As well I will tell you that we are beginning to see in the marketplace a fairly constructive initial signs of firms prepared for what will likely be soon a down grader environment with a shortening, for example, time deposit terms with a change of promotional terms on money market and select testing of different price points for these segments in each geography, all of which is what you'd expect to pre stage what will ultimately be a series of down grader moves. With respect to your specific question on consumer [indiscernible] will that trend. I think the answer is yes. What we have been saying all along is that, deposit costs and beta will continue to trend at a decelerating rate through the pause period until such time if there is a rate reduction. And so, that's our expectation as well. I won\u2019t say the go-to-market pricing is generally here, pretty consistent if not, again testing somewhat lower price points, but there is of course of sort of embedded momentum of somewhat upward bias in terms of pricing for at least another quarter here and then we'll see. We got rates cuts in March, some aggressive in our view is possible which creates downgrade [indiscernible] rate environment holds out of deposits until September, which is will be kind of a longer period of [indiscernible] Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : [indiscernible] Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. And by the way, whoever wrote that script, the guidance could not be any clearer, so that was great. That being said, a few follow-up questions. The loan growth guidance from your peers would imply that the macro outlook which seems pretty consensus is indicative of software opportunities, and perhaps this is a good chance. Clearly, you've been telling us for the past few years that you've set yourself up differently and you've [indiscernible] differently to outperform. And maybe go back through those opportunities that they think that the average loan growth number is certainly notable versus peers and perhaps remind us of why Huntington is a particularly unique set of growth opportunity for this year? Stephen Steinour : Erika, this is Steve, I'll start with that because you've asked a broader history. And then secondly -- so first, we do think the discipline on our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which has been in place now for 14 years has been a [indiscernible] and it has helped us as we've decided with this just to pursue and whatnot to see. With that in mind, we've been very purposeful and strategic about growing these businesses. And you saw at the Investor Day a mid-teens rate of growth in like a specialty banking. So we have a very strong middle market core banking set of capabilities. We have a tremendous amount of small business capabilities and capacity. We have market density in Ohio on small business and we're achieving that now in other states. So the core sort of regional banking franchise is performing very-very well. When you add to that these specialties that have been put in place, just three new ones last year, which by the way they're all off to a terrific starts. And then the expansion. We've been in like Dallas and Charlotte for a decade or more. When we see opportunities, we then pursue them. An example of that is in the Carolinas, where we believe we've got fantastic group of new colleagues coming to us with teams in to some -- just outstanding people who we've been following for years and it all came together. We were investing, others were not and there was some moment to be dynamic. In addition to that, we still have opportunities in these TCF markets. We are doing incredibly well in Michigan, but I would say, we're early-stage still in Chicago, the Twin Cities and Denver. And we like those markets, each of those margins. So we believe with the investments we made in specialty banking, the core regional bank performing well with opportunity, we've got lots of growth potential in the next few years, and that's where the -- I didn't talk about the asset finance business. So our distribution finance business is a horse. They had a phenomenal year last year. Our auto business is one of our best businesses. We've got one of the really terrific teams in that area and Floorplan has done very, very well in terms of its growth as well. So lots of growth options. The equipment finance more broadly, a lot of growth options in that, and we're seeing that through the cycle. And so, we believe we're poised to outperform and budget it and expect our colleagues to do so in the coming years. This is -- I can just talk on two things. First of all, thanks for the compliment on the guidance and all the credit to our terrific Investor Relations team. But just, one thing I would add on top of that is, we were pretty purposeful about staying on a growth footing across the board, and importantly, in terms of the financial resources and investment that we're putting against our core growth opportunities. And recognize that the net outcome of that, including some of the other things that we wanted to do in terms of data automation capabilities, would result in an overall expense growth that was higher than we would want to have relative to revenue growth, higher than we would typically target. And it certainly was something we discussed at length, as you know. But we took that view purposely and recognized it was contrarian, because in our view, the long-term earnings potential of staying in that growth posture is so much more advantageous than worry to have really significantly rationed back investments and expenses. And so, a bit of short-term challenge with respect to operating that will yield very significantly better earnings growth trajectory through the course of 2024 and 2025, the earnings outlook looks exceptionally strong as well. So just to tap on Steve's point, I think the whole system is really working and [indiscernible] results here. Erika Najarian : For sure, and you had the capital, so it all makes sense. And just a follow-up question, again, so many moving pieces in terms of the rate outlook, but Zach, if maybe update us on your rate sensitivity as of 12/31, how does some of the [Technical Difficulty] in terms of your balance sheet management? And also, if you could give us a little bit more detail about what you mean in terms of managing the betas on the way down in a similar discipline? And I wonder if you could give us maybe your expectations on deposit beta for the first hundred basis points of rate cut. Zach Wasserman : Sure. Great questions. There's a lot in there to unpack. So let me address those both. As it relates to asset sensitivity for December, I expect it to be roughly consistent with the asset sensitivity we saw, that was reported in October. And you'll see that come out in the Q. I'm sorry, in the K. As we've discussed over time, the business is naturally asset-sensitive. And so clearly on the way up with the industry cycle, we've benefited very significantly in terms of margin expansion and revenue growth. I will note as well, something just as important to assess as you're thinking about asset sensitivity is, in our securities portfolio, as you know, we've hedged a large portion of our variable for sale securities, which has benefited significantly in terms of yields rising higher, protecting capital in the asset sensitivity metric in the Dow 100 [rapid] (ph) scenario, for example. It represents about a percentage point of additional sensitivity from those swaps. Those swaps will roll off over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. And most of that impact of sensitivity will begin to ramp off starting in the second half of 2024 and continuing on for about a 12-month period thereafter. The other thing I'll just say is that, as an important point is, those sensitivity metrics are pretty academic and not standardized across the industry with lots of assumptions, the beta being the most significant, but also whether those analyses are ramps on top of the forward curve, or whether they're just from a start point, ours is a ramp on top of the forward curve. So certainly, advising is important to assess those assumptions pretty carefully in comparing those metrics across firms. Back to -- so in terms of our [indiscernible] management posture, incrementally from here I see the opportunity to add downside rate reduction hedges. Our hedging strategy is incrementally shifting from a focus on capital protection to a focus on down rate protection, as we discussed in the prepared remarks. And we added some of that in Q4. I suspect we'll continue to be incrementally adding into those down rate protection strategies over time, which would gradually reduce downside asset sensitivity. In terms of deposit beta and what we would be expecting for the first x basis points, to give you a sense, in the scenario that I'm looking at where rates in fact begin to fall in March and then have five cuts in, even though it\u2019s little more than your scenario, we would expect to see about a 20% roughly down data over a three quarter period by the end of 2024. We would, of course, be less than that if there was an extended pause through the late summertime period, but just to give you a sense of the sensitivity to your question. Erika Najarian : So clear. Thanks so much. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : Good morning. Stephen Steinour : Good morning, John. On the capital front, I know your CET1 increased nicely, about 15 basis points to 10.25 basis points in the fourth quarter. Just as you look at their trajectory here and your outlook for earnings and capital, organic capital generation, how are you thinking about potentially ramping up buybacks and capital return overall? Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Great question, John. Thanks. This is Zach. I'll take that one. We're very pleased with the outcomes around the overall action plan we've had with respect to managing capital and capital priorities throughout the course of 2023, as we've talked about, actively modulating the pace of loan growth to balance additional loan growth and revenue, but also accreting capital and balance sheet equally in the fourth quarter benefiting significantly from a recapture of AOCI, which allows us now to even yet again accelerate the pace of loan growth, as we discussed earlier. And for the foreseeable future, I see us continuing on with that posture, driving the most important capital priority we have is to fund higher-term loan growth. And there is a significant opportunity for us to do that, which is the most value-creating decision that's in front of us. And importantly, at 8.6%, our adjusted CET1 is -- it has been rising a lot. And we want to drive that into the 9% to 10% operating rate that we've discussed over time. So I think for the foreseeable future, we'll continue on with that plan. Once we get into the 9% to 10% range with adjusted CET1, we'll reassess our posture with respect to share repurchases. Over time, share repurchases are a really important part of the value creation model for the company. And I absolutely expect us to get back to them. And we're going to drive to those outcomes as soon as we possibly can. Stephen Steinour : And John, as Zach shared with you in the third quarter call, we are advancing as if the pending capital requirements are in place. So we're building capital now that will meet those requirements should they be adopted. John Pancari : Great. All right. Thank you. And then also for you, Steve, I guess related to that, maybe if you could just talk about the whole debate around the need for scale as you look longer term at the evolution that's going on right now within the regional bank, both the last year's failures and so the regulatory requirements and the need for scale to compete. How do you view the potential for whole bank M&A as a role in Huntington's outlook and what's the earliest do you think from an industry perspective, not necessarily for Huntington, that you think we can actually see a pickup in whole bank M&A given the backdrop and regulators. Stephen Steinour : Well, that's a series of questions, John. I'll try to answer them, but I may miss on one aspect. Let's just back up for a moment. We had three idiosyncratic banks fail. And you've seen the rest of the industry sort of adjust and adapt and respond very quickly. And the core strength of the industry, I don't think, is in question now. For us, we believe in having a very focused, disciplined, and broadly diversified set of businesses. And we've been able to build those and achieve that posture, and it has served us very, very well as we've seen in the second half of last year and continuing to this year. So we're very bullish on our ability to organically grow and expect -- and that's our focus. We'll continue to do that. You may see further announcements from us this year in terms of organic growth moves. And I expect that we will continue to be maybe a bit contrarian, but agile as we continue to advance. We think we have tremendous opportunities already in the business lines that we have. So in terms of scale, I think the regulatory response is in reaction to those three failures, is raising questions about how much [indiscernible] will the industry or banks will benefit from in the industry over time. The expectations have clearly increased, as they should. And we are investing in our risk management platform. I think I shared on the third quarter call, for example, we will have much better intraday visibility of [indiscernible] in the near term as a consequence. There are a series of things like this that we're addressing. Now, I don't know the -- we've been investing in risk management since I arrived in 2009. So I don't know how we compare -- really compare to other banks. We've always viewed the stress test results where we've been top quartile or even leading in terms of the portfolio stresses by the regulators as a barometer. And it looks like that was a very good measure, at least at this point. So we're not anticipating a change in posture at this stage. We don't feel compelled. We have to do something. And yet, at the same time, should there be opportunities somewhere in the future, we take a look. But it has to be in a risk-adjusted context that makes sense to us. And I don't see that activity in 2014. I think we've got a tremendous amount of core growth to deliver and we're excited by that. John Pancari : Great. Thanks, Steve. Stephen Steinour : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning everybody. Stephen Steinour : Good morning, Steve. Steven Alexopoulos : So I want to start -- for you, Zach, big picture. So historically, a steep yield curve has been a positive catalyst for bank margins and earnings. But given how you position the balance you write with the use of hedges, have you in essence created a way much of that potential benefit in order to have a more stable NIM today? Zach Wasserman : Great question, Steve. I think the short answer to your question is no. A steeper yield curve continues to benefit us. Obviously, that environment would be indicative of funding costs, which would represent solid margins against where asset yields are. I think we're in this really strange environment with inverted yield curves and with the dramatic reduction forecasted pretty quick here. So we'll see how it all plays out. But I think for us, the puts and takes with respect to NIM outlook in the moderate terms in 2024, one, we're going to continue to benefit very significantly from fixed asset repricing. I tried to provide some incremental clarity about that in the prepared remarks and the presentation. But see 50 basis point to 100 basis point moves in overall portfolio yield in key categories will continue to see that benefit us, not only to 2024, but to 2025 and beyond. Another thing is, for us, as the curve becomes less inverted, we'll see our negative carry from our down rate hedge protection program reduce. The negative carry, in fact, by the way, in Q4, it was around 17 basis points of drag. We've talked about likely we'll see about 10 bips of that come back to us. We believe the scenario will pretty align a forward curve here over the next four quarters. Funding costs, again, in a steeper yield curve environment where [indiscernible] rates have fallen, will really start to benefit us in terms of beginning to pivot toward down beta, and actually executing on down beta, since Erika's question earlier. And those things in total essentially offset for us in our NIM, the variable yield reduction that we'll see if and when the short end comes down. So I still believe that that [indiscernible] scenario of a nice upward slope in yield curve is accretive to margin, sort of supportive of it. And the goal we've got is the same, to try to really collar the NIM here, put a floor under it, and really position for upside. And I think the last thing I'd say is, kind of picking up to your question as well. The modeling that we have done about 2025, and we've been saying this for a while, really highlights NIM expansion opportunities, which again, is sort of an indication that the upward slope in yield curve is positive. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, that's helpful. Zach, I asked the question because earlier you said if the rates stay higher for longer, your NIM would be about 10 basis points higher in 2024 versus the Fed cutting. But as we move beyond 2025, 2026 there's a clear benefit to the NIM. Are you able to quantify for us like on a longer term basis assuming the forward curve played out, given what's on and what's rolling off. Where the NIM could be long term for Huntington? Zach Wasserman : Sure. Yesh. But the point on the higher NIM and the scenario will stay higher for longer, it's not only a scenario where short end stays higher for longer, but also longer end stays higher for longer. I will note, historically much of our balance sheet yields key off the belly of the curve, the two to five year range. So I think that's an important point to consider. Look over the longer term I see north of three -- into the low three\u2019s in terms of NIM as a sustainable level. Of course, the business mix continues to shift. So I think it's hard to really be precise about that. [indiscernible] several years out, we'll have to continue to do our modeling. But over the foreseeable future, we see that range of 3 to 3.10 in a quicker rate reduction scenario, maybe as much as 10 bips higher than that, if rates stay higher for longer through 2024. And then I would see another step up into 2025, assuming the yield curve holds generally [indiscernible]. Steven Alexopoulos : Okay, Thanks for taking my question. Zach Wasserman : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Stephen Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : A couple of guidance clarifications for you, Zach. When you say 1Q net interest income is a trough, how deep is that trough, how much lower? Where do you want us to start, I guess, for 1Q? Zach Wasserman : Good question. Q1, by the way, is typically seasonally lower, just with day count and just other mixed items. And so, I think we'll probably see a level that is lower than Q4 by around the same amount that Q4 was lower than Q3, and then begin to grow from there. And so, it's really the trajectory from there that's really the major difference in the guidance range, given that, if you just pull back loan growth, I would expect, in Q1 we will be about the same year on year as we saw Q4 and year around 2%. And then steadily accelerating from there and ending the year growing at or even potentially above the high end of the loan growth range. The average should be 3% to 5% that I discussed. There's a trajectory for sure during the year. And likewise, in terms of NIM, I think it's likely that the NIM will likely meet its lowest point in the year in the first quarter and then kind of rising pretty heavily depending on the scenario you look at. But that's a general trajectory I'm expecting. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. I think it's important to set that up. And then on expenses, when you say consistent, there's a lot of hand-wringing last quarter on your expense guide. And when you say consistent, are you basically saying flat-line expenses quarterly for 2024, meaning that all the expense investments and hiring and things that you've done are essentially in the run rate today and you don't see a lot of these pressures as 2024 progresses, is that fair? Zach Wasserman : That's an excellent point, I really appreciate the chance to clarify that. Broadly speaking, the answer is yes. The dollar amount of expenses overall we saw in core basis in Q4, the forecast we've got in our budget represents pretty similar dollar amounts overall for each of the quarters during 2024, coincidentally. In my [indiscernible] illustrate this picture for you, there's a variety of factors that are offsetting each other and driving within that. I would say there's still a little bit of additional ramp-up of run rate, some of the incremental capability investments that we're doing. Likewise, a little bit of additional ramp up on some of these new initiatives like in the commercial business. We're also actively tuning our overall strategic investments to modestly offset that. And then lastly, you've got these efficiency programs, which are cumulating in their impact over time. The business process re-engineering initiative we've been driving for quite some time. We internally call it Operation Accelerate. The business process offshoring initiative, which by the way is also growing, accumulating. So there's sort of a series of factors that are netting together, but the result of it is basically dollars that are pretty consistent with [indiscernible] to Q4. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our next question will be from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is [Nate Stein] (ph) on behalf of Matt. I just wanted to ask about commercial credit. Commercial real estate net charge-offs increased versus 3Q levels. Can you talk about what drove that and just touch on the outlook for commercial real estate credit quality this year? And then on the C&I side, these also continue to normalize. Can you talk about what you're seeing in this book? Thank you. Brendan Lawlor : Sure, Nate. This is Brendan. I'll take that. For the quarter, yes, we did see on a basis of my perspective, there was an increase in the commercial real estate side. But I want to point you to the dollars there. It was $20 million of charge-offs in the quarter. And it really represented three transactions. So it's consistent with our view of the real estate portfolio at this time, which is from a charge off perspective, the focus will be in the office portfolio. That's where we think that there is potential for lost content, which is why we've increased our reserves to approximately 10% there. And so, what you're seeing in the current quarter is sort of the manifestation of that message that we've been delivering for some time. When I take a step back and look more broadly, the portfolio on commercial in general is actually performing pretty well. The C&I side of the house has had its individual idiosyncratic issues. But in general, the strength of the portfolio is the result of our strong portfolio management and our low to moderate risk profile that we target. So I feel really good about the commercial portfolio at this time. Stephen Steinour : So, Nate, it\u2019s Steve. The charge-offs -- gross charge-offs in Q3 and Q4 were $2 million apart. It was very, very similar. The difference was in all of their coverings. The pre-portfolio is performing very well. The office portfolio has had minimal losses, 23 bips for the year. Q1 charge-offs is outstanding. We're very pleased with how the performance has occurred, and we're confident going forward. Thanks for the question. Unidentified Analyst : All right, thank you. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the criticized assets. So these also kicked up in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? Brendan Lawlor : This is Brendan again, Nate, as Zach said in the prepared remarks, it really came out of our commercial real estate portfolio. The impact of higher short-term rates has persisted, and that's what's reflected in those results. Again, we have been signaling through the second half of last year that we expect the criticize to move up, and that's exactly how it played out. Again, we have good confidence in our client selection in that portfolio and solid reserve against it overall. So I guess I would classify that as just more credit normalization across the portfolio. Stephen Steinour : Thank you for the question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Stephen Steinour : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just wanted to follow up on the loan growth guide, Steve. It does feel at the higher end of what we've seen over the last week from your peers. Not -- sorry if I missed it, but give us a sense of how much of this is just market share gain that you expect versus the underlying growth that you're seeing in these markets and your expectations, I guess, like the GDP growth? Stephen Steinour : Well, we've had growth last year of 2%. If anything, I think the signal from the Fed pivot will foster further loan growth for the industry. We are in an advanced position. And so, we'll capture a share from that, but we also have these specialty banking initiatives in the Carolinas, and they begin with no portfolio, so there's no prepayment, repayment risk, obviously, and that's all net long-run, but those groups are off to terrific starts. We're very, very pleased with the quality of the colleagues who've been able to attract to Huntington, and I'm quite confident in our teams, both the core teams that they'll deliver in our footprint, the speciality banking teams. And frankly, our consumer lending teams are outstanding as well. So as we come into the year, we've got momentum and we're going to continue to invest in these businesses and that cumulatively should help us achieve or even exceed the goals. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess what I didn't hear, Steve, was any mention of fiscal stimulus, the Chips Act, et cetera, flowing through your market. Is that not as meaningful going forward around moving the needle on growth? Stephen Steinour : The markets have -- broadly speaking, we're talking about 11, 12 states that were in with our network. But here in Columbus, which is what you're referring with the [Intel] (ph) plant. That plant is well under construction, and the supply chain commitments will largely be made, we think, this year as they move towards opening in the following year. So we have some unusual factors that are strengthening the outlook here in greater Columbus. And we have very, very significant market share here and lead by a lot in most categories. But it will also benefit the broader region. And that's one of just many sectors that have chosen the Midwest. Think about batteries from East Michigan, Ann Arbor, through Columbus, and some of the announcements last year, including the Honda joint venture here in greater Columbus on the battery front. There's a lot of investment that's being made in the core footprint, all of which will generate economic benefit for the industry, and certainly for us with our leadership position in many of these areas. Thanks for the question. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Stephen Steinour : So I think we're hitting the top of the hour. I'm just going to wrap. I want to thank you very much for joining us today. In closing, we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as we dynamically manage through this environment. We believe we're well positioned. Investments we made in 2023 will further drive revenue growth in 2024 and beyond. Our focus is on driving core revenue growth, carefully managing expenses to support investments in the business, and growing loans consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. The management team is focused on executing our strategies that we previously shared. And as a reminder, the board executives, our colleagues, we're not just shareholders. And that creates strong long-term alignment with our shareholders generally. And finally, we're grateful to our nearly 20,000 exceptional colleagues who delivered these outstanding results and our perennial award winners for customer service. Thank you all very much. Appreciate your interest and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Tim. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, Operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President, and CEO and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Brendan Lawlor, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Stephen Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our first quarter results, which Zach will detail later. Again, these results are supported by our colleagues who live our purpose every day, as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive, and strengthen the communities we serve. Now on to Slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, we are executing our organic growth strategies and leveraging our position of strength. As planned and managed over the years, our liquidity and capital metrics are top tier. Second, we delivered loan growth in the quarter and expect the pace to accelerate over the remainder of the year. Our teams are acquiring new customers and relationships in both commercial and consumer categories. We are maintaining our momentum in deposit gathering with a well-managed beta. Third, we expect to drive sequential increases in net interest income and fee revenues from the level reported in the first quarter, supported by accelerating loan growth, coupled with effective balance sheet management. Fourth, we continued to rigorously manage credit, consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Finally, we are positioned to power earnings expansion over the course of the year and into 2025. Our investments are delivering results and the underlying core is performing well. I will move us on to Slide 5 to recap our performance. We delivered long growth with balances growing by $1.6 billion from a year ago and have grown by a 4% CAGR over the past two years. This pace reflects our intentional optimization efforts last year, and we believe we are positioned to accelerate growth over the course of 2024 and carrying into 2025. Deposit balances also increased, growing $7.9 billion, or 5.5% over the past year. Capital remains strong with reported common equity tier 1 of 10.2% and adjusted common equity tier 1 of 8.5%, inclusive of AOCI. Liquidity remains top tier with coverage of uninsured deposits of 205%, a peer-leading level. Credit quality was stable as debt charge-offs improved by 1 basis point from the fourth quarter to 30 basis points. We are sustaining momentum and growth of our primary bank relationships, with consumer and business increasing by 2% and 4% respectively year-over-year. We continue to seize opportunities to add talented bankers. Over the past two quarters, we've added teams in the Carolinas and Texas. We've also launched new commercial specialty verticals including Fund Finance, Healthcare ABL and Native American Financial Services. The momentum we have across our markets, coupled with our strong culture, continues to attract great banking talent to Huntington. We expect to add additional colleagues and capabilities as we move through the year. We have clear objectives for 2024, focused on executing our organic growth strategies. This should result in accelerated loan growth, sustained deposit growth, and expanded fee revenue streams. Coupled with our expense outlook, we expect to see PPNR expanding over the course of the year and into 2025. The macro environment is conducive to growth with customer demand holding up well in a resilient and stable economy. The addition of new markets and bankers is supporting expanding loan pipelines with late-stage commercial pipelines ending the quarter at the highest level in over a year. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.26 and adjusted EPS of $0.28. The quarter included $39 million of notable items, primarily related to the updated FDIC deposit insurance fund special assessment of $32 million, which was driven by higher losses from last year's bank failures. Additionally, we incurred $7 million of costs related to incremental business process offshoring, efficiency plans that were finalized during the quarter. These items collectively impacted EPS by $0.02 per common share. Return on Tangible Common Equity, or ROTCE, came in at 14.2% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 15.3%. Average deposits continued to grow during the quarter, increasing by $1.1 billion or 0.7%. Cumulative deposit beta totaled 43% through quarter end. Average loan balances increased by $701 million or 0.6% for the quarter. Credit quality remains strong with net charge-offs of 30 basis points. Allowance for credit losses was stable and ended the quarter at 1.97%. Turning to Slide 7, as I noted, average loan balances increased quarter-over-quarter and were higher by 1.3% year-over-year. For the quarter, loans increased at a 2.3% annualized pace. We expect the pace of future loan growth to accelerate over the course of 2024. Loan growth was commercial-led for the quarter with total commercial loans increasing by $691 million. Commercial balance growth included distribution finance, which increased by $352 million, benefiting from normal seasonality. Auto floor plan increased by $313 million. CRE balances declined by $31 million. All other commercial portfolios were relatively unchanged on a net basis. Within other commercial, we saw notable strength in regional and business banking balances, as a result of sustained production levels and the continued retention of all SBA loan production on balance sheet. In total consumer loans, average balances were flat overall for the quarter. Within consumer, residential mortgage increased by $137 million, benefiting from production as well as slower prepay speeds. Average auto balances declined by $59 million, however increased by $180 million on an end of period basis. RV/Marine average balances declined by $42 million and home equity was lower by $35 million. Turning to Slide 8, as noted, we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth. Average deposits increased by $1.1 billion in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, deposits have increased by $4.6 billion, or 3.1%. Total cumulative deposit beta continued to decelerate quarter-over-quarter and ended at 43%, consistent with our expectations for this point in the rate cycle. Our current outlook for deposit beta remains unchanged, trending a few percentage points higher so long as there is a pause from the Fed and then beginning to revert and fall when we see rate cuts. Market expectations for rate cuts have clearly been pushed out compared to our January earnings call. We continue to believe that there will be rate cuts over time, and the impact of beta will be a function of the duration in this pause from the Fed. Turning to Slide 9, non-interest-bearing mix shift is tracking closely to our forecast. Average non-interest-bearing balances decreased by $1.3 billion, or 4% from the prior quarter. We continue to expect this mixed shift to moderate and stabilize during 2024. On to Slide 10. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $27 million or 2% to $1,300 million. Net interest margin declined sequentially to 3.01%. Cumulatively, over the cycle, we have benefited from our asset sensitivity and earning asset growth, with net interest revenues growing at a 6% CAGR over the past two years. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q4, we saw a decrease of 6 basis points. This was primarily due to lower spread, net of free funds, which accounted for 9 basis points, along with a 1 basis point benefit from lower average Fed cash and 2 basis points positive impact from other items, including lower hedge drag impact. We continue to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing. We have seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio yields thus far in the rate cycle. And many of our fixed rate loan portfolios retain substantial upside repricing opportunity through 2024 and into 2025. As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios for both short-term rates, as well as the slope and level of the curve. The basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that are bounded on the low end by a scenario that includes 3 Fed Fund cuts in 2024, which tracks closely to the current Fed dot plot. This scenario is also aligned to the forward curve from the end of March for longer-durated time points. It's important to note that the level of the curve in the two-year to five-year term points is an important driver of our asset repricing and spreads. The higher scenario assume rates stay higher for longer with no Fed fund rate reductions this year. This scenario also assumes the longer-durated time points remain at or above the levels at quarter end. In both of these scenarios, as we project further out into 2025, we continue to believe it is most likely that there will eventually be rate cuts at some point as we get into next year. Comparing our latest outlook for those scenarios to the range of outlook we shared in our January guidance, there have certainly been changes given the volatility of rates over the past quarter. Both scenarios now expect Fed funds to stay elevated for longer, which will drive some incremental deposit beta, while the belly of the curve has improved, which will also support asset yields and repricing benefit. It's difficult to predict exactly how the rate environment will play out over the course of the year. As we look at the impact of this rate outlook on our business, the fundamental elements of our prior guidance remain unchanged. There's much of the year left to play out, and as a result, we're maintaining our range for full year spread revenue growth. At the margin, we're seeing somewhat higher funding costs as the expected timing of rate cuts has been pushed out. If this plays out for the full year, our view is that the overall NIM outcome could be a few basis points lower than our previous guidance in both scenarios. Importantly, we're also seeing strong continued deposit growth that is more likely to be at the top end of our deposit growth guidance range, which provides good core funding for our accelerating loan growth. We continue to see Q1 as the trough for net interest income on a dollar basis. We expect sequential growth in spread revenues from this level during the remaining quarters of the year. We also continue to project that a higher rate scenario will produce a higher overall NIM. In this scenario, we would see a more extended trend of higher deposit beta, and hence overall funding costs would be higher, we would also see an incrementally higher fixed asset repricing benefit. Importantly, our core focus is on driving revenue growth and as I noted we continue to forecast that the combination of this margin outlook, coupled with accelerating loan growth, will drive solid revenue expansion from here. This will support accelerating earnings growth rates as we move throughout this year and continue on into 2025. Turning to Slide 11. Our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from sustained deposit growth, as well as our senior note offering and ABS transactions in the first quarter. We expect cash and securities as a percentage of total average assets to remain at approximately 27% to 28% as the balance sheet grows over time. We are reinvesting securities cash flows in short duration HQLA, consistent with our approach to continue to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over time. We have reduced the overall hedged duration of the portfolio from 4.1 years to 3.5 years over the past seven quarters. Turning to slide 12, you can see an updated outlook for AOCI. Based on the rate environment at quarter end, AOCI moved incrementally higher. AOCI at quarter end was 21% lower than the levels we saw in the third quarter. Our outlook continues to forecast a substantial portion of AOCI recapture over the next couple years. Turning to Slide 13, we have updated the presentation of our balance sheet hedging program in order to more directly illustrate the intent of the hedging program. This view shows the effective swap profile in the future, including the effect of forward starting swaps, so you can see more directly the hedging exposures as they will play out over the next two years. Slide 43 in the appendix provides the total notional swap exposure similar to our prior reporting. As of March 31, we had $16.8 billion of effective received fixed swaps and $10.7 billion of effective pay fixed swaps. Our hedging program is designed with two primary objectives to protect margin and revenue and down rate environment and to protect capital and potential up rate scenarios. The pay fixed swaps, which have been effective in protecting capital during this rate cycle, have a weighted average life of just over three years and will begin to mature beginning in the second quarter of 2025. As these instruments mature, our asset sensitivity will reduce. Over time, we intend to gradually add to our down rate protection program at a measured pace. As the rate outlook moved over the course of the first quarter and the yield curve became less negatively inverted, we incrementally added to our down rate protection hedges. We added $3.5 billion of notional forward starting received fixed swaps in the first quarter. Additionally, through the first two weeks of April, we added another $2 billion of forward starting received fixed swaps. The forward starting structure minimizes near-term negative carry while protecting moderate-term net interest margin in 2025 and 2026. These instruments will also reduce the overall asset sensitivity of the business. We will remain dynamic to manage the hedging and interest rate positioning of the balance sheet, and we may make further changes over time. Our current approach is designed to gradually reduce asset sensitivity throughout the next year and a half, while allowing us to maximize the benefit from the current rate environment. Moving on to Slide 14, our fee revenue growth is driven by three substantive areas, capital markets, payments, and wealth management. In capital markets, total revenues declined from the prior quarter, driven by lower advisory revenues. Commercial banking related capital markets revenues increased sequentially since troughing in the third quarter. As commercial loan production continues to accelerate, this will support growth in areas such as interest rate derivatives, FX, and syndications. Debt capital markets is also expected to notably benefit over the course of the year. Within advisory, pipelines and backlog continue to remain robust, and we expect advisory to contribute to growth in capital markets revenues over the remainder of the year. Payments in cash management revenue was seasonally lower in the first quarter and increased 7% year-over-year. Debit card revenue continues to outperform industry benchmarks. Treasury management fees have increased 10% year-over-year as we have deepened customer penetration. We have substantive opportunities across the board in payments to grow revenues over the coming years. Our wealth and asset management strategy is delivering results, with revenues up 10% from the prior year. We are seeing great execution and the benefits of our investments in this area. Advisory relationships have increased 8% year-over-year, and assets under management have increased 12% year-over-year. Turning to Slide 15. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income increased by $62 million to $467 million for the first quarter, excluding the impacts of the mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions in the prior quarter and the CRT, fees declined seasonally by $12 million quarter-over-quarter. Our first quarter fee revenue is generally the low point for the year, and we expect non-interest income to grow sequentially from this quarter's level. Moving on to Slide 16 on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense decreased by $211 million and underlying core expenses decreased by $24 million. During the quarter, we incurred $32 million of incremental expense related to the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Special Assessment, as well as $7 million related to our ongoing business process offshoring program to drive efficiencies. Excluding these items, core expenses were marginally lower in the first quarter than we expected, largely due to timing of certain spend on tech and data initiatives, as well as lower incentive compensation. We continue to forecast 4.5% core expense growth for the full year. From a timing standpoint, we expect core expenses to be higher in the second quarter at approximately $1,130 million. This level should be relatively stable for the third and fourth quarter. There may be some variability given revenue-driven compensation, as well as the pace of expected new hiring activities. This level of expense supports our investments into organic growth strategies as well as data and technology initiatives. Slide 17 recaps our capital position. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.2%. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI, was 8.5% and has grown 60 basis points from a year ago. Our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth. We intend to drive adjusted CET1, inclusive of AOCI, into our operating range of 9% to 10%. On slide 18, credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 30 basis points in Q1, 1 basis point lower than the prior quarter. They remain in the lower half of our through the cycle range of 25 basis points to 45 basis points. Allowance for credit losses was stable at 1.97%. Non-performing assets increased approximately 4% from the previous quarter to 60 basis points, while remaining below the prior 2021 level. The criticized asset ratio also increased approximately 3% quarter-over-quarter, with sequential increases slowing quarter-over-quarter. The overall health of the portfolio is strong and tracking to our expectations. Let's turn to our outlook for 2024. Overall, our guidance ranges are unchanged. On loans, we expect to drive accelerated growth from the first quarter, totaling between 3% and 5% on a full year basis. This will be driven by solid performance in our core, as well as meaningful contribution from the new teams and market expansions. On deposits, we're keeping the overall range the same at between 2% and 4%. We do see it more likely to end up at the higher portion of that range based on our momentum and the traction we're seeing with deposit gathering. Net interest income is expected to be within a range of down 2% and up 2% on a full year basis. As I noted, we see NIM likely a few basis points lower than our earlier guidance. We project spread revenue to expand on a dollar basis from the Q1 level into the second quarter and throughout 2024. Fee growth strategies remain on track, and we continue to see core non-interest income growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. Expense outlook is unchanged, expecting 4.5% core expense growth for the full year. Credit quality, as I mentioned, is tracking closely to our expectations, and we continue to expect full-year net charge-offs between 25 basis points and 35 basis points. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thanks, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Manan Gosalia : Hi good morning. So your comments on the NII guide were very thorough, so I really appreciate that. I think, so the lower end of your guide is now for three cuts, and I think your guide is a little bit more conservative on deposit betas than some of the other comments we've heard. So I was wondering if you can expand on that a little bit. Is that based on conversations you're having with customers or what's driving that? Zach Wasserman : Sure, Manan. Thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll take that. Broadly speaking, we're seeing the NIM outcome, but very similar to the view we had before, just as I mentioned, the sort of moderate tuning lower, you know, clearly the biggest change in the environment over the last three months, since we gave guidance in January, was the expectation for a much longer pause in this Fed posture or any rate reductions. And so at the margin, really we're seeing slightly higher deposit funding costs and overall interest-bearing liability costs. The other thing that's important, and I'm trying to note this in the prepared remarks as well, is that the deposit volumes are coming in very strong and slightly at the higher end of our prior expectation as well. And so that's contributing somewhat, although really good core funding clearly for the accelerating loan growth over time. So that's really the driver. You know, as we entered the quarter, we [just provide one last piece of color] (ph) on that. As we entered the quarter, the market forward was for the first rate reduction to be in March. We always knew that -- that was, we took the view -- that was likely not to be the case, but clearly that was the forecast of the market broadly. And we were beginning to execute the early stages of down beta actions. We've discussed shortening CD term duration, changing other elements of our pricing. You know, as we went throughout the quarter, clearly that reset. And so we've had to continue to be dynamic, as we would always be in managing deposit pricing, and likely now those more substantive downgrade actions will be pushed further out. So that's really the biggest driver of it, sort of the timing of when we'll begin to see more significant downgrade actions. Over time, we would expect to be just as effective going forward as we've been in the past on that -- and it's really just, you know, when will that occur? And hence, a few bps of additional funding costs here in 2024. Manan Gosalia : Now, is any of that because you're also planning ahead of this accelerating loan growth that you're expecting? Zach Wasserman : You know, it's a good question Manan, but the posture, we're in this custody moment here, clearly, of when will rate cuts reduce, and also not only when will the first one happen, but what will be the expected trajectory by the market, and by customers really thereafter. For us, we're very dynamic and granular in how we manage this to really optimize the next best unit of funding here. So continually thinking about when is that rate cut going to happen and obviously attempting to play in front of it. With that being said, we're talking about marginal tuning here and I wouldn't overplay it. Stephen Steinour : And then if I could add, this is Steve. Our commercial pipeline is very robust and each month of the quarter has improved. So we're going into the second quarter with a very good, healthy outlook. As we think about our guidance for the year, we think on the loan side, we're going to be closer to the top end, which is in part the consideration for adding the deposits at the rate that we're doing here at this earlier stage of the year. Manan, thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. John Pancari : Good morning. Stephen Steinour : Good morning, John. John Pancari : So Thanks for the color on the NII guide. Just to confirm again, it does indicate that you are factoring in a higher for longer environment when all said and done in your outlook. But again, you maintain the NII guide of down 2% to up 2%. Is the primary reason for the maintaining that versus any upside by it would be if it mainly the deposit costs that you just discussed coming in higher, or is there any other factor? Zach Wasserman : That is the primary driver. So yes is the answer to that. Seeing a little lower, few basis points lower NIM, but incrementally somewhat stronger loan growth, those things are largely offsetting, and continue to see the ultimate results in that guidance range. And importantly, the keeping for us is that trajectory, growing net interest income on a dollar basis out of the first quarter into the second quarter, and continuing on to the third and fourth quarter, and the outcome of that's going to be solidly expanding revenue growth and solidly expanding profit growth as well. So yes to the fundamentals of your question and the overall outlook, generally unchanged. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, thanks for that, Zach. And then separately, back to the loan growth topic, Steve, you just discussed that you've got confidence in the outlook, particularly given your pipelines. Can you talk about where demand stands now, where utilization is now, and what type of inflection do you see here? Because it seems like you've got confidence in the back half strengthening. I mean, what anecdotal data do you have to kind of support that acceleration? Thanks. Stephen Steinour : Thanks, John. We see the commercial pipeline for the second quarter, particularly the high probability of close level to be very, very good, very strong relative to the last five quarters. So as I said, each month has improved in the first quarter. Second quarter strength is obvious now at this stage. We're also seeing good business banking, loan growth, and we have the benefit of these new initiatives, none of which have [books] (ph) that they're carrying. So the three new initiatives, especially banking last year, and the Carolinas off to a really good start. Texas was there a couple of weeks ago. Got a great team there as well. All of those investments will bolster our activities throughout the year. And then, as you know, we've got one of the largest [split-up] (ph) finance companies in the country. That tends to be somewhat seasonal fourth quarter. So those would be the combination of factors that give us a lot of confidence that we'll be at or near that upper end of our guide for the full year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I kind of wanted to revisit the margin as well. So on the deposit pricing, is it possible to make sort of a broad comment about is this sort of something that you're seeing and reflecting kind of market pricing pressures or would you say you're more on sort of the leading? Because it sounds like we're trying to support the loan growth, which is obviously a very positive differentiated factor. But are you all kind of leading with pricing on the deposit side to fund that growth or what does the competitive dynamic look like as well? Zach Wasserman : Great question, Scott. This is Zach. I'll take it. I would characterize the competitive intensity of the market as generally consistent today with how it was at this time last quarter. So I don't think there's any substantive change. It remains a competitive market, and clients are clearly aware of rate and the competitive rate environment on the consumer, the small business, the commercial side. So it's a transparent market. I think what has happened, part of what we're seeing is, and I'm giving you guidance on it, it\u2019s not just what's happening right now in the market, but the outlook for the whole year. So that's really, I think the way you should interpret these comments is. Whereas before, there was a fairly strong conviction of the marketplace, and even our prior guidance ranges had the first cuts beginning somewhere between March and August, clearly that time frame where cuts has been pushed out. And so the period of time before we can begin to manage substantive downgrade actions has just been extended. And that's really the main driver here. I think our pricing strategy is pretty much the same, which is, continue to price in competitive ways but not lead the markets to be clear and really drive the fundamentals of deposit growth from customer acquisition. We talked about 2% primary bank relationship growth in consumer, 4% in business banking, growing on the commercial side as well. And so that's the underpinning of -- the pricing strategy is really just designed to ensure that there's fair and appropriate pricing as we got on those deposits. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. Perfect. And I think you actually touched on sort of my loan-growth questions in prior responses. So that does -- I appreciate the color. Zach Wasserman : Yeah. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan Chasing Company. Your line is now live. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning, everyone. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Stephen. Steven Alexopoulos : Not to beat a dead horse on the net interest income guidance, but last quarter with three cuts, that got us to the high end of the range. And now three cuts get us to the low end of the range. And I'm somewhat confused. Zach, I always think your hedge fund magic keeps us relatively stable over short periods of time. I'm a little confused why three cuts now puts us down two versus up two last quarter. Zach Wasserman : Yeah, good question. I appreciate it. And I think what I\u2019ll just bring back to is the two key things here. Overall, the NIM outlook for us in both scenarios is a few basis points lower, mainly as a function of the timing of when rate reductions will begin and when we'll see substantive downgrade action. It's somewhat higher funding cost environment than we expected. And that's with the main driver. Second thing I would say is the four key factors for us that are driving the NIM this year remains the same. The biggest positive factor is fixed asset repricing, which I\u2019ve just shared in the prepared remarks, we expect to see about $4 billion quarterly repricing of fixed assets. We should drive substantive benefit on the order between 10 basis points and even 12 basis points or 13 basis points, depending on how the value of the curve maintains here over the course of this year. The second positive factor is a gradual reduction to the amount of hedge drag we've got in the NIM. In Q1, we had 16 basis points of hedge drag. And I expect to see something between 5 basis points to up to 8 basis points, to maybe even 10 basis points, again, depending on how the curve moves here over the course of the rest of this year until Q4. Those are the two biggest positive factors. The other two factors are what's going on with variable yields, and what's going on with funding costs. Those are largely offsetting each other in both of those moving off of a direct cost direction, to be clear, in either a higher rate path or a lower rate path scenario. And those are modestly net negative for the full year. It would offset those positives and keep these overall NIM in a generally flat to rising position from here. So none of that has really changed. The last thing I'll say, a third point, is that all of the modeling we're doing continues to indicate that a higher rate scenario overall, all things equal, drives a higher NIM for us. Clearly the -- how this plays out over such a short period of time, three quarters, will really depend on the shape and trajectory and timing and everything. But that's the best we can do. And I think the guidance we're trying to give here with this range of scenarios is designed to allow us to give you stability in terms of the revenue guidance, which ultimately is the most important thing. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. Zach, if we put all this together, you're saying NII bottomed in the first quarter. But I didn't hear you say NIM bottomed in the first quarter. Does that imply NIM has not bottomed in the first quarter? Zach Wasserman : I expect to see NIM bouncing around these levels, or rising over the course of the rest of the year, depending on how the scenario plays out. And for that, kind of flat to rising NIM, coupled with accelerating loan growth, to drive accelerating net interest income on a dollar basis out of the first quarter into the second quarter of growth and then continuing to grow into the third and the fourth quarter. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. Okay. If I just -- one separate question on the non-interest bearing deposits. Balance is down pretty sharp, average of period end, we're seeing some of your peers showing in February and March good stability in those balances. Did you guys see that as well? Or did you see balances decline through the quarter? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Balances were modestly declining through the quarter. As we look at that -- we see a few things. One is the trajectory of dollars of non-interest bearing actually decelerating in terms of their mix shift. Secondly, for the most part, all of the mix shift that we think will happen within consumer has happened. And where there is continued drift in Q1 is really in the business and commercial side. Another point would be we expect the non-interest-bearing mix shift, mix of the percentage to continue to stabilize in the high teens over the course of this year, which is 19.4% as of Q1. You know, and lastly I'll say, as you think about that percentage, it's very notable to measure that percentage if overall deposits are shrinking versus if they're growing. For us, overall deposits are growing strongly as we've said. So the mix is one thing, but the dollars are really the most important thing. In fact, we see stabilizing here over the course of the next couple of quarters. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Stephen Steinour : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess I just wanted to go back to something, Steve, you mentioned, I think in your prepared remarks, you said that the outlook in the economy is more conducive for growth. Your [indiscernible] probably the most upbeat, I've heard this over the last week. If you don't mind spending some time in terms of breaking down what you're seeing from customers in terms of strength and loan demand, looking into 2Q and beyond, and how much of this strength is just because of the proactive action Huntington has taken to hire bankers in Carolinas, Texas, would love some color around both those aspects. Thank you. Stephen Steinour : Thank you, Ebrahim. The economy, we all see the aggregate metrics that are released. There's an underlying strength. We're seeing that, particularly because we've been proactive with our lending activities through last year, the core is performing well. We're getting growth in our [auto book] [ph], our distribution finance in particular, our business bank, so very localized levels, principally here in the Midwest. We're also getting growth in a number of our other areas. And these new verticals that have been added, they've all closed the loans. They've all generated lending activity and other activity. And the Carolina expansion and Texas expansion are delivering results and look very promising to us. So we've positioned the bank both with the core activities and these incremental investments, I think, to outperform peers in loan growth and perhaps in a number of other respects as well, certainly through this year and potentially beyond. The pipeline activity I referenced earlier is very promising. And again, the strength of the first quarter with every month improving gives us a lot of confidence. Our investment banking activity, Capstone related, their pipeline is bigger than they've ever had, as an example. So we've got a lot of opportunity in front of us, so now we have to deliver it. Ebrahim Poonawala : That was helpful. And Zach, a couple of follow-ups for you. One, apologies on NII. I feel like I'm more confused after some of this back and forth. Should we expect if we don't get any rate cuts or maybe just one cut, NII tends towards up 2%. Is that the right takeaway? Zach Wasserman : It will really be a [technical difficulty] take there. So I think the outcome will be somewhere between that range of EV. When we give these ranges, we try to generally box our plan and land in the middle of it. But of course, there's a bit of variance and just normal variability that's hard to forecast with such decision. So that's the expectation. I think we'll see, as I noted, just to clarify, a flat to rising NIM, a slightly higher NIM in the higher rate scenario, albeit with different drivers, and really coupling that with accelerating loan growth will drive dollars out of the level we've seen in Q1, up into Q2 and beyond, and to land for a full year somewhere in the middle of that range. Ebrahim Poonawala : All right, so multiple scenarios, middle of the range. And any scenario where this could exceed that up 2%? Zach Wasserman : Certainly it's possible. We'll have to see how the rate environment plays out here. I think really at this point, we're probably parsing the precision more than is reasonable. It's still a pretty moving target in terms of where the yield curve is now, but I think we'll land somewhere in that range is our best estimate. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. And thanks for that incremental slide on the swaps detail. I'm wondering if you can just kind of help us understand as we get through the end of this year, both in terms of what that swaps impact looks like and as important, that fixed rate repricing, how should we think about those kind of combined benefits as we get out of \u201824 and think about \u201825? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yeah, it's a terrific question. Just maybe I'll say a few things on that. One is the fixed asset repricing benefit that we saw, and as mentioned earlier, somewhere between 10, 11, 12, 13 basis points outside this year from that $4 billion turning quarterly. Our modeling indicates that we\u2019ll continue on into 2025 at kind of a similar pace. It's really a very long-term phenomenon, and [indiscernible] significant support to the NIM as we get into 2025. On the hedge drag factor within NIM, that\u2019s 16 bps in Q1, reducing down by something like 5 basis points to 8 basis points, as much as 10, depending on the rate scenario, lower by the end of Q4. That should also continue on into the early part of 2025 as well. You probably get to about neutral position if there are some rate reductions. And if you just look at the rate curve, the forward rate curve, there is an expectation in the forward curve at this point that there will be, in fact, reductions either in the back half of this year, certainly into the early part of next year. And so if that comes to pass, then we'll see that 16 basis points sort of fully resolved by the middle of 2025. If there are great reductions, then you see less of that hedge drag coming back. But obviously, then \u2013 because there are different environment overall, regardless. The other thing I'll just say, you didn't ask it, but I'll share it is, if you look at the sum total of all of our hedging activities, which, as you know, are always designed to protect capital against up-rate scenarios, protect NIM in down-rate scenarios. That chart that I illustrated in the prepared remarks has a gradual shifting of that exposure as you get into and throughout 2025. The net result of that should be that by the end of 2025, asset sensitivity should be about one-third less. And so that's sort of the intent of that program, more broadly from an interest rate risk and asset sensitivity management perspective. Ken Usdin : Okay, cool, and then my follow-up, I'll just separate them. On just the fixed rate repricing, on the asset side, so we know about the meaningful help that you get this year, but then how did that layer in in terms of incremental fix rate benefit that happens into next year? Zach Wasserman : So, as I noted a bit ago, I think it's about the same benefit as we go out into 2025, and that's fairly similar churn of quarterly volumes, and continue to see the belly of the curve that's largely on those assets are priced, significantly higher than the historical rate of those assets. Over time, of course, you'll begin to see that benefit reduce on a sequential basis. At some point, it starts to [indiscernible] but likely not until the latter part of 2025, at the earliest at this point, based on how the curve is shaping up. Ken Usdin : Okay, my mistake, Zach. I didn't separate the two in your answer. My mistake. Zach Wasserman : No worries. Appreciate your question. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you touch a little bit on the fee income outlook and what you expect there? It seems like you're implying a bit of a step up in that based on what you saw in the first quarter, but talk a little bit about what you're seeing there. And then confidence in hitting that midpoint of the guide. Zach Wasserman : Q1 core fees grew by 3% year-over-year. And our guidance over the full year is between 5% and 7% on a full year. So that clearly implies we're going to see an acceleration of the income and an acceleration on the year-over-year basis, as we looked at this year, and high confidence to achieve that. The core drivers remain the same, as what we've discussed on many prior occasions. Capital markets, payments, and wealth management. You look at, sort of the trends we're seeing right now, what the performance was in the first quarter. Payments revenue is up 7% in the first quarter. Wealth revenue is up 10%. In capital markets, we saw commercial banking related revenues, around two-thirds of the capital markets activities that are really highly correlated to the pace and volume of commercial banking, that grew sequentially into the first quarter -- of the second sequential quarter of growth there. And I think one of the things that will power continued growth in capital markets from here is the fact that commercial loan production is likewise accelerating as Steve noted earlier. Advisory revenues were really beginning to recover well in the back half of 2023, but typically seasonally lower in Q1 for us in our focus in middle market advisory. We did see those advisor revenues lower into the first quarter. But likewise, our expectation for that is for continued expansion into the remaining part of this year. Pipelines look very good, very high quality, great firms that have contracted with us to look for M&A support. And so those are really the drivers from here. Payments continuing to perform, wealth continuing to execute the strategy, and then capital markets driving acceleration as well. And overall, continue to feel really good about landing somewhere in that full year\u2019s range. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good, helpful. I won't go back to net interest income, but I do want to ask about credit. Your numbers obviously look good, but anything you want to flag internally that you're seeing, and I'm curious also what you're seeing externally from a credit point of view. Thank you. Brendan Lawlor : Hey, this is Brendan. I'll take that one. As you sort of noted in your question, the story of the quarter is [indiscernible]. Across all of the credit metrics, pretty much in-line with where we reported either the fourth quarter or seasonally adjusted when you think about delinquencies, looking back at first quarter of last year, we're right in-line. And we feel really good about the position that we're sitting in right now. If there's the one place that everybody continues to focus on and talk about, and we're highly focused on it ourselves is office and the commercial real estate side. But as we've talked about in the past, we have one of the smaller books relative to our office portfolio. And we have a decent reserve against it. So while we're watching it and actively managing it, we feel very well protected against it at this point Stephen Steinour : Just to add to that, thanks Brendan. We've reduced the office portfolio by about $500 million over the course of the last four quarters. And our largest loan is $40 million. The average is $7 million-ish. So it's very granular, and it gets a lot of attention. And we expect it will continue to reduce throughout this year. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. If I can ask one more, I'm going to violate the one-in-one follow-up, but just bigger picture, there's been this myopic focus on the margin and net interest income. Do you guys -- do you feel incrementally better or worse about that plus or minus 2% guide? Because on one hand we're thinking about a lower margin in the very near-term and I get that, but it seems like it's higher funding costs to fund loan growth, which seems to be at the higher end of it. So I guess, the question is with some of these new developments do you feel better or worse about that higher or lower end of the net interest income guide? I think that would help people. Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Great question Jon. I'll take that one. [indiscernible] two statements I would make. First is, I feel really good about the overall performance of the business. For us, it's about executing long-term growth, long-term value creation. And Q1 set that up really well. We've seen confidence in loan growth accelerating, great core funding, and therefore the confidence in being within that range is very strong. At the margin, my revenue outlook is a touch lower than was the case before. But I think we're in the range of tuning at this point, Jon, and hence, not overly parse this -- somewhere in that range, typically try to land in the middle of the ranges that we're giving. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. All right, thank you, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live. Peter Winter : Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Jon's question just on credit. If I look at the ACL ratio, it's at the top end of the peers and credit is really holding in and you feel good about the economy. How are you thinking about reserving going forward? Is the plan to keep the ACL ratio fairly steady and just kind of support loan growth? Brendan Lawlor : Peter, it's Brendan. I'll take a chunk of that. You're noting the stability quarter-over-quarter, and that's accurate. I think, as we look forward, it's really fact specific as to how the ACL coverage will move quarter-over-quarter, as we take into account the modeling of our economic scenarios, the view of credit at that time, as well as the loan growth, as you referenced in your question. We put all of that into the mix to sort of drive out of our modeling what we believe the right level of coverage is. And so -- it's harder for us to, you know, for anybody frankly to -- in this environment, to really give any strong guidance, as to which way the ACL will move, as it's really a quarterly specific metric these days, and the way it's run. So it's hard for me to come out and say, well -- we think it'll do this, and we think it'll do that. Stephen Steinour : Okay. Peter, this is Steve. I'll just add to that. We've tried to be conservative with reserves over the years. We believe we're in that posture today and we expect to grow loans above peer this year and potentially beyond with the investments in these new businesses and regions we've made. And there's still a lot of uncertainty about where rates are going to go, when they\u2019re going to move, the geopolitical tension, the uncertainties that can spawn from elections, both ours and other countries. So we're just trying to be conservative at this stage. Should we continue to perform at the level we are, there will be reserve recapture at some point. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Just one quick follow-up. Just that comment that you're feeling better about loan growth. How much of the loan growth acceleration is new markets versus just core strength? And is part of that positive outlook, given the early success that you're seeing on the new initiatives? Zach Wasserman : This is Zach. I'll take that one. If you look at the full year loan growth outlook that we've got, it's between 3% and 5%. About 60% of that growth, we think will come from the core, and about 40% from these new organic expansion areas [Technical Difficulty]. And the mix of the overall company's growth will be weighted toward commercial, but consumer also growing pretty well. So that's the kind of broad answer in terms of the magnitude of them. And really, the other point is yes. The early traction is really very positive. We're seeing customers already being acquired, loans being booked, and the pipelines across all of the five new areas of focus for the three commercial verticals, Carolinas and Texas. The pipeline cumulatively is approaching $2 billion of loans, and also very significant deposit pipeline. Remember, these are tend to be full relationship strategies that are gathering loans, but also deposits, also fee income businesses in capital markets and payments and treasury management. So quite good early traction here. Obviously, starting from a low basis, Steve mentioned, so we're going to see that build here over the course of time. The last thing I'll say is, of those five, the most significant contributors in 2024, we expect to be the fund finance vertical in the Carolinas. Over time, the others will also be very significant, particularly Texas. But just in terms of the early momentum that we're seeing and based on when they started and were staffed, those two will be the most significant for 2014. Peter Winter : And just one last final. Does the core loan growth assume a pickup in-line utilization? Zach Wasserman : Not in substance. So if you think about the three big areas where we have outstanding lines in the broad middle market commercial lines, you saw that tick up just a tiny bit into the first quarter pretty flat, and it's not our expectation that that will change substantively from here. The second one being distribution finance. And that one we did see a benefit into the first quarter from -- and that was the typical seasonal pattern. We think that line generally now is stable level broadly. And we're just going to see the typical seasonal pattern. It's highest in the first quarter, it's lowest in the third quarter, just based on the kind of the cycles of inventory and sales. And then the last one is auto floor plan. We did see that also benefit us somewhat into the first quarter. But again, we think we're now at a point coming out of COVID, particularly in the auto floor plan business, where manufacturing has reached a stable level relative to sales, and we're going to see line utilization generally trending in a pretty consistent area from here in the floor plan business. So not counting on it really for the continued growth, although certainly benefiting from some seasonality in the first quarter. Stephen Steinour : And each of those businesses Zach referenced, we expect net increase in customers. So they'll have a core organic growth as primary driver. Peter Winter : Thanks. I appreciate all the color. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just from an industry point of view, are there any updates on the debit card interchange reform and remind us how meaningful that could be for you guys. And if any of -- it's incorporated in guidance, which I assume it's not. But any updates on that front? Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Yeah, good question Matt. Thanks. So the answer is no, broadly. No substantive update in terms of where that may be going. For us, we've got a really strong debit card franchise, it's one of the best in the country in terms of relative penetration and utilization within our consumer and small business base. So that's a real benefit to us. If you were to just run the numbers on the proposal as it was proposed, think it's around a $90 million annualized impact for us. With that being said, if history is a guide, often those proposals are changed substantively between the time they were initially put forth and when enacted, either to not come forth at all or to be substantively altered. So we'll see -- for us in our payment strategy, there's so much growth opportunity and so many opportunities to engage our customers that there will be, over time, ways to mitigate some of that and to certainly offset with other payments related to growth. As best we can tell at this point, to be fair, there is a proposal that would be at some point mid to latter part of \u201825 that will take effect. And so not in the guidance for \u201824 as you just noted. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Steve for any further closing comments. Stephen Steinour : So, in closing, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We're seeing momentum build across the bank, which will drive improved performance over the course of the year and beyond. We clearly expect our investments in our businesses to deliver growth this year and the future. The balance sheet is well positioned, ample capital and robust opportunities to support our growth initiatives. Our focus remains centered on driving core revenue growth, carefully managing expenses and growing loans consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Just as a reminder, the Board Executives, our colleagues, our top 10 shareholder collectively reflecting our strong line to build shareholder value. Finally, we would not be able to take care of our customers without the efforts of our nearly 20,000 exceptional colleagues engaged every day across the bank. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your questions and your interest in Huntington. And have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President, and CEO and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Brendan Lawlor, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our second quarter results, which Zach will detail later. These results are supported by our colleagues, who live our purpose every day as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive, and strengthen the communities we serve. Now, on to slide four. There are five key messages we want to share with you today. First, we are intensely focused on executing our organic growth strategies and leveraging our position of strength. Our robust liquidity and capital base put us in a position to drive growth, and we are investing in new geographies and businesses in addition to existing businesses. Second, we expanded net interest income, and we expected to continue to grow sequentially from the first quarter trough. This outlook is supported by accelerating loan growth and sustained deposit growth to power future revenue expansion. Third, we drove fee revenues higher in the quarter with support from our three major focus areas : capital markets, payments, and wealth management. Fourth, we are achieving strong credit performance with stable net charge-offs, which are tracking as expected for the year. This is a direct result of our sustained and disciplined approach to credit over many years and our aggregate moderate to low-risk appetite. Finally, we believe the net result of these actions will deliver expanded profitability from here and into 2025 and beyond. I will move us on to slide five to recap our performance. We delivered accelerated loan growth with average balances growing by $2 billion from a year ago. Annualized loan growth in the quarter was 4.7%. Average deposit balances also increased, growing $8 billion or 5.5% over the past year. Capital further strengthened with reported common equity Tier 1 of 10.4% and adjusted common equity Tier 1 of 8.6%, inclusive of AOCI. Liquidity remains top tier with coverage of uninsured deposits of 204%, a peer-leading level. Credit quality was stable as net charge-offs improved by 1 basis point from the first quarter to 29 basis points. We are sustaining momentum in the growth of our primary bank relationships, with consumer and business increasing by 2% and 4%, respectively year-over-year. Again, this past quarter, we seized the opportunity to add talented bankers. We're pleased to add new deposit-focused capabilities in the mortgage servicing and homeowners association, title, and escrow areas. These new teams build upon the prior investments we've made in the Carolinas, Texas, and three new specialty commercial verticals. As we shared last month, we are bringing in-house our merchant acquiring business within our payments organization to further accelerate revenues and capabilities. As I mentioned, our disciplined positioning of robust capital and liquidity enables our ability to sustain a growth posture. Capital continues to increase, with adjusted CET1 up approximately 50 basis points from a year ago. Liquidity continues to be robust, supported by sustained deposit gathering. We were pleased to once again deliver top quartile results in this year's CCAR stress test exercise with Huntington\u2019s modeled credit losses second best in the peer group. Our stress capital buffer was reduced and came in at the minimum level of 2.5%. Across our markets, we see the broader economy continuing to hold up. Our new initiatives, teams, and geographies provide growth opportunities, even as the broader environment for customer loan demand remains somewhat muted. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide six provides highlights of our second quarter results. We reported earnings per common share of $0.30. The quarter included a $6 million notable item related to the updated FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Special Assessment. This did not have an impact on EPS. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE, came in at 16.1% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 16.2%. Average loan balances increased by $2 billion or 1.7%, versus Q2 last year. Average deposits continued to grow, increasing by $8 billion, or 5.5%, on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality remains strong, with net charge-offs of 29 basis points. Allowance for credit losses decreased by 2 basis points and ended the quarter at 1.95%. Adjusted CET1 ended the quarter at 8.6% and increased roughly 10 basis points from last quarter. Supported by earnings, tangible book value per share has increased by nearly 8% year-over-year. Turning to slide seven, consistent with our plan and prior guidance, loan growth is accelerating quarter-over-quarter. Our sequential growth in loans into Q2 of $1.5 billion was more than double the sequential dollar growth into the first quarter. This likewise drove acceleration of loan growth on a year-over-year basis from 1.2% in Q1 to 1.7% in Q2. At our current run rate of growth 4.7% annualized, we are on track for the full-year plan. We expect the pace of future year-over-year loan growth to accelerate over the course of 2024. Loan growth in the quarter was supported by both commercial and consumer loan categories. Total commercial loans increased by $689 million. Excluding commercial real estate, commercial growth totaled $1.1 billion for the quarter. Over the past year, CRE balances have declined by $1.3 billion, with the concentration of CRE as a percent of total loans declining 1.5 percentage points from 10.9% to 9.6% today. Even as we have managed CRE balances lower, all other loan balances have increased by over $4 billion or 4% from the prior year. Drivers of commercial loan growth in the second quarter included $600 million from new geographies and specialty verticals. This included fund finance, Carolinas, Texas, healthcare asset-based lending and Native American financial services. Auto floor plan increased by $279 million. Regional and business banking increased by $233 million. In total consumer loans, average balances grew by $757 million or 1.4% for the quarter. Within consumer, average auto balances increased by $436 million. Residential mortgage increased by $199 million, benefiting from production, as well as slower prepay speeds. RV and marine balances increased by $74 million. Turning to slide eight. As noted, we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth. Average deposits increased by $2.9 billion or 1.9% in the second quarter. Total cumulative deposit beta was 45%. Cost of deposits increased by 9 basis points in the second quarter, which matched the increase in earning asset yields. This was half the rate of change in deposit costs we saw into the first quarter, a continuation of the decelerating trends in funding costs even as deposit growth increased. Within the quarter, there was notable further deceleration with June deposit costs only slightly higher than May. We are actively implementing our down beta action plan, which is further supported by the robust deposit growth we have delivered. This position is allowing us to selectively reduce rates and change other terms across the portfolio in advance of potential rate cuts later this year. Turning to slide nine. Our cumulative deposit growth since the start of the rate cycle of 7.9% is differentiated versus the preponderance of peers. We have outperformed by double-digit percentage points on deposit growth over this time. As a result, we've been able to fund loan growth with deposits, and at the same time, manage the loan to deposit ratio lower over the past year, which will support continued acceleration of lending. Turning to slide 10. Non-interest bearing mix shift is tracking closely to our forecast. Average non-interest-bearing balances decreased by $280 million or 0.9% from the prior quarter. This represents a continued deceleration of mix shift, consistent with our expectations. Within the consumer deposit base, average non-interest-bearing deposits were modestly higher quarter-over-quarter. This was offset by a modest decelerating trend of lower non-interest-bearing balances from commercial depositors. On to slide 11. For the quarter, net interest income increased by $25 million or 1.9% to $1,325 million. We are pleased to have delivered growth off the trough levels from last quarter and believe this inflection in revenues will continue into the third and fourth quarters. Net interest margin was 2.99% for the second quarter. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q1, we saw a decrease of 2 basis points. This was due to higher cash balances, with spread net of free funds flat versus the prior quarter. We continue to benefit from fixed-rate loan repricing with loan yields expanding by 9 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios for both short term rates as well as the slope and belly of the curve. Our working assumption for the second half of the year is aligned with a forward curve, which projects two rate cuts by year-end. Based on that outlook, we see net interest margin relatively stable over the next two quarters at or around the 3% level, plus or minus a few basis points. Turning to slide 12. Our level of cash and securities increased, as we benefited from higher funding balances from sustained deposit growth. We expect cash and securities as a percent of total average assets to remain approximately 28% as the balance sheet grows over time. We are reinvesting securities cash flows in short duration HQLA, consistent with our approach to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio at approximately the current range. Turning to slide 13. As a reminder, our hedging program is designed with two primary objectives, to protect margin and revenue in down rate environments, and to protect capital in potential up rate scenarios. As of June 30, our effective hedge position included $17.4 billion of received fixed swaps, $5.5 billion of floor spreads, and $10.7 billion of pay fixed swaps. The pay fixed swaps, which successfully protected capital, have a weighted average life of just over three years and will begin to mature over the course of 2025. As these instruments mature, our asset sensitivity will reduce. Furthermore, at a measured pace over the past several quarters, we have added more forward-starting receive fix swaps, with effective dates starting generally in the first-half of 2025. The impact of both the maturities of the pay fix swaps and the beginning effectiveness of the receive fix swaps will reduce asset sensitivity in a down rate scenario by approximately one-third by the middle of next year. As always, we will continue to dynamically manage our hedging program to achieve our objectives of capital protection and NIM stabilization. Moving on to slide 14, our fee revenue growth is driven by three substantive areas, capital markets, payments, and wealth management. Collectively, these three areas represent nearly two-thirds of our total fee revenues. Within capital markets, revenues increased $17 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher advisory revenues. Commercial banking-related capital markets revenues were stable quarter-to-quarter. We expect to sustain and build upon this level over the back half of the year, supported by robust advisory pipelines in Capstone, as well as expected new commercial loan production. Payments in cash management revenue was up $8 million in the second quarter and increased 5% year-over-year. Treasury management fees within payments continue to grow strongly at 11% year-over-year as we deepen customer penetration. Our wealth and asset management revenues increased 8% from the prior year. Advisory relationships have increased by 8% year-over-year, and assets under management have increased by 17% on a year-over-year basis. Moving on to slide 15. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income increased by $24 million to $491 million for the second quarter, increasing from the seasonal first quarter low. Excluding the impacts of the CRT transactions, non-interest income increased by $31 million, quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to slide 16 on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense decreased by $20 million, and underlying core expenses increased by $13 million. During the quarter, we incurred $6 million of incremental expense related to the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Special Assessment. Excluding this item, core expenses came in better than our expectations for the quarter, with approximately half of the lower-than-expected result driven by discrete benefits not expected to occur. The increase in core expenses quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by personnel expenses, as we saw higher revenue-driven compensation and incentives due to production, as well as the full quarter impact of merit increases effective in March. We continue to forecast 4.5% core expense growth for the full-year. As we look into the third quarter, we expect core expenses to be higher at approximately $1.140 billion. There may be some variability given revenue-driven compensation. Slide 17 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.4%. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI, was 8.6% and has grown 50 basis points from a year ago. Our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher, while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth. We intend to drive adjusted CET1, inclusive of AOCI, into our operating range of 9% to 10%. Slide 18 highlights our results from this year's CCAR exercise. We were pleased to once again continue our trend of top quartile performance for expected credit losses from the stress test. This year's result was second best, compared to peers. Our SCB improved to the 2.5% minimum, and our modeled stress CET1 ratio was the second best in our peer group. Our ACL, as a percentage of CCAR modeled losses, continued to be the highest level, compared to our peers. These results validate the consistency of our long-standing approach to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. On slide 19, credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 29 basis points in Q2, 1 basis point lower than the prior quarter. They remain in the lower half of our through-the-cycle target range of 25 to 45 basis points. Allowance for credit losses at 1.95% declined by 2 basis points from the prior quarter, effectively flat and reflects both modestly improved economic outlook, as well as an increased loan portfolio. On slide 20, the criticized asset ratio declined 7% from the prior quarter, driven by broad-based improvements across commercial portfolios. Non-performing assets increased approximately 5% from the previous quarter to 63 basis points, while remaining below the prior 2021 level. Turning to Slide 21. Our outlook for the full-year remains unchanged from our prior guidance. As we discussed, we expect loan growth to accelerate and deposit growth to sustain its quarterly trend. We drove net interest income higher from its trough and expect that trend to continue sequentially in the second-half. Core expenses are well-managed and tracking to our full-year outlook, subject to some variability, given revenue-driven compensation levels and the timing of staffing adds and expenses related to the insourcing of our merchant acquiring business. We expect to exit the year at a low single-digit year-over-year growth rate. Credit is performing well, aligned with our expectations. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move over to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person asks only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Well, thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. Steve Steinour : Morning, Manan. Manan Gosalia : Zach, can you expand on your comments on how you're managing downside deposit beta if we get a couple of rate cuts by year-end? I think in the past, you've spoken about a downside beta of 20% or so on total deposits. Can that be a little bit better given that you've been more competitive on deposits in the first half of the year? Steve Steinour : Yes. Thanks, Manan. Good morning. A great question. Appreciate the chance to elaborate on this one. Well, as I noted in the prepared remarks, we're already beginning the early stages of the down beta playbook. I think reducing acquisition rates, shifting the acquisition mix from time deposits toward more money market, which is easier and faster to manage on a down beta trajectory, shortening the duration of CDs and making targeted rate reductions in certain client segments. So already beginning these actions and they've benefited us in the second quarter. As we look forward, clearly, the performance and trajectory of our beta will be a function of what not only the core yield curve projects, but importantly what clients in the markets generally believe to be the rate environment. With that being said, what we're seeing set up now is very conducive to continuing this action, being ready to actually implement the full down beta playbook when we presumably see a rate reduction later this year. So there's good confidence in where things are going in terms of that. It's a little early to give precise guidance here because clearly the trajectory on beta over the course of the first year. So it will be a function of those market expectations. But it's our general working assumption that we'll be in the mid to high-20s percent down beta range over a kind of first year period and then continuing from there. And as I said, sort of shaping up pretty well here in the early days a bit. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then maybe on the loan side, can you talk about how spreads are tracking? We've had several banks highlighting weaker demand on loan growth, but they're all looking for loan growth. So are you seeing things getting more competitive and does -- how is that impacting loan spreads overall? Steve Steinour : No. Look, it is certainly a competitive environment. And we're driving growth, as we said, into the second quarter. On a dollar basis, we saw double the growth into the second quarter than we saw in the first quarter. So the acceleration that we have been calling for some time we're seeing. And so we feel pretty pleased about that. Part of the question on loan spreads for us overall on a net basis is where are we growing, what segments, what categories are we growing in. And where we're focused is driving growth in a lot of the new areas we've been investing in, which typically come on with pretty attractive spreads relative to the average. I would characterize the spread environment generally as pretty flat on a product and category level. And for us, we're really focused on trying to drive capital optimization, obviously, in the areas with the highest return that often have good spreads, but it could also come with fee business performance as well. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Steve Steinour : Morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : [Technical Difficulty] talk through expected deposit trends for the rest of the quarter. Clearly, you have outpaced, as you mentioned, back to preponderance of your peers at the through-the- cycle in terms of deposit growth. I guess I got the impression that perhaps some of this deposit growth is prefunding even better loan growth for the second half of the year. And I did notice that you could get through your securities portfolio and at that rate that you mentioned that like a good move relative to the curve? But I'm just wondering, I guess the question here is, can you continue to -- do you have enough deposits to fund the acceleration [Technical Difficulty] that we've been waiting for or are you expecting to continue to grow at this pace, but closer to the rate and competitive dynamics that you observed in June? In other words, it won't be as expensive plus 9 basis points for the quarter. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Erika for the question. This is Zach. I'll take it. Your line was clipping a little bit as I went over. But I think what I heard was what is our expectation for loan growth and kind of deposit price -- sorry, deposit growth, I'm sorry, and deposit pricing here in the back half of the year and will we have enough to fund loans going forward and what the kind of rate trajectory is around that. So let me see if I can address that. And if I haven't covered it, you can follow-up. Look, I think we're really pleased with how things are going on deposit gathering, for sure. If you take a big step back, 15% outperformance versus the peer median over the course of the rate cycle with a beta that compares pretty favorably to both history and peer. So really doing well. I think what that's allowing us to do is, to your question, prefund to some degree our future loan growth that we've seen the loan to deposit ratio just the last year go from 84% this time last year to 81% now the quarter we disclosed. So sort of sets up that ability to fund with core deposits, decelerating loan growth that we expect. But also I would note and it sort of goes back to Manan's question a second ago, it gives us a lot of flexibility to really manage down beta and to be selective and disciplined in terms of where that next unit of funding will come from. And so that is sort of the intention and we've been performing really well. So I mean, to some degree, I will share that we're actually outperforming our initial budget on deposit growth, is one of the reasons why we elevated the deposit growth forecast up to the high end of our initial guidance range. I think we saw extraordinary level of growth into the second quarter, almost $3 billion. I don't expect that same level of sequential growth into the second quarter, but I do expect it to grow and I would see some nice sequential growth into the fourth quarter too, and to be within that overall guidance range of 3 to 4 for the full-year. So I think that will allow us to kind of absorb the increased lending volumes that we're projecting and core fund them and set up the ability to manage down beta. In terms of pricing strategy, we'll sort of go back a little bit to the answer I gave to Manan, which is we're being judicious. We're still in acquisition mode, but we're very much cognizant that we are in a position of strength and that can allow us to execute the early stages of down beta. So we're seeing it in the marketplace, reductions in go-to-market acquisition pricing. We're likewise doing that and taking that opportunity. And I believe that if we do get rate reductions here in September, which just seems to be a certainty based on the market expectations, we'll be able to continue that and to drive it forward even further. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And just as a follow-up question to that, as I try to put together everything that you told us about deposit pricing trends, continued fixed-rate asset repricing and the swaps that are maturing, while you started the year having a generally asset sensitive position, the way your balance sheet will evolve into next year, it sounds like -- in terms of both strategically in pricing and mechanically in terms of some of the financial engineering rolling off, you will be set up to potentially benefit from that rate curve or lower short range. Steve Steinour : Yes, great, question. So let me sort of address some of the thinking around NIM trajectory, asset sensitivity plans. But the objective we've had vis-a-vis asset sensitivity management over the last year, year and a half even has been to allow our natural asset sensitivity to really maximize the value of the up rate environment, which works pretty well. Clearly, now as we think about rates topping out and then presumably beginning to fall, where we are strategically reducing asset sensitivity. And in the prepared remarks, I highlighted that the combination of increasing forward-starting received fixed swaps and expiration of pay fixed swaps will reduce asset sensitivity by about a third between now and the end of -- I'm sorry, the middle of next year. And we'll continue to be dynamic in managing that, but that's a very intentional reduction in asset sensitivity to manage in the presence of reduced trades. I think on NIM, generally seeing pretty stable trends here over the next several quarters. And there are two substantive positive factors we've discussed over time. Fixed asset repricing will continue to benefit the NIM. We -- second factor hedge drag, about 16 basis points of net hedge drag in the second quarter that we just closed. So that will go down to almost a neutral position by the middle of next year in an implied forward scenario. So we'll get some benefits from that pretty steadily here over the next several quarters. The other two factors that are very rate path-dependent, clearly are what happens with variable yields, what happens with interest-bearing liability costs. But in our expectation, you'll see an accelerating and an effective down beta that will help to mitigate variable yield reductions. And the net of those things will be a pretty flat NIM here. But I think over the longer term, we do see certainly the opportunities to drive NIM higher in a more upwards curve -- upward sloping yield curve environment. And so, that is I think what the market is expecting. So we're pretty positive about where NIM will go over the longer-term after we get through this initial stages of that rate. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Alexopoulos : Hey, good morning, everyone. Steve Steinour : Morning, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : I want to start -- maybe Zach for you. So if we do get two cuts this year, say, September, December. Zach, what's your bias as it relates to the NII outlook, the down 1 to down 4? Where in the range do you think we lean? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question. So we -- our practice in terms of setting these ranges is try to box where we think our basic trend is going. So we're generally trending pretty well, though, in that range, and that's including a couple of cuts there. I do think that a lot of -- one of the key factors in managing a flat NIM will be that continued execution on reducing the trajectory of interest rate cuts rising and then begin to driving them lower. And of course, the real ability to do that is a function of what the competitive environment is and what customers believe the rate path is. And so it will be dependent on the conviction of the market and the economy broadly where our rates are going. But with that being said, the data does continue to set up pretty good confidence around where the yield curve will go. And so feel pretty good about our ability to do that. So the other element of it clearly is loan growth. And we're seeing really encouraging signs there. Pipelines look strong, solid performance in Q2, expects to continue to grow and accelerate on a year-over-year basis here in the back half of the year. I think we could see even faster loan growth if some of our new growth initiatives perform even well -- even better than they're forecasted to do in our base plan. The pipelines there look really good. And so, the pull through is even better. Based on our base plan, we see some upward bias on loan growth. Likewise, what we haven't addressed in the Q&A section here is we did see more CRE run-off in the second quarter than we had expected at the kind of initial budgeting. To the extent that that is lower going forward, you can see some higher loan volumes and that could lift revenues above the base plan. Conversely, if any of those factors were worse, that could take it to the lower end. But feel pretty good about trending right in the middle of that range at this point, Steven. Steven Alexopoulos : So middle of the range, is that what you said? Zach Wasserman : That's the baseline. Steven Alexopoulos : That's your baseline. Okay, that's helpful. And then it's funny when you look at slide seven, you're calling out the $600 million, that was the increase in average loans from new initiatives, right, I don't know, call it, $2.5 billion a year. And I'm curious, because you could look at that and say, well, that's sort of a catch-up, you have new bankers and new verticals bring over their books, but then you're saying momentum is building. So when we look out from here, we think about that $2.5 billion run rate or so, do you see upside to that? As the quarters roll forward, should we see more contribution from new initiatives in a dollar perspective? Steve Steinour : I think I'm expecting to see very strong performance in these new initiatives. We're really pleased with how they're doing. Every one of them has booked customers, is booking loans. We're seeing good performance on the full relationship in terms of deposits and fees starting to come through. So really pleased with it. And I also wouldn't characterize it necessarily as them bringing their books over. These were talented bankers with deep experience in their industries and those geographies we've launched in and we're just sort of driving through new client acquisition on a pretty core basis. The trajectory of growth that you highlighted, I expect to see a pretty steady build from here. I don't know that I'd see acceleration per se, but the trajectory we're on is already very accretive to loan growth. Steven Alexopoulos : Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. So I think my question is on customer -- overall customer demand on loans have sort of been answered. But I was hoping you could maybe address auto in particular. I noticed production is as high as it's been in the last several years. Is that sort of maybe being used as a flex, given sort of the softer overall growth than you had anticipated maybe earlier this year and -- albeit within the context of -- it sounds like things outside of that category are going to advance more robustly later on. So just curious how you're thinking about auto. And then as the follow-up, maybe just sort of quality of that portfolio given what the kind of fluctuations we've seen in used car values, lower economy, et cetera. Steve Steinour : Scott, this is Steve. I'll take the question. And our auto business has performed very well this year and in the second quarter, we expect it will continue. We don't -- we're not using it as a buffer. I think that was essentially what you were asking. We just see it as a terrific opportunity. Some of the other banks in the last year or so pulled back on auto. It's created a bit of an opportunity for us and we'd expect to continue generating significant volume and growth. As you saw at the CLM, and as we've done in the past with auto securitization, we'll manage aggregate exposure with the book, but we've got quite a bit of work at this point. In terms of quality of the book, it's a super prime book. And so very low default, and we've talked about this for years. We focus on default frequency. On the margin, the used car pricing can have a slight impact on incremental loss or avoided loss, but -- on each repossession, but it's not going to be a big number for us either way. We've shown that this book performs very well over the years, we expect it will continue to do so. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then Zach, maybe one for you just on costs. I appreciate the sort of the third quarter rise, but then it sounds like we're still all on track for the full year. In the past, and I don't want to get too detailed on next year, but you've sort of talked about that normalization of overall cost growth into next year. Any change, sort of, broadly to how you're thinking about that? Or are we still sort of on track for that as well? Zach Wasserman : On track for that is the headline answer there. I feel really good about how we're managing expenses for the year. There's clearly been a little bit of timing delta from where we would have initially expected to where we are now, but the full-year looks quite in line where we would have thought initially and in line with our guidance. What that will set up is, as we've discussed on previous calls, a steady deceleration in the rate of year-over-year growth as we go throughout the course of this year. I think expense growth last quarter was about 5% year-over-year. This is like around 6%, I think, effectively in Q2 we disclosed. That will trend toward low-single-digits by the time we get to the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. And our expectation we'll see that -- run that trend down into 2025. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you for taking the questions. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, Zach, I'm not sure if I've missed it. Just talk to us around the loan to deposit ratio, 80%. Do you expect that to stay as is? The guidance kind of implies that. But as we think about all this loan growth coming up, should we expect the loan to deposit ratio to stay flat, like that's where the Bank is going to be managed? And talk to us also about the mix of these deposits that are coming in, if you can talk about like blended rates or what the NIB mix of these deposits is, that would be helpful. Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes, great question. I think that we're really pleased with how we're doing on deposit gathering and to some degree just prefunding loan growth that we're expecting to continue to drive higher here over time. And so, I'd expect over the course of a longer time period, likely see the loan to deposit ratio drift back higher again, but stay within a pretty tight range. The objective we've got on average over time is to grow our deposits at a very similar rate to loans, and the delta would only be kind of temporary as we see trends on a relatively short-term basis might be to diverge. So over the back half of this year, I'm expecting to see maybe slightly faster sequential loan growth than deposit growth, but not so meaningful as to probably shift that ratio very much. Fundamentally, what we're seeing in terms of deposit growth is the same function we've been seeing for the last several quarters. Underlying acquisition of new relationships is quite good. We talked about 2% primary bank household growth in consumer, 4% in business bank, commercial also growing a lot of new names and new customers, particularly given our new growth initiatives. And also importantly, a couple of the new verticals we've added, very much focused on deposit gathering, which is very much helpful. The mix of it, as I noted in one of the earlier questions, is actively shifting out of more time into more money market, that sort of value driver from here, which will help us set up the ability to move beta down at a faster rate going forward. And all that's going to contribute to just that sort of slow progression of topping out deposit costs and then bringing them back down in that decelerating way on the up and then accelerating on the way down as we've discussed. That's sort of what we're seeing at this point. In terms of non-interest bearing, I don't think I've gotten the question as yet, but I think in the materials, you can see the chart where that's going. We're seeing a meaningful deceleration of that mix shift out of non-interest bearing into the first quarter, that will give you a sense from the fourth quarter, $1.3 billion reduction in non-interest bearing into the -- second quarter, we disclosed only $300 million of reduction in non-interest bearing. And in fact, consumer went up. So we think we're almost done here in terms of mix shift out of non-interest bearing and this will last until -- here in the near-term. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess, just one quick follow-up. You mentioned expenses, we'll do low-single digits, if I heard you correctly, by the end of the year. Does that -- should we be reading into that in terms of '25 expense growth being higher, lower, or same as '24? Zach Wasserman : So the thing with -- great question again. The point we've been discussing, I think for a while in terms of expense growth, this year 4.5%, was intentionally higher than what we otherwise were kind of running at, so that we could invest in some of these new growth initiatives and also importantly, invest a lot of data and automation capabilities throughout the company. But that pace of growth would reduce as we went into 2025. And that is our plan. I expect to see lower growth rate of expenses in 2025 than I saw in 20 -- than we're seeing in 2024. And the sort of the trend is very much supportive of that, because by the time we'll exit this year, we'll already be exiting at a kind of run rate of year-over-year growth that's quite low. So try to maintain that lower growth rate as we go into '25. Steve Steinour : Ebrahim, Zach has shared in the past, efforts to lower growth rates in core expense levels of the Bank in order to continue to invest in different opportunities, revenue-producing opportunities primarily. You should expect to see that from us in '25 and beyond as well. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thanks, Stephen and Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thank you, Ebrahim. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping\u2026 Steve Steinour : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: I was hoping you guys could talk about the risk transfers that you guys have executed on. Just there's been some coverage about it, what you've done and some others in the media. And, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out the logic. I mean, you've got strong capital, you're building capital. I realize you've got kind of the strong loan growth outlook. But the rate that was kind of put out there in the media seems pretty high for what's a very high-quality auto book as you show in the slides here. So just trying to understand kind of the logic about it and the cost to the media is like 7.5%. So anything around the logic and financial impact? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes, great question. This is Zach. I'll take that one. If you take a step back and look at our capital plans, and put these transactions in the context of the overall capital plan, the plan is really twofold. Drive adjusted CET1 higher. We were 8.6% adjusted CET1 in the second quarter. We intend to drive that up into our operating range of 9% to 10%. I think we're just a handful of quarters away from achieving that, our current trajectory. And then the second key objective is fund high-return loan growth, and we're doing that. And I think as we said that will continue and accelerate on a year-over-year basis. And the prime driver of creating the capital to support those objectives is organic earnings and the core earnings power of the company. And that really is the core focus, the prime focus. With that being said, and just shifting now to your question on CRT and CLNs, at the margin, these transactions can be very helpful for just further RWA and balance sheet optimization. And so, we're pleased to do a [CDS] (ph) transaction in the fourth quarter of last year and then a very successful credit-linked-note transaction in the second quarter. To give you a sense of the economics, the second quarter yield was exceptionally good. Less than a 3% cost of capital. So what do I mean by that? $4 billion notional transaction against high-quality indirect auto loans, 74% reduction in risk-weighted assets through the transaction, so $3 billion reduction in RWA. We also get almost $500 million of funding from the transaction. And the cost of that is only $7 million into spread on a year-one basis, plus some modest upfront transaction costs. So it's incredibly efficient at the margins, unlocked 17 bps of CET1, and just continue to support those prime objectives. So we look at it as very much tactical. It's not the core underlying driver, but just these opportunistic things that come through, and really pleased with how well [Technical Difficulty] economics are incredibly favorable. Matt O'Connor: Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Maybe a question for you, Steve. How far out do you have visibility on loan growth? I'm just -- I'm thinking a little bit more about the exit rate for NII in 2024. I'm just curious how you're thinking beyond the next quarter or two. Steve Steinour : Well, our pipelines go out a couple of quarters. And so, we have visibility through -- not full visibility, but partial visibility through the fourth quarter. We don't yet have significant visibility into '25. Certain businesses, though, because of the nature of their relationships, our distribution finance, we tie back into to the supply base and we get some insight from them as to what they intend to produce. But on the whole, we don't have significant multi-quarter visibility, Jon. But we do see from our customer base, however, they're performing well this year. I think there's an expectation as rates come down that they'll be doing more -- even more business next year. And that's a general sentiment they sort of share with you. Jon Arfstrom : Yes. Okay, that's helpful. And I guess this hasn't been touched on, but anything to note on credit, anything you're seeing that's bothering you, anything that's surprising you positively? Thank you. Steve Steinour : So credit continues to perform very well. We're very pleased with performance year-to-date. The outlook looks good. As you know, we spent a lot of time on portfolio reviews and management and it's looking good. So there'll be some lumpiness in commercial real estate over the next couple of years for us and others in the industry. But outside of that are looking good. And on the whole, for us, it's not going to be an issue. As you know, our CRE concentration continues to reduce. So I think we had a little over $250 million of office payouts over the last six quarters. The hack with construction unused commitments have been absorbed. So books in -- the CRE book's in good shape. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Peter Winter : Hi. Good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : You guys had a -- good morning. You guys had a nice rebound in fee income. And then you've got the merchant acquiring coming on back in-house, starting in the third-quarter, which I think adds about $6 million to fees. Just do you think fee income that you can continue with this momentum and kind of maybe come in at the upper end of that 5% to 7% range? Zach Wasserman : Thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll take that one. So would share your -- the other line of [Technical Difficulty] your question was fee income performance was very strong. We were really pleased with what we saw. Second quarter was up 6% sequentially from the first. Continue to run at a 5% year-over-year growth rate, similar to the first quarter year-over-year. And our expectation is to land within our 5% to 7% full-year range. And as we get into the back half of the year, and we've got some of the grow-overs versus last year, get a little easier. With that being said, I think we'll continue to power sequential growth here and it really is the three priority areas of focus; capital markets, payments, and wealth management. Execution quality is very strong and the trends we're seeing continue to be very much conducive to that. The payments up 5% year-over-year in Q2. Treasury management is within that double-digit growth, driven by client penetration. Wealth management continues to run at very strong levels. Our performance advisory, households up 8. AUM and net flows look really good and that's driving revenue up 8%. And capital markets, which clearly has been a little bit choppy in the back half of last year, we were pleased to see what we would expect, which was strong growth in the second quarter, particularly in our advisory business, where we know that the middle-market M&A has been in a challenging environment as yields were -- as interest rate environment was rising last year, that activity is now picking up and I think will sustain. So I'm expecting sequential growth in each of those areas. I think where we land in the range will be clearly a function of how well we perform in it, but strong confidence we'll get there. Peter Winter : Okay. And then just -- last question just on credit. I mean, as you talked about, credit trends are really good. If I look at the ACL ratio, you're at the top end of peers. Just how are you thinking about reserving going forward? Is it kind of like keep the ACL ratio fairly steady at current levels and support loan growth? And I guess what do you need to see to start lowering the ACL ratio? Brendan Lawlor : Hey, Peter, it's Brendan. Excuse me, I'll take that one. As you sort of noted, we basically had the reserve flat this quarter at 1.95 versus 1.97 last quarter as the models add to the dollar amount of the reserve. We just continue to watch the volatility in just the overall market, but particularly with respect to rates, as well as the impact of higher prolonger rates on our commercial real estate portfolio. So, excuse me, as we see stronger economic performance come through in our modeling, and combined with the continued solid performance of the credit portfolio, that's when we would really look to start to move the reserve down more materially. That will be -- play out over a longer period of time. And so we're just -- we're continuing to watch and manage this to the right level, but right now we feel like we're adequately reserved. Peter Winter : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Well, thank you for joining us today. In closing, we're pleased with our second quarter results, having delivered sequential growth in both spread and fee revenues. We're expecting our organic growth strategies and our investments are bearing fruit with momentum building across the Bank. Our competitive position remains strong with robust capital liquidity. We continue to seize the opportunities to add talented bankers across our businesses. We remain focused on our long-term strategic objectives. And collectively, the Board, executives and our colleagues are a top 10 shareholder. We have a strong alignment of delivering meaningful value for our shareholders. Finally, special thank you to our nearly 20,000 colleagues here at the Bank who support our customers every day and are the backbone of these results. Thank you for your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer. Brendan Lawlor, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We are very pleased to report outstanding results for the third quarter, which Zach will detail later. 2024 continues to be a dynamic year and our year-to-date results demonstrate Huntington's strength and consistent performance. These strong results reflect the dedication of our nearly 20,000 colleagues across the bank who live our purpose every day as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive, and strengthen the communities we serve. Now on to Slide 4. There are five key messages we want to share with you today. First, we are driving accelerated loan growth along with sustained deposit growth. These results are supported by our core businesses, as well as the successful execution of new initiatives, including expanded geographies and commercial banking verticals. Second, we are actively executing our down beta playbook as the market enters a declining Fed rate cycle. We are dynamically managing the balance sheet and coupled with our growth outlook, we expect to deliver record net interest income in 2025. Third, we continue to drive fee revenues higher with sustained momentum across our three major focus areas : payments, wealth management, and capital markets. Fourth, our credit performance remained strong during the quarter with stable net charge-offs as well as lower non-performing and criticized assets. This is a direct result of our consistent disciplined credit management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Finally, our performance during the quarter set the foundation for continued organic growth and increased profitability into 2025 and beyond. I will move us on to Slide 5 to recap our performance. We delivered accelerated loan growth in the quarter with average balances growing by 3% from a year-ago. End-of-period loans increased at a 6.3% annualized rate. Average deposit growth continued at a robust pace increasing by $8.3 billion or 5.6% over the past year. We drove capital ratios higher again with adjusted common equity Tier-1 of 8.9%. This benefited both from capital accretion from earnings as well as reduced AOCI. Our fee revenue strategies are delivering with GAAP fee income increasing by 3% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, core fee revenues demonstrated robust growth increasing by 12% from a year-ago, driven by payments, wealth management, and capital markets. We are sustaining momentum in the growth of primary bank customer relationships. As we continue to acquire new customers across the footprint, consumer PBRs have increased by 2% and business banking PBRs have increased by 4% year-over-year. We have delivered PBR growth consistently with year-over-year increases for over a dozen consecutive quarters. We have continued to invest across the company to drive sustained organic growth. Last month, we were pleased to announce our full franchise and branch expansion into the Carolinas. This builds upon the success of our earlier investments in the commercial and regional banking teams over the past year. These markets represent some of the most attractive geographies nationally given their size and growth characteristics. We've hired well-established colleagues with local expertise in these markets and the results today are tracking much better than our initial business case. We've also invested substantially in our payments businesses, particularly in treasury management, including bringing in-house our merchant acquiring capabilities. The merchant acquiring business completed its final testing phase in September and implemented its full commercial launch in early October. The opportunity within merchant is substantial. And when at scale, we expect it will add 1 percentage point to overall fee revenue growth. Credit trends overall are holding up very well supported by our long track record of disciplined client selection. Our consumer portfolios are constructed around prime and super-prime exposures. Within these portfolios, consumer delinquency rates remain stable. We are continuing to see sound fundamentals from our commercial customers. They've managed this rate cycle and inflationary changes well with stable revenue and profitability trends. Overall, our customers continue to show strength and resiliency, which supports a constructive outlook for sustained organic growth. We exited the third quarter with robust production levels in September and with momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter. As an example, our Regional Banking group posted record loan production ex-PPP in the third quarter. Heading into the fourth quarter, late-stage commercial pipelines at quarter-end are up 68% from a year-ago. Our teams are actively implementing our down beta action plans. Fee revenue growth was robust in the third quarter and we have confidence in our many initiatives including merchant acquiring, as well as the outlook for capital markets and advisory revenues, given strong pipelines as we enter the fourth quarter. We are maintaining disciplined expense management, while continuing to invest. The additional efficiency actions we took in the third quarter will support our ability to sustain investment into revenue producing initiatives into 2025. Credit remains a hallmark of Huntington with stable charge-offs and improved non-performing and criticized assets. In closing, we have confidence in our ability to sustain our organic growth outlook as we finish the year and move into 2025. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our third quarter results. We reported earnings per common share of $0.33. The quarter included $6 million of notable items on a net basis and did not have an impact to earnings per share. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in at 16.2% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 16.3%. Pre-provision net revenue or PPNR increased by 8.3% from the prior quarter. This was driven by net interest income, which expanded by 2.9% and fee revenues, which increased by 6.5% from the prior quarter. Average loan balances increased by $3.7 billion or 3.1% versus last year. Average deposits continued to grow, increasing by $8.3 billion or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality remains strong with net charge-offs of 30 basis points. Allowance for credit losses decreased by 2 basis points and ended the quarter at 1.93%. Adjusted CET1 ended the quarter at 8.9% and increased roughly 30 basis points from last quarter. Supported by earnings, as well as the recapture of AOCI from lower rates, tangible book value per share has increased by 21.5% year-over-year. Turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our plan and prior guidance, year-over-year average loan growth is accelerating. Q3 loan growth was 3.1% year-over-year, rising from last quarter's 1.7% growth and the 1.3% we posted in Q1. Average loan balances increased sequentially by $1.1 billion. Excluding runoff from commercial real estate, loans increased by $1.6 billion or 1.3%. As Steve mentioned, end-of-period loans increased by 1.6% and represented a 6.3% annualized growth rate. Loan growth in the quarter was supported by strong contributions from core businesses and from new initiatives. Our new initiatives collectively represented $700 million of growth in the quarter and included Carolinas, Texas, fund finance, healthcare asset-based lending, and Native American Financial Services. Note, this pace of growth was above the second quarter level as teams continue to ramp up and we expect growth in the fourth quarter to be further above these levels. Other drivers of loan growth in the third quarter included $595 million from consumer auto, $268 million from regional banking, $165 million from residential mortgage, $137 million from auto floor plan, $80 million from RV/Marine, $131 million from all other consumer categories on a net basis, and $109 million from all other commercial categories on a net basis. This growth was partially offset by a seasonal decline in distribution finance, which was lower by $747 million. Generally we see the third quarter as the seasonal low point in the year for this business given inventory levels across our mix of programs. We expect inventories to build into the fourth quarter and resulting balances to be higher in the fourth quarter on average compared to the third quarter. Turning to Slide 8. As noted, we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth. Average deposits increased by $2.9 billion or 1.9% in the third quarter. On a full-quarter basis, total cost of deposits increased by 2 basis points in the third quarter and interest-bearing deposit costs were flat for the quarter. Within the quarter, there were notable declines in deposit costs. We saw total cost of deposits decline sequentially in both August and September with September costs lower by 7 basis points. This is a direct result of our proactive and disciplined execution of our down beta action plans in advance of the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut in September and continuing into Q4. These actions reflect our active balancing of deposit volumes and rate. Given our robust deposit growth over the past year, we're in a strong position to optimize rates from here. We will remain very dynamic in managing the business and our action plan as this interest rate environment evolves. Our forecast is aligned with a forward curve, which projects two additional 25 basis point rate cuts by year-end and a further five 25 basis point rate cuts in 2025. As we noted in the past several quarters related to guidance on up beta, the performance and trajectory of down beta will be a function of the actual and projected path of rates and importantly, customer expectations for that path. Based on the current rate outlook, we continue to project a cumulative down beta in the mid to high 30s by the fourth quarter of 2025 and in the mid-40s range by the fourth quarter of 2026. Turning to Slide 9. Our cumulative deposit growth since early 2023 totaled 7.1%. This level continues to well outpace the peer group. As a result, we've been able to decisively implement the down beta strategy, fund loan growth with deposits, and at the same time manage the loan-to-deposit ratio lower over the past year, which will support the continued acceleration of lending. On to Slide 10. For the quarter, net interest income increased by $39 million or 2.9% to $1.364 billion. We delivered sustained growth off of the trough levels from the first quarter of this year, consistent with our guidance. Net interest margin was 2.98% for the third quarter. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q2, we saw a decrease of 1 basis point. This was due to spread net of free funds lower by 2 basis points, higher cash balances driving margin lower by 2 basis points, partially offset by lower drag from the hedging program, which improved by 3 basis points. We continue to project full year net interest income to be within our prior guidance range. The fourth quarter level is expected to be flat to up 1% on a year-over-year basis and then resume growth over the first half of 2025 and accelerate in the second half. This is expected to result in record net interest income for 2025 based on current rate curve expectations. We continue to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing with loan yields expanding by 4 basis points from the prior quarter. This occurred even as SOFR moved lower during the quarter. As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios for both short-term rates, as well as the slope and belly of the curve. As I noted earlier, our working assumption includes two additional rate cuts by year-end and a further five cuts in 2025 and underlies this net interest income outlook. Turning to Slide 11. Our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from sustained deposit growth. We expect cash and securities as a percentage of total average assets to remain at approximately 28% as the balance sheet grows over time. We are reinvesting securities cash flows in treasuries and expect to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio at approximately the current range. We have increased the average duration of new securities purchases from very short half year duration to slightly longer two to three year durations, which is a component of our strategy to systematically reduce asset sensitivity over the next several quarters. Turning to Slide 12. Over the course of the rate cycle, we've positioned the company to benefit from asset sensitivity as the rate environment moved higher and are now reducing our level of asset sensitivity as market expectations are increasingly weighted toward a down rate path. That strategy has worked well to maximize the benefit from the rate cycle and to protect capital, while managing NIM within a tight corridor. On the bottom of the slide, there is an illustration of the asset sensitivity path over the next several quarters. In Q3, we lowered our asset sensitivity by more than one-third from the second quarter. Looking forward, we expect the total cumulative reduction in asset sensitivity from Q2 to be greater than 50% by year-end 2024 and moving to above 60% by mid-2025. As always, we will continue to dynamically manage our hedging program to achieve our objectives of capital protection and NIM stabilization. Moving on to Slide 13. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income increased by $32 million to $523 million for the third quarter. Adjusting for the impacts of CRT transactions and the pay fix swaptions mark-to-market from the prior year, fee revenues increased by $55 million or 12% on a core underlying basis. Moving on to Slide 14. Our strategy to increase the penetration and usage of value-added fee services is building on momentum we've created over the last several years. Adjusted fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues have increased from 25% a year-ago to 28% in Q3. This reflects the focused effort on key initiatives across payments, wealth management, and capital markets. Within payments, revenues have increased by $4 million in the third quarter and have increased by $6 million year-over-year. Commercial payments revenues, including treasury management fees, have grown strongly increasing by 8% from the prior year. Debit card revenue grew by 3% year-over-year reflecting performance higher than industry averages yet clearly impacted by the relatively slower levels of consumer spending growth we are seeing economy-wide. Other card-based revenues continued to grow year-over-year supported by consumer credit card spending trends. The addition of merchant acquiring in-house capabilities will further support our overall payments revenue growth as we enter the fourth quarter and carry into 2025. As Steve noted earlier, we see this initiative adding approximately 1 percentage point to overall fee revenue growth next year. Within wealth management, revenue growth was outstanding increasing 18% from the prior year. Advisory relationships have increased by 7% year-over-year and assets under management have increased 22% on a year-over-year basis. These results benefited from sustained positive net asset flows. Within capital markets, we saw exceptionally strong revenue growth increasing by $26 million or 50% from the prior year to $78 million. These results were driven by commercial banking related capital markets revenues, which are accelerating as we have previously guided as a result of higher commercial loan production. As we look out into Q4, we expect to post another quarter of sequential growth in capital markets driven by continued underlying core banking related services and a robust advisory pipeline. We expect this positive momentum to carry into 2025. Moving on to Slide 15 on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense increased by $13 million and underlying core expenses also increased by $13 million. During the quarter, we incurred $13 million of expenses related to efficiency programs, which will benefit our 2025 expense outlook and allow us to reinvest savings into key revenue producing initiatives. Additionally, this was partially offset by a $7 million benefit from the FDIC special assessment. Net, notable items for the quarter totaled $6 million. Excluding these items, core expenses came in slightly better than our expectations for the quarter at $1.124 billion. The increase in core expenses quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by personnel expenses due to higher salaries and benefit costs. We also saw $3 million of higher expenses related to merchant acquiring as we brought that business in-house and launched our services in October. We continue to forecast approximately 4.5% core expense growth for the full year. Slide 16 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier-1 ended the quarter at 10.4%. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI, was 8.9% and has grown 90 basis points from a year-ago. Our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher, while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth. We intend to drive adjusted CET1 inclusive of AOCI into our operating range of 9% to 10%. On Slide 17, credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 30 basis points in Q3, relatively stable over the past four quarters. Allowance for credit losses at 1.93% declined by 2 basis points from the prior quarter and reflects both modestly improved economic outlook, as well as an increased loan portfolio. On Slide 18, the criticized asset ratio decreased by 9% from the prior quarter to 4.09%. The non-performing asset ratio declined by 1 basis point to 62 basis points. Turning to Slide 19. Our outlook for the full-year remains unchanged from our prior guidance. Our expectations for the fourth quarter include accelerating loan growth at approximately 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. Deposit growth is expected to increase between 4% and 5% on a year-over-year basis. We see full-year net interest income unchanged from our prior guidance range. The fourth quarter level is expected to be flat to up 1% on a year-over-year basis and then resume growth in the first half of 2025 and accelerating in the second half. Core fee revenues adjusted for the swaptions and CRT items are expected to grow at approximately 8% to 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Core expenses are well managed and tracking to our full-year outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect growth of approximately 3% year-over-year subject to some variability given revenue driven compensation levels, as well as expenses related to the insourcing of our merchant acquiring business, which brings with it direct offsetting fee revenues. This is consistent with our previous commentary to exit the year at a low single-digit year-over-year expense growth rate. Credit is performing well, aligned with our expectations and net charge-offs are projected to be relatively similar to Q3. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter is likely to be between 18% and 19%. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move over to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up and then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Manan. Manan Gosalia : Good morning. So the guidance for 4Q NII I think implies that NII should be flat to slightly down versus 3Q. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is that just a timing difference between those floating rate asset yields coming down and deposit costs coming down? Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Manan. This is Zach. I'll take that one. And the short answer to the question is, yes. Just a short timing difference between the really powerful and very effective actions we've seen on reducing deposit costs, which you saw some of the trends we illustrated in the third quarter. Those will continue into the fourth quarter, just not fully offsetting on a short-term basis the reductions in variable yields. I think we'll exit Q4 having a positive run rate benefit from deposit costs relative to asset yields; but in the early part of the quarter assuming, again, two more rate cuts, which is our forecast here, will likely be a little lower quarter-to-quarter. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And can you share more color on the deposit growth there? It looks like you continue to grow deposits faster than loans this quarter. Is that mostly coming from new account growth? And I guess the question there is, why not pay down some of the higher cost CDs to help NII and have deposits grow a little bit slower than loans given that you pre-funded a lot of the loan growth in the first half of the year? Zach Wasserman : A terrific question, Manan, and that is effectively the plan. We're really pleased to see how much deposit growth we've seen throughout the course of this year, obviously, very significantly faster than the industry average overall. And that really puts us in a pretty strong position now with having brought down loan-to-deposit ratio and just given how strong that deposit gathering has been to now turn and drive down beta and to begin to decelerate deposit growth even as loan growth is accelerating. So if you look at the guidance we've given for deposits into the fourth quarter, I would expect the balances to be relatively flat actually quarter-to-quarter even if they still grow year-on-year and that's really an indication that we're doing exactly what you just said, leveraging that position to really drive funding costs lower. Manan Gosalia : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Two things. One, I guess Zach, just wanted to follow-up. I think you mentioned NII, I guess you have the guidance for fourth quarter and then did you mean to say that the growth accelerates from the 4Q versus 3Q level as we think about first half 2025 and then get even faster through the course of 2025? If you could just clarify that. And with that, what's the sensitivity to rate cuts, right? Like we had very strong retail sales so the market's actively recalibrating what the Fed may or may not do. Just talk to us whether getting three to four cuts versus not getting those cuts means much in terms of your NII outlook? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question, EP. Appreciate the chance to unpack and clarify a bit. So, our general expectations for NIM are to be a few basis points lower into the fourth quarter really driven by what I was talking about from Manan's question earlier, just a short timing impact before which -- before accelerating beta starts to fully offset and more than offset the variable -- impacts on variable loans. I will note as well that one of the major benefits we'll have to NIM here is our hedging program. And just for the facts, we had around 12 basis points of hedge dragging in the second quarter -- sorry, in the third quarter. That's going to reduce, if you look at the forward yield curve, down to 7 basis points in Q4 and flip over the course of 2025 to a 5 basis point benefit by the end of 2025. So beta accelerating and the hedge drag continually reducing and then beginning to be a hedge benefit as you go throughout the course of next year really are the drivers of why we expect to see sustained NIM expansion from the Q4 level into Q1, into Q2, and Q3 and then continuing on from there. So expect to see nice upward drift in NIM from the Q4 level throughout the course of 2025. And when you couple that with the really robust loan growth we're driving, that will be what drives NII higher over the course of 2025. We expect, as I noted in my prepared remarks, record NII dollars in 2025 really driven by those two factors. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. Zach Wasserman : And then just -- I'll expand a bit on your question on sensitivities. So I think your point is very well noted. It's a pretty dynamic environment here for sure. And while our underlying forecast assumes a couple of more rate cuts this quarter and then five into next year, you could very well not see those as you noted. I think in the short term for us if you saw less rate cuts, you'd see an even better NIM performance and an even better NII dollar performance. Of course, as you know well, what would also matter a lot is the reason why you're not seeing those rate reductions and what that would imply about customer and market beliefs about where rates are going. And so in the longer term, that would be uncertain impact, but in the short term, it would be universally positive for us to have less rate cuts. If there's more, I think again it kind of matters why. I do think, for example, EP, earlier this year when we saw market expectations for rate reductions really accelerate a lot, that was very helpful to drive the actions around down beta. And so, if you did see more rate reductions, while it might produce a little bit of short-term headwinds, but over the longer term it might actually be even better for down rate deposit pricing. And so, again, sort of a little uncertain over the short -- over the long-term there if rates are even faster down. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And I guess just one thing. You talked earlier about traction in Carolinas, just how loan growth was evolving. Talk to us in terms of deposit growth. You did hire sort of a big team on the mortgage side. Are we seeing mortgage rates pull back? But either that team or just the overall deposit-gathering strategy beyond promotional rates, where do you see deposit growth coming from? Zach Wasserman : Yes. I mean, what we've seen with deposit performance throughout the year is consumer has been really, really strong. But over the course of the last several quarters, commercial now starting to really catch-up. And I think that's driven both by our core commercial business, but also by some of the new verticals and new markets. The mortgage service vertical in particular has been doing really well through driving a couple of billion dollars of incremental deposits in the third quarter and, as I think we've noted before, that could grow -- continue to grow longer term here as well. So it's -- commercial is now beginning to accelerate and I think as we have an outlook for 2025, I would expect -- we're generally expecting continued deposit growth with the mix being slightly more commercial than consumer as we go into next year. Ebrahim Poonawala : Noted. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve Steinour : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : A couple -- one clarification I think, maybe a simple question. But you're saying fourth quarter NII around $1.330 billion, $1.340 billion, something like that. Am I reading that right? Zach Wasserman : We are expecting between $15 million to $25 million lower sequentially, Jon. That will be around flat to up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Again, assuming not only the [indiscernible], but another 225 sort of in the last few months of this year. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then kind of a simple question, funny question. But on Slide 10, I kind of want to joke about the scaling of that, but the fourth quarter 2025 bar chart implies higher NII. Is there -- odd question. Is there any scaling to that, Zach, or what kind of an acceleration do you expect in NII growth throughout the year? Zach Wasserman : I'm expecting pretty steady NII dollar growth from Q1 to Q2, from Q2 to Q3, and continuing on, Jon. I think kind of the path of NIM [indiscernible] we're starting now to get into a bit of overly level precision at this point given all the uncertainties. But generally speaking, I'm expecting to see nice sustained NIM expansion in Q1, Q2, Q3, and a bit topping out into Q4, but we'll see where the rate environment is at that point. And the dollars really be pretty steady growth throughout the year as lending sustains at a fairly solid level. It's probably the best way I can answer your question. Jon Arfstrom : Yes. Okay. Good. If I can squeeze one more. And I apologize for doing this. But the merchant acquiring, you're saying 1% growth to overall fee revenues. Are you saying that could be a $200 million business? Is that [Multiple Speakers] Zach Wasserman : Currently -- a little bit off. We make roughly $25 million on a run rate annual basis for merchant acquiring in the old outsourced model that we have. As we in-source that business, we're thinking next year could be fill the $50 million in terms of overall revenue, which is that's an extra $25 million, sort of about 1% of the overall fee revenue base as you go into next year. Jon Arfstrom : Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you for clarifying this. Steve Steinour : Yes. Good questions. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Erika. Operator : Erika, perhaps your line may be muted. Your line for questions. Erika Najarian : Can you hear me? Steve Steinour : Yes, we can hear you now. Go ahead. Erika Najarian : Apologies. Sorry about that. So Zach, as you can imagine, everybody is asking about the blank box on 4Q 2025 for Slide 10. So maybe I'll ask it this way. So consensus wants to fill that box that would imply 8% year-over-year growth from your implied fourth quarter 2024. So I'm assuming that has loan growth and also the NIM inflection. So with that -- with consensus filling that box in at up 8% quarter-over-quarter, are they in the right ballpark as we think about your loan growth momentum and the dynamics of your balance sheet? Zach Wasserman : I'm not going to give you that level of guidance precision at this point in the year, Erika. As you know, we will give guidance as we get into the early part of next year. But I don't think that's directionally wrong, frankly. I think we're expecting to see NIMs rise throughout the course of 2025. I mentioned earlier, I see NIM above 3% in the second half of next year. If you compare that to where we'll be this year, that will be a nice NIM expansion off of our forecast for Q4. So that will drive some year-over-year growth. And then our current run rate on loan growth is around 6% on an annualized pace right now and there's nothing that indicates we will not be able to sustain that pace into next year. In fact the fourth quarter looks outstanding in terms of loan growth and the momentum we've got across the business. And so, those are relatively good underlying drivers to get to the number you're talking about without being overly clear on guidance at this point. Erika Najarian : That's helpful. Thank you. And on the expense run rate, I think, Zach, what you and Steve have been talking about in terms of investments really showed through with regards to your 3% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter -- sorry, year-over-year fourth quarter guide for fourth quarter relative to the run-rate for this year. And we're seeing it in the loan growth. As we think about next year with the caveat that Huntington under this management team and Board is constantly investing, should we expect more of a harvest year so to speak in that perhaps that fourth quarter run rate year-over-year is more sustainable rather than the 5%, 5.5%? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question. In the area of expenses, it's something we're incredibly rigorously focused on and this year is playing out pretty much exactly like we expected, hitting the roughly 4.5% year-over-year growth, decelerating throughout the year as you noted. And really, Erika, staying focused on the model that we've got, driving efficiencies and baseline expenses. You saw us take another series of actions in the third quarter, all those are continuing on. It's a fairly continual process of driving our engineering to enable us to really drive the offensive expense categories that are investment related, technology development, marketing, additions of people to go and drive some new great revenue producing initiatives. The plan for 2025 is the same as we've had before, drive for positive operating leverage. I do expect, a little bit to the point of your last question, to have a pretty solid revenue growth trajectory. And so I don't intend to -- we collectively don't intend to be in harvest mode. We want to keep driving for growth, but certainly to drive very solid improvement, a positive operating leverage and efficiency ratio and then just to sustain that as we go forward. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you so much. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Question on fee revenues. It came in a decent amount better than you expected with the intra-quarter guide. I assume a lot of that swing is the capital markets and maybe the loan sale. But just anything else that surprised you that you'd want to call out? I mean all the categories actually did pretty well. So I guess, I'm just wondering was that kind of better than what you thought a month ago? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question, Matt. And it was primarily capital markets that you noted in the basis of your question saw -- we were expecting to see a pretty solid Q3 for capital markets, but it beat our expectations even better than that. Overall really, really pleased with the execution of the sustained level of performance we're seeing in the three key areas of focus. 12% year-over-year growth in fees is pretty outstanding from our perspective. The outlook for Q4 is likewise pretty solid, particularly in capital markets, I think we'll see another really good quarter of sequential growth in the cap markets. We'll also continue to drive a good underlying household acquisition and net flows and then payments really chugging along here, particularly with the addition of merchant acquiring should be a nice lift on tailwind to growth. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then on the credit risk transfer or the CRTs as you call it. Now that you've got \u2013 you are approaching your targeted capital level even including AOCI and you've got all the funding and all those positives, is that something that you're looking to do less of going forward or unwind them? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question. On the plan to grow capital, we feel really good about how that's going and as we've noted a number of times, the primary and most significant driver of our plan to continue to drive capital higher is just core organic earnings and strong return on capital. We look at these CRT transactions as really tactical as opportunistic. They're kind of an interesting innovation in the marketplace for sure that offer great low return on capital for certain asset classes. Just look back to the transaction we did in the second quarter, we unlocked 17 basis points of capital for less than 3% cost of capital, just $7 million plus transaction costs. So very, very efficient. So it's possible we'll be opportunistic in the future on these, but they're really -- we see them in that light, opportunistic and the core is really the underlying return on capital and organic earnings. Matt O'Connor: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Sean Sorahan with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Sean Sorahan : Good morning. I was hoping you could address your trends and strategy in the auto business. Production stepped up again linked-quarter in 3Q. Can you talk about the growth outlook there a little bit? And then maybe shifting to credit, there was a big update mid-quarter from an auto peer and you saw a little bit of a step-up in 3Q this quarter. Can you address expected credit trends giving shifting auto values? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Sean, thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll take the first part and then Brendan will tack on to the second part around credit. So really pleased actually with what we're seeing in the auto lower production area. Auto for us is a terrific asset to lean into at times like this when the general expectation for rates is to be reducing. A nice fixed asset class, got about a two-year duration. Remember this is prime and super-prime credit quality, so very solid underlying returns and also incredibly efficient business for us. It's a 10% efficiency ratio business for us that is very, very optimizable. We can put in pricing in the market on Friday, see the impacts of it over the weekend, dial it back in again the next Tuesday as we go into the next week. And so really, really optimizable and precision return calibration for us here. So, we like this one. I think the production levels for the fourth quarter look to be around the same as the third quarter here. So I think we've hit a nice run rate at this point and then we'll see where it goes out into the course of next year. But for right now, nice fixed asset that we're getting very significant fixed asset repricing benefits coming through into the NIM. Maybe Brendan, over to you on credit. Brendan Lawlor : Sure. Sean, this is Brendan. And given our history in this industry, we have the ability to utilize our custom scorecard to really drive the customer selection that Zach was referencing. And that continues to be a strength for us. We've seen late-stage delinquency and charge-offs have remained right within our historical levels. So we're not seeing broad deterioration at all here. And frankly, with our deep industry expertise and we're traditionally lower than the peer set when it comes to charge-offs or delinquencies and that trend continues this quarter. So, we feel real confident in this book. Steve Steinour : Sean, we've been -- this is Steve. We've been very disciplined. We got 15 years of quarterly track record here. It's an area of continued focus and discipline, as well as we refined the model a number of times during the course of the -- that period of time. So we like what we're seeing. We're very confident in it and obviously with the disciplines we have, super-prime prime, we're not going to see what you alluded to from the auto institution. Sean Sorahan : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. And then Zach, shifting over to the hedge program slide, it's always helpful. I noted the received fixed balance in the back half of 2025 came down a bit this quarter versus last. Can you update us on any adjustments made there in the quarter and then maybe highlight any future adjustments you're thinking about? Thanks. Zach Wasserman : Thanks for bringing that question up, Sean. So what we tried to illustrate on that slide is really the continued dynamic management of asset sensitivity really bringing down asset sensitivity a lot, a third reduction in sensitivity just in the third quarter alone, we'll get to 50% reduction from Q2 by the end of this year and then to 60% by the middle of next year. And one of the things we try to highlight all the time in this is we're very dynamic. So we're continually looking at the most efficient way to really do those two objectives of protecting capital and maximizing and stabilizing NIM. So, we'll always make adjustments here as we deem it most efficient. An example of that. We just did another $1 billion of forward-starting receivers just in the early part of this quarter that are really starting out into the second half of 2025 that will just continue to drive asset sensitivity lower at the time we really want it. So, we're always doing this. Really primarily at this point the game plan vis-a-vis asset sensitivity is gradually allow the pay fix swaptions to reduce and to expire, put on more forward-starting receivers when we see nice opportunities in the market to do that, gradually lengthen the duration in our U.S. treasury securities portfolio, and really optimize the kind of funding mix for lower structurally fixed funding, more structurally variable funding, and optimize lower levels of Fed cash. And so, those are really the components that drive the overall reduction in asset sensitivity. Sean Sorahan : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Steinour for closing remarks. Steve Steinour : Thank you for joining us today. In closing, we delivered exceptional results for the third quarter highlighted by the successful execution of organic growth initiatives. Net interest income expanded, fee revenues grew strongly, expenses were well managed, and credit remained stable. Our strategy is working well and our investments in the franchise are delivering returns. We remain in an attractive competitive position and we continue to seize opportunities to add talented bankers across our businesses. Collectively, the Board, executives, and our colleagues are a Top 10 shareholder. So, we have strong alignment to deliver sustained value creation for our shareholders. As a reminder, we have an Investor Day scheduled in the New Year on February 6 and you're invited to that. And finally, thank you to all our Huntington colleagues for driving these outstanding results. Thank you very much for joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides, we will be reviewing today, can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; Brendan Lawlor, Chief Credit Officer will join us for the Q&A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve. Steve Steinour : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. Building on a good third quarter, we delivered very strong fourth quarter results, which Zach will detail later. 2024 was an exceptional year for Huntington with our teams delivering accelerated growth over the course of the year. We're very grateful to our 20,000 colleagues who drove these results, while living our purpose every day, as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. Now on to Slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, we drove record fee revenues and accelerated growth of loans and deposits. This reflected contributions from both existing and new businesses. Our investments into new geographies and capabilities are delivering attractive returns and we're seeing accelerated contributions from these new areas. We delivered sequential growth in both spread and fee revenues in the quarter. We move into 2025 with strong momentum. We are poised to deliver record net interest income and fee revenues for the full year. Third, we are executing our down beta action plans and lowering deposit pricing. This supports management of net interest margin through a dynamic interest rate environment. Fourth, we are achieving strong credit performance. This is a direct result of our disciplined client selection and rigorous portfolio management aligned with our aggregate moderate-to-low-risk appetite. Fifth, through execution of our growth strategies, we are driving profit momentum into 2025 and beyond. I'll move us on to Slide 5 to recap our performance last year. 2024 was a breakout year for Huntington. Our many years of consistent and disciplined management benefited us as we came into the year with robust liquidity and capital as well as stable credit. This position of strength enabled us to accelerate growth in our core, add new capabilities and teams and expand into new geographies in North and South Carolina as well as Texas. We're just getting started here. We believe our investments and focused execution will deliver robust organic growth in future years. The results in 2024 included growing average deposits by over $7.5 billion and growing average loans by over $3.5 billion. Our growth accelerated over the course of the year with our new initiatives increasing contributions to our overall results. Additionally, our fee revenue businesses are performing exceptionally well. Within payments, we brought in-house our merchant acquiring capabilities and increased treasury management products and services. Within wealth management, we're expanding advisory household relationships 9% year-over-year and gathering increased wealth assets from our customers. Capital markets set a new quarterly record for revenue in the fourth quarter at $120 million, an increase of 74% from a year ago. Turning to Slide 6. Let me take a moment to share the top-level revenue trends we've delivered. The organic growth we are driving continues to significantly outpace our peer group. We are well positioned to drive attractive and sustained revenue. These revenue growth trends support expanding PPNR into 2025 and beyond. Now let's turn to Slide 7. The growth opportunities today are the most attractive they've been since I joined Huntington. We have three primary areas of focus. These include executing the organic growth strategy I shared earlier, driving revenues higher and maintaining our consistent approach to risk management. We have numerous growth levers, both in our existing markets and businesses as well as the collective set of expanded geographies and new capabilities. We see substantive opportunities to expand loans, deposits and value-added fee revenues. These efforts will result in sustained revenue expansion in both fee and spread revenue. Huntington benefits from a consistent approach to risk management that has served us well for many years. We expect this bedrock principle to remain unchanged as we maintain our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance. Zach Wasserman : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported earnings per common share of $0.34. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in at 16.4% for the quarter. Average loan balances increased by $7 billion or 5.7% versus last year. Average deposits increased by $9.7 billion or 6.5% versus last year. CET1 ended the quarter at 10.5% and increased roughly 30 basis points from last year. Adjusted common equity Tier 1, including AOCI was 8.7%. Tangible book value per share has increased by 6.9% year-over-year. We maintained strong credit performance and are positioned to continue to outperform. Net charge-offs were 30 basis points, stable from the prior quarter. Allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at 1.88%. Turning to Slide 9. Consistent with our plan and prior guidance, year-over-year average loan growth continued to accelerate. Loan growth in the fourth quarter increased 5.7% year-over-year, rising from 3.1% year-over-year in Q3. Average loan balances increased sequentially by $3.7 billion or 2.9%. This exceptional loan growth reflects strong production and contributions from our existing and new businesses. During the quarter, new initiatives represented $1.1 billion in growth or 30% of the total net loan growth. Growth from new initiatives continued to accelerate as we have guided previously, increasing from approximately $700 million and $500 million in the prior two quarters. Of the $3.1 billion of loan growth from existing businesses, we saw $766 million from auto, $421 million from regional banking, commercial and industrial, $511 million from asset finance, $327 million from higher auto floorplan balances, $85 million from seasonally higher balances within distribution finance, $165 million from all other consumer categories net, including increases from residential mortgage and home equity, offset by lower RV and marine balances and approximately $800 million collectively across the commercial bank. Of the $1.1 billion of loan growth from new initiatives, the largest contributions in the quarter came from Funds Finance, North and South Carolina and Texas. Offsetting a portion of this growth was lower commercial real estate balances, which declined by $465 million. Turning to Slide 10. The result of our accelerated loan growth continues to be a differentiated position compared to our peers. Over the last year through the third quarter, the peer group reported lower loan balances, down nearly 3% at the median. During this time, Huntington outperformed the median by approximately 6%. Importantly, we have sustained deposit growth to self-fund our expanded loan balances with deposit growth also substantially outperforming peers on a cumulative basis. Turning to Slide 11. We delivered deposit growth through the fourth quarter. Average deposits increased by $2.9 billion or 1.9%. This growth was led by our commercial customers. Non-interest-bearing deposits expanded, growing by approximately $800 million on average, totaling 18.6% of total deposits. We lowered our overall cost of deposits in the quarter by 24 basis points to 2.16%. This is consistent with the trajectory we shared in our mid-quarter update and reflects our disciplined deposit pricing. On to Slide 12. During the quarter, we drove a $45 million or 3.3% growth in net interest income. This reflects over 6% growth year-over-year and net interest income has increased for the third consecutive quarter. Net interest margin was 3.03% for the fourth quarter, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The change in net interest margin included 3 basis points lower spread net of free funds, more than offset by 3 basis points benefit from lower cash balances and a 5 basis-point benefit from lower drag from the hedging program. Turning to Slide 13. Our level of cash and securities at year end decreased to 28% of total assets, as we saw modestly lower cash balances in the quarter. We expect to operate at or around this level going forward. We have continued to reinvest securities cash flows into treasuries and, as previously stated, expect to manage the duration of the portfolio at approximately the current range. As previously disclosed, we sold approximately $1 billion of corporate securities during the fourth quarter. This repositioning was beneficial to risk-weighted assets and capital ratios and resulted in a pre-tax loss of $21 million with an earn back of less than two years. Turning to Slide 14. We continue to manage our hedging program with two objectives in mind, to protect net interest margin from a lower rate environment as well as to protect capital from a potential higher rate environment. We have remained relatively stable in our hedging position since November. We continue to monitor the likelihood of potential rate scenarios and will remain dynamic as we adjust to the rate environment. Moving to Slide 15. On a GAAP basis, non-interest income increased by $154 million from the prior year. On a core underlying basis, adjusting for the impacts of the loss on securities, CRT transactions and the pay fixed swaptions mark-to-market from the prior year, fee revenues increased by $96 million or 20%. Moving to Slide 16. We have continued to see powerful acceleration from our focus on three strategic fee businesses. For the full year, fee revenues as a percentage of total revenue increased to 28% from 26% the prior year. Within payments, we saw 8% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter, driven by a 16% increase in commercial payment revenues, benefiting from higher treasury management fees and the launch of our new merchant acquiring model. Wealth management fees increased by 8% from the prior year. AUM continued to grow, increasing 16% from the prior year, with wealth advisory households having increased by 9%. Finally, Capital Markets completed a record quarter with $120 million in revenue. That's up 74% from the prior year. Our Capstone Group had a phenomenal quarter, helping to lead our strong capital markets results. Turning to Slide 17. GAAP non-interest expense increased sequentially by $48 million and underlying core expenses increased by $57 million from Q3. The primary driver of the increase in expenses was in personnel costs, largely comprised of higher revenue-driven compensation expense, which was $42 million higher in the quarter. Slide 18 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.5%. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI, was 8.7%, up approximately 10 basis points from a year ago. Our capital management strategy remains focused on driving our top priority to fund high-return loan growth while also driving capital ratios higher. We intend to drive adjusted CET1 inclusive of AOCI into our operating range of 9% to 10%. On Slide 19, credit quality continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 30 basis points for the quarter, stable from Q3 and within 1 basis point of that level over the past four quarters. For the full year, net charge-offs also totaled 30 basis points, well within our through-the-cycle range. Allowance for credit losses was at 1.88%, lower by 5 basis points from the prior quarter. This reflects the continued strong credit performance and loan portfolio growth. Turning to Slide 20. The criticized asset ratio improved for the third consecutive quarter to 3.76%. The non-performing asset ratio ended the quarter at 63 basis points, relatively stable over the prior three quarters. Let's turn to Slide 21 for our outlook for 2025. We expect to continue to drive robust loan growth with balances expected to increase between 5% and 7% for the full year. Deposits are also expected to sustain growth with balances increasing between 3% and 5%. We see net interest income on a dollar basis growing between 4% and 6% this year. As noted, this level would reflect record net interest income on a full year basis. We will maintain our focus on key fee revenue areas, including payments, wealth management and capital markets, which we expect to lead to noninterest income growth between 4% and 6% for 2025. Expense growth will be driven by sustained investments in revenue-producing initiatives, albeit at a moderately lower pace of growth than we saw in full year 2024. We expect expense growth between 3.5% and 4.5%. The pace of expense growth will in part be driven by revenue levels and the associated variable compensation expense. Importantly, we see positive operating leverage for full year 2025. Related to credit, we expect net charge-offs for the year to be between 25 and 35 basis points. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 19%. Let me also share a couple of thoughts on where we see trends for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. We expect average loan balances to grow approximately 2%, average deposits to be relatively stable sequentially, net interest income on a dollar basis to be lower by approximately 2% to 3%, reflecting normal day count headwinds as well as a modestly lower net interest margin. Fee revenues normalizing in the first quarter given seasonality and recognizing the record level we delivered in the fourth quarter. Fee revenues are expected to be approximately $500 million in the first quarter and then expand from that level over the course of the year. Expenses are likewise expected to be lower in the first quarter, given the strong year-end production levels we delivered in the fourth quarter. We forecast expenses to be down approximately 2% from the fourth quarter, the exact level of which will fluctuate dependent on revenue-driven compensation. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you. Tim Sedabres : Thank you, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. Zach Wasserman : Good morning. Manan Gosalia : Zach, can you talk about the confidence around the NII guidance range? It's a tighter range than last year. And I ask because I know there's a lot of uncertainty from trade and immigration and tax policy. So I just wanted to get a sense of what's embedded in that guide from a macro perspective. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question, Manan. I appreciate your focus on that and the short answer to your question is we're very confident that we can drive revenue growth within that range. Ultimately, when we see the year playing out, obviously, still pretty dynamic here in terms of short-term rate outlook and even what's going on in the belly in the longer term part of the curve. But we see the ability to manage the NIM within any reasonable range of zero cuts to up to two or three cuts at approximately flat throughout the course of 2025, rising as we go into 2026 and beyond with the normal upward sloping yield curve and just continued growth in the -- in high return areas, but generally flat in NIM for 2025. It's really going to be loan growth therefore and earnings asset growth overall that drives the revenue performance this year. And we think we've set the range at a level that's very achievable and within the run rates that we're seeing now. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And you're growing loans faster than deposits this year. It sounds like you're reversing some of the trend that we've seen in 2024. Can you talk about what's driving that? And does that give you more room to flex on deposit costs as you go through the year? Zach Wasserman : Yes. That's another good one. Look, in terms of loan growth, we're running right now in the -- in the fourth quarter, we just posted 5.7% growth, greater than the 5% that we've been calling out for some time in terms of the exit growth rate we'd see. Feel really good about that. As we noted in some of the prepared remarks, about 60% of that coming from the core, 40% from the new initiatives. So really good mix of growth. As we go into 2025, that 5% to up to 7% growth in loans is for the most part just sort of continuing on that run rate. But we think the growth composition in 2025 will be approximately half-and-half between the core and the new initiatives. So continuing to see nice balance, but certainly great performance in -- across the board. As we -- as you think about the loan-to-deposit ratio, we were very intentional over the course of the last couple of years to drive strong deposit growth. I think we've talked a number of times before this that to some degree, we were prefunding what we expected to be accelerating loan growth and so hopefully -- so pleased to see that plan play out well. As we think about the plan for '25, growing deposits still pretty well here, between 3% and 5%, our core funding most of the loan growth, but also benefiting from the fact that we have taken the loan to deposit ratio down a bit. So I think that does set us up pretty well to continue to drive the beta plan, which has outperformed thus far into the first quarter and see further down deposit pricing even as we accelerate loan growth. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from John Pancari of Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Zach Wasserman : Hi, John. John Pancari : On -- related to that growth that you're just talking about on the loan side, can you maybe help us with the new money loan production yield that you're bringing on these new loans at, so overall, new money production yield versus your existing yield? And then maybe more specifically underneath that, what is the new money yield on that $1.1 billion this quarter generated from the new initiatives? Zach Wasserman : I appreciate the question, John. And I'm not going to dive into the depths of that, but I'll sort of talk a bit about this at a high level. The yields we're seeing ultimately are very consistent with kind of spread levels we've got in the business overall. That's why you're seeing that pretty consistent level of NIM. Obviously, the business being roughly 50% fixed asset production. Those are keyed off of the belly of the curve, the other 50% being variable keyed off of the shorter end. One of the things I didn't say, just a minute ago, when Manan was asking was that, if you sort of unpack what's going on in yields and NIM, we continue to benefit from quite a bit of fixed asset repricing given where the belly is and so all those things will help us together to get to that stable NIM we talked about before. John Pancari : Okay. All right, Zach. Thank you. And then just hopping to capital. The -- I know the CET1 at 10.5% that's down to -- adjusted for AOCI 8.7% and I know, you're targeting 9% to 10% including of that. So fair to assume, I know buybacks are still kind of on hold. How long do you see that? Do you see a potential change in that outlook as you look at the capital generation that you're forecasting for the year? Just trying to think of how we should think about capital return. Zach Wasserman : Yes. Good question. As you think about capital for us, we're focused on the goals that we've had that are unchanged, most important of which is funding high-return loan growth and so we're pleased that that's really been a great opportunity for us to deploy our internally generated capital. That adjusted CET1 ratio of 8.7%, our objective remains the same, which is to drive that up into the 9% to 10% operating range and I expect that we'll do that within the first half of 2025 and then continue to drive that higher solidly within that range. My working forecast at this point, John, is that if we continue to see RWA growth and loan growth as we're forecasting, it will likely be bouncing around the kind of the low 9s throughout the course of 2025. It obviously also depends on where the longer end of the yield curve is, just where the AOCI marks trend. Yet under that scenario, there's relatively little capacity to do share repurchases in the near term. Over the longer term, as we continue to drive share -- CET1 up into that range, I would expect us to return to more normal distribution, including share repurchases. So, 2025 will to some degree really be dependent on that pace of loan growth and where the longer end of the yield curve ends up coming through. John Pancari : Okay, great. All right. Thanks, Zach. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. Zach Wasserman : Morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, Zach, just following up on the comments around the loan-to-deposit ratio, as we think about, let's say, loan growth meets deposit growth in '25, just talk about your expectations around the incremental margin and what's the incremental cost of deposits that's -- that are coming on relative to where you see the rest of the book repricing? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Good questions. With the loan-to-deposit ratio, we ended with -- exiting Q4 level was 79%. So it really gives us a powerful opportunity to continue to drive loan growth faster than deposit growth for some period of time, even though we're looking to core fund. And look, the marginal spreads we're seeing now are very consistent of us mentioned earlier in John's prior question too, what we've seen in the past and I think obviously, in the near term, we'll continue to see acquisition deposit rates come down and benefit from the lower yield curve is what's going on with Fed funds reductions. But over the longer term, we'll continue to see that NIM begin to rise as we go into 2025 and -- the end of '25, excuse me, into '26 and beyond. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just one quick one on the fee outlook around payments, wealth management cap market. How much of the fee growth is tied to lending or I'm just trying to think through if lending or loan growth are slower, could you still have a fee revenue backdrop which could be in line or better than, what you've guided this morning? Zach Wasserman : No. Fundamentally, the fee strategies are there to support the overall core business and so the faster the core business grows, the more fee revenues opportunities there are, of course, and it will give you a sense as you look at some of our new growth initiatives in the Carolinas, in Texas and some of the new specialty commercial businesses. As those grow, we're seeing nice pull-through in terms of fees, particularly treasury management, Ebrahim. With that being said, the -- another core element of the fee strategy is really penetrating the opportunity more fully. So wealth management, for example, I wouldn't consider to be highly correlated with loan growth more around, kind of what we're seeing in terms of penetration. So, it's broadly correlated, but I think also very independent in terms of the strategies that we're driving. My expectation over the long term is we'll see payments, wealth management, capital markets all being high single-digit to low double-digit growth in revenues in a pretty sustainable way over the course of the long term. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Brian Foran of Truist. Please go ahead. Brian Foran : Hi, all. I guess-- Zach Wasserman : Hi, Brian. Brian Foran : Hi, I definitely recognize that your '25 loan and deposit growth guide. Most of your peers so far seem to be like flat, up 2%, so you're continuing peer-leading growth. But just in terms of like -- it's kind of like flat to decelerating in terms of growth rates from where we are now and conceptually like why would you decelerate? Is it macro inputs or is it seasoning of investments? Or what would -- to the extent your growth rates are flat to decelerating, what would drive that kind of change in the derivative, I guess? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Great question, Brian, and appreciate you recognizing this peer leading performance, because we certainly feel pretty good about that. The way I think about it is sustaining the current run rate of loan growth. Again, we talked earlier 5.7% year-over-year in Q4, it's pretty much spot in the middle of the loan growth range and certainly, there's potential that will be at the high end of that range, which would represent acceleration actually of loan growth. Deposit growth of 3% to 5% is somewhat of a deceleration from the growth rate we saw in 2024, but really reflective of us not needing to grow deposits as much and purposely driving down the cost of deposits and benefiting from frankly that, that really advantageous position we have in loan-to-deposit ratio. So a great way to manage the NIM overall in the face of a sort of dynamic interest rate environment we've got at this point. Over the longer term, I would expect to fairly well match up fund with core deposits kind of in the business model as you go out past '25, but we're kind of managing, just the dynamic nature of the environment right now and so that's how I think about it, sustaining about accelerating loans and really purposely managing the deposit volumes to ensure that we can have a solid NIM and drive overall revenue growth, which is the objective in the end. Steve Steinour : Brian, this is Steve. There's also seasonality. We're a very large asset finance lender, as you know, and that typically has a very strong fourth quarter and so annualizing up that fourth quarter, it doesn't reflect seasonality in asset finance and some other businesses that are seasonal in nature, but we're coming into '25 with momentum. We have had -- we're about 50% better this year to last year with pipelines in most of the businesses. So we've got a lot of confidence in the loan growth within the range, we talked about, and perhaps if the outlook continues to be robust, we'll have an opportunity to exceed. Brian Foran : That's really helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, the eight -- I was going to say, eight states and three verticals. The eight verticals and three states, anything you would highlight as kind of the standout on the good side? Do you think that's been maybe a little bit more challenging? And as you think about investments for '25, is it mostly about continuing to invest in the eight and the three? Or is there anything that could potentially be new verticals or new states on the docket? Zach Wasserman : Well, Brian, great question. Thank you. We've invested in the core markets as well as these three new geographic markets and then these eight verticals. So, we've added several hundred of RMs and new business generators in the last year and a half. We're very pleased with the overall performance. We've had some outstanding results. We're off to a strong start in both Carolinas and Texas. Our Funds Finance business has ramped up faster than any business we've had -- any specialty business we've had. They're all doing reasonably well. In aggregate, they're ahead, meaningfully ahead of expectations. But the regional geographies of the Carolinas and Texas on a direct expense basis, all actually made money last year. So we like the start. We're confident. We have excellent colleagues, who are -- who have joined us and we're well positioned to continue that growth. So organic growth is our priority and we'll continue to look for growth from those, where we've made investments and at the same time, as you saw earlier this month, we launched two others with aero, defense and FIG and there will potentially be additional specialty verticals as we go forward, probably not at the rate of the last year and a half. Brian Foran : Thanks so much. Zach Wasserman : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jon Arfstrom : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Zach Wasserman : Hi, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Hi, Steve, just maybe following up on that a little bit on loan growth. You -- or in your prepared comments, you said this -- these are some of the most attractive opportunities you've seen since you've joined Huntington and 50% higher pipelines. Can you talk a little bit about the borrower feedback that you're hearing over the last few months? And then if you could touch a little bit also on the core growth, the $3.1 billion in core growth was obviously much stronger and you guys flagged lower CRE. So just kind of curious, if there's a sentiment change and what's driving that core growth? Steve Steinour : Yes. Jon, the borrower sentiment, the customer sentiment, I should say, is consistently positive. The outlook post-election has changed. You see it in the confidence measures indices that are both consumer and business and so when I'm out, I've probably been out with 100 or so customers and prospects since the election and it's almost 100% or more positive about '25 and beyond. So there is a -- there is a consensus, I think, of expected growth, increased inventories. We saw record asset finance in the fourth quarter, about $600 million more than we did previously as a record and I think that reflects sort of an unlocking of expectations. So, there is a lot of deferred finance activities, I think, in the first half of the year and then waiting to see the election and then decisions were made and significant investments reflected in the fourth quarter. December was a very robust month for us, for example, in the asset finance side. So we're heading in. The momentum we have is reflective, I think, of the settlement and gives us a lot of confidence as we come into the year. In terms of core growth, we -- again, we have some seasonality in that core growth in the fourth quarter with asset finance. And commercial real estate, we believe is close to bottoming out. We're prepared to increase the outstandings and commitments in CRE, the book has performed exceptionally well. In aggregate, the Group is performing exceptionally well. So while we're talking about loan growth, in the same way about fees and deposits with our 2024 performance and so we come into the new year with a lot of confidence in terms of our growth. Jon Arfstrom : Yes. Good. That's very helpful, Steve. And then one more for you with the new administration coming in and some changes in the regulatory leadership, what regulatory changes would you like to see, what could help Huntington? Thanks. Steve Steinour : I think the business community as a whole will benefit from a more positive pro-business orientation with the new administration and so I think you'll see more of acquisition and combinations in the business community as a whole. I think in banking, we will have more stability and less uncertainty about liquidity and capital and other issues. I think the banks generally are well capitalized and this overhang of Basel III, I think, will get addressed fairly quickly. Beyond that, I believe a more constructive dialogue about willingness to do business with less oversight and constraint is probable and we'll just have to see if that develops. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Thank you. Very nice results. Yes. Steve Steinour : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nathan Stein : Hi everyone. This is Nate Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. I wanted to ask about the NIM components. In October, you said NIM should be above 3% in the second half of '25, but you're above 3% now. I heard you say modestly lower NIM in the first quarter, but can you elaborate on your NIM outlook for the full year? Zach Wasserman : Sure. Thank -- excuse me, this is Zach. Thanks for the question. Across the course of the year, I'm expecting to see approximately 3% NIM, plus or minus a few basis points on a quarterly basis, but generally pretty flat throughout the course of this year. As I mentioned a minute ago, we do continue to see the opportunity to drive NIM higher as we go into '26 and beyond, particularly driven by the just continued normalization of an upward sloping yield curve. If you kind of unpack the drivers of NIM in 2025 -- excuse me, one major benefit for us, which we've seen come through powerfully throughout the course of '24 as well as fixed asset repricing. To give you a sense, in 2024, we had about 12 basis points of benefit from fixed asset re-pricing. As we go into 2025, I'm seeing continued benefit and just based on the kind of increases in the belly of the curve in the slightly longer part of the yield curve recently, seeing about 10 basis points likely a benefit from fixed asset re-pricing in 2025. So that will continue to be a really powerful headwind also back -- it will continue into 2026 and beyond, by the way. So that will be one of the drivers of a longer term, continue to move higher in NIM. And then another factor that will be helpful for us is deposit pricing and interest-bearing liability costs continuing to reduce. We did significantly accelerate beyond what our initial plan had been deposit pricing actions in the fourth quarter. It's one of the reasons why we drove outperformance in the fourth quarter more than we would have expected and we continue to feel pretty confident here about being able to drive beta as we previously indicated and see deposit costs come down through the course of the year. Clearly, that will be to some degree a function of what's going on with the interest rate environment and are we in an extended pause or are there further rate reductions and what the strong market and client sentiment is around where interest rates will go, but we do see further opportunity to reduce funding costs. The offset to that clearly would be the 50% of our loans that are in variable pricing status will follow SOFR. SOFR will come down into the first quarter from the fourth quarter on average, just given the kind of late Q4 Fed fund reduction we saw in December. So that's one of the reasons why I've called out likely a little lower net interest margin here in the first quarter. But over the course of the year, we're able to balance the variable yield impact with funding cost reductions and then the last factor is hedging. We saw in the fourth quarter a benefit as the hedge drag continued to reduce as we had previously indicated. I expect to see a further modest benefit as we get into the middle part of this year and then, if the curve stays as it is, probably a few basis points of drag into the back half of the year. If you look kind of across the totality of the year in terms of hedging, likely a couple of basis points benefit on a full-year basis and relatively similar here between Q4 and Q4. So several puts and takes. If I take a step back, for us, the NIM outlook for 2025, it's a pretty dynamic environment and the drivers are different on a quarterly basis. But the net result of that should be about flat throughout the course of this year and then rising as we go into '26 and beyond. Nathan Stein : Okay, great. Thank you. And then separately, can you talk about the securities repositioning you did this quarter? You sold $1 billion of securities and I get there was a big march up in the long end of the yield curve, but are you planning on doing more of these repositionings? Zach Wasserman : Yes, great question. So the short answer to your question in terms of more is not likely. The repositioning that we did was selling about $1 billion of corporate securities that had a higher risk-weighted asset -- excuse me, weight on them and so by selling them and repositioning the portfolio, we were able to unlock capital. Also at a pretty attractive earn back. The teams have now completed the reinvestment of new securities at the higher yields and we expect to see a less than two-year payback on that. So pretty tactical, pretty marginal, I think in overall size, but attractive in and of itself. One of the things that is different with Huntington than perhaps others in the regional banking space is that because we had so effectively hedged the securities portfolio before the rate cycle began that the opportunity to do significant repositioning is simply just smaller and so, the plan we have with the securities portfolio is just to continue the current approach and benefit from those hedges that we have put in place in the past. Nathan Stein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Erika Najarian of UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Zach Wasserman : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Just a question -- good morning. The question I'm getting a lot from investors, and I'm sure you'll address this in Investor Day, is where are you sort of in the investment cycle? I think that investors have fully embraced the accelerated revenue growth at Huntington and really appreciated that you invested when everybody else was battening down the hatches. And as we think about just going forward, do you feel like the opportunities are still there and that you're going to be at a heavier lift from an investment standpoint for now and I'm sure we'll hear about it in a few weeks or is there sort of a point of time where you feel like you can enjoy widening positive operating leverage because you had so front-loaded the investment spend? Steve Steinour : Erika, this is Steve. Thanks for the question. We have a momentum in the investment decisions we've made -- as a result of the investment decisions we've made, and we have been approached on almost all of those specialty businesses, those verticals and essentially, the same in the regions as well. So we're seeing business come to us -- business opportunities come to us via a number of avenues, sometimes directly in the management, sometimes through colleagues, but very seldom in the last year and a half have we used a recruiting firm for any of our new colleagues and these investments. So there is a list of areas that we've maintained over the years that we have explored. We continue to update that list if we happen to have an approach going forward that we think makes sense or we see an opportunity that makes sense, we will look to pursue that. So we are not at the end of an investment cycle. Having said that, we have significant momentum now and confidence in our growth and the potential, because so many of these are relatively new to continue to press forward and we intend to do that and we'll talk more about it at the upcoming IR Day on February 6. But we're performing exceptionally well. We have momentum. The last -- I think, it would be a mistake to pull back prematurely and I believe, we're going to see more opportunity again in '25. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a follow up. I know it's an off-cycle year for category for banks on the stress test. I'm wondering, how you feel about participating this year and readdressing that stress capital buffer? Zach Wasserman : Yes, Erika, this is Zach. I'll take that one. Our stress capital buffer right now is at the minimum, 2.5% and so, which we were pleased to see. Erika Najarian : So you'll leave it alone. Got it. Zach Wasserman : Clarifying to that, I think, we'll leave that one alone. We run internal stress tests every single year. It's a very rigorous process. We continue to feel very, very good about the ability for the capital base to withstand stress environments as we go from here. Steve Steinour : Yes, because as you saw a year and a half ago, the quality of the deposit franchise, the absolute amount of insured to total on the backup facilities that Zach and our treasury team have put in place gives us just a unique position of confidence combined with capital and stable credit, excuse me, notwithstanding challenges at that moment. We remain very confident in our credits as you've heard and we'll run the stress test and, obviously, review output carefully and we're in a period where there's more geopolitical volatility, et cetera, but we think our capital and overall position is very strong and when we look at capital plus reserves, we're top tier. Erika Najarian : Excellent. Thank you. Steve Steinour : Thank you, Erika. Operator : Thank you. We're showing time for one final question. The final question today is coming from Brian Foran of Truist. Please go ahead. Brian Foran : Hi, I was just trying to wrap my head around provisioning for and reserve build first release in '25, and I know under CECL, it's almost impossible to forecast and guide with any kind of precision. But can you just talk about like where you're, on the one hand, you got a reserve for loan growth, which is pretty good. On the other hand, I didn't realize it till just now, but I mean, your criticized assets are now down 20% over nine months and your reserve is pretty high versus peers while your charge-offs are pretty low. But kind of where do you see the puts and takes? I mean, should we think about dollars of reserve release in '25 or is it more about provision that brings the ratio down, but is a stable reserve in dollars or just kind of any kind of central tendency that you would give us on, whether we should be thinking about reserve release build or somewhere in between? Zach Wasserman : Yes. Brian, great question. This is Zach. I'll take that. And if you think about our reserve, just take a kind of step back and frame it strategically and then I'll zoom in a little bit more tactically and answer some of -- the most of your questions. But strategically, the goal for us is to always maintain a very rigorous and robust reserve. Really, as Steve just noted a second ago, not only protection against credit scenarios, but also in a better form of capital. So we feel really good about where the reserve has been and if we look across the arc of time, when we -- look, at CECL day 1, our credit reserve was 1.70%. In the kind of worst period of COVID, that had risen to around 2.3% of our memory reserves made in the early part of 2020. You know, when much of the industry pretty rapidly reduced those reserves in 2021. We also reduced them somewhat, but nowhere near at the same pace, because we knew that the economic environment was still somewhat unsettled and had a lot to play out as ultimately came to pass and so, put us in a really strong position. With that being said, we always expected that as the economic uncertainties that have really been out there for the last couple of years, will there be a soft landing, will there be a hard landing, will there be no landing at all? What will be the kind of the trajectory of the interest rate environment and even the political environment uncertainties? As those would resolve, there would be an opportunity if those results favorably as they ultimately have been doing to reduce reserves and also fundamentally to watch the performance of the book, which has been really good and so what you've seen, for example, last four quarters is a gradual and modest release of reserves -- reserve ratio, even as we've actually maintained dollars or increased dollars at the loan growth, but as the loan portfolio grew. So where we stand today, 188 is obviously higher than that CECL day 170, presuming that the economy continues to perform well, that the outlooks continue to be solid and particularly, given the loan growth we expect to see, it is not improbable to see that ACL coverage ratio as a percent continue to go down even if the dollars might be flat to higher given loan growth. So that's sort of how I think about it strategically. To your point, we look at this quarter by quarter by quarter, it really is an extraordinarily rigorous analysis. There's no predetermination of any of that. We're going to see the world play out on each quarter. But assuming that everything continues to play out as we're talking about, I would assume that over time there will be further reduction in the ACL coverage ratio and we'll continue to drive loan growth higher, so the dollars may be more flat to growing, but the ratio would likely decline. Brian Foran : That's awesome. If I could sneak one last one in. I get a lot of questions about if M&A kind of eases, will Huntington be a buyer? And I would say with the context, there's three or four other regional banks, five or six even that I cover who I get the same question. So it's not unique to you. But maybe, you could just remind us where you are in terms of deal mode, attractive, unattractive right now, on the priority list, not on the priority list. Certainly appreciate you've shown the ability to grow organically and there's a lot on your plate there, but it is something that comes up a lot. Steve Steinour : Brian, it's Steve, great question. I was wondering when this might come up. We've said over the years that we're very focused on driving top-quartile organic growth. We've just made a significant number of investments and in the core as well as what we talk about with these regional expansions and eight verticals, so the core also is getting a fair amount of investment in. And we're managing expense, Zach has shared this over time, reducing core expense as -- on a continuous basis through a number of actions and yet investing over, so there's a net expense growth. We really like this equation. We believe we have significant core opportunity of growth as well as with these new investments and we're very focused on that. The business is performing exceptionally well. And we've shown the ability over time to be able to do, I think, in the last decade, two bolt-on depository acquisitions and we're thrilled with Capstone and they just had a record quarter. So, there is a capacity to do things, but the priority is organic growth. And we're -- as we've said before, we're highly disciplined in the selection. TCF was a home run near $500 million of expense reduction, big revenue generation synergies and some great businesses along with great colleagues. So if it makes sense, we would look, but our priority to be very clear is organic growth. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. That brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Steinour for closing comments. Steve Steinour : So in closing, our team just delivered exceptional results for the fourth quarter and highlighted by our leading loan and deposit growth and record fee income. Our credit trends, as you saw, remain stable. We're very pleased with the overall risk management disciplines we have had in place now for years. Our management team is focused. We're executing our strategies that I've shared earlier, and we expect to sustain the growth momentum into '25 and beyond that we just illustrated. We look forward to sharing more details on the growth outlook during our upcoming Investor Day on February 6. We hope many of you will be able to join us in person for this event. As a reminder, collectively, the Board executives and our colleagues are top 10 shareholder, and we believe this strong alignment is important to sustaining value creation for all shareholders and second, finally, thank you to all my colleagues. Just you did an outstanding job, great quarter. So for those on the call, we're out -- we're grateful for your interest in Huntington, have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",
