My name is Estadon and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. Michael Scarpelli : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our Chief Executive Officer. Our press release and a simultaneous broadcast of this call can be accessed at our website at investors.servicenow.com. We may make forward-looking statements on this conference call, such as those using the words may, will, expects, believes or similar phrases to convey that information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman : Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. We\u2019re off to a great start in 2014 with strong execution and enterprise demand for ServiceNow. Revenues grew 62% year-on-year to a $139 million and billings grew 64% year-on-year to a $181 million. Our installed base is now at 2195 accounts with 426 Global 2000 customers. Global 2000 accounts added in the quarter include Bombardier, BP, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Thomson Reuters, Visa and Wal-Mart. We continue to see deeper and broader penetration of the large enterprise. Our average annual deal size for both new customers and upsells increased year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter. We booked a record nine new transactions with annual contract value in excess of $1 million. The quarter also witnessed the two largest annual transactions in our company\u2019s history, one of which had a total contract value in excess of $10 million. These increases are attributed to customers deploying as an enterprise service management platform, while IT service management usually as the catalyst for transactions. The largest transactions are driven by a much broader enterprise scope. Building on our considerable presence in large pharma, AstraZeneca made a substantial investment in ServiceNow to execute on a global surface management model. They will deploy ServiceNow to consolidate their global IT services providing users with a consumer style self-service experience. AstraZeneca then planned to deploy the service model into other demand such as finance and facilities. Another Global 2000 company chose ServiceNow can deliver service automation for their organization. They are in immediate need for an HR case and knowledge management solution that allowed us to demonstrate the broad applicability of service management in the enterprise. This initial transaction will enable service delivery for a 150,000 employees. Starting with IT and HR the company as a global deployment across other service domains. The usability and agility of our platform was decisive in winning the contract with an annualized value of approximately $4 million. The larger and broader upfront investments we saw in the quarter further reflect in the price wide adoption of ServiceNow. Before closing, please note our upcoming Annual Users Conference Knowledge14, in San Francisco, April 27 through May 1. 6,000 professional and ServiceNow experts will be coming for five days to share service management strategies and learn how others are achieving success in the enterprise. As a part of the event, we will be holding financial analyst day on April 28th, for which many of you on the call today are already registered. Those who cannot join our Analyst Day in person, we will hold a webcast of the event on our Investor Relations website. This event is not to be missed by anyone who is an investor in ServiceNow or contemplated in becoming one. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, frank. We\u2019d like to point out as the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise with the exception of revenue numbers which are GAAP. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP results and GAAP results please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases all of which are posted on website at investors.servicenow.com. Total revenues for the quarter were $139.1 million, growing 62% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Subscription revenues for the quarter were 117.4 million representing 64% year-over-year growth and 12% sequential growth. This growth was driven by strong bookings in prior quarters coupled with a retention rate of 97% in the current quarter. 34% of our annual contract value signed in the quarter came from upsells in our existing customer base. Our average contract terms for new customer upsells and renewals were 36, 23.2 and 24.2 months respectively, compared to an average of 34.3, 24 and 25.6 months on a trailing four quarters basis, respectively. Professional services and other revenues were $21.7 million for the quarter, growing 51% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Over the past few quarters, we have seen the revenue mix of professional services and other decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to focus on strengthening and supporting our growing professional services partner ecosystem. Our trailing 12-month revenue per customer was 241,000, an increase of 22% from the prior year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Our average total annualized contract value Global 2000 customers was 572,000 at the end of the quarter up 31% from the prior year and up 12% from the prior quarter. Total revenues based on geography were $95.0 million in North America, $36.3 million in EMEA and $7.8 million in the rest of the world representing 68%, 26% and 6% of total revenues respectively, compared to 70%, 24% and 6% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2013. Our total billings were $180.8 million in the quarter compared to $110.3 million in the prior year and $166.2 million in the prior quarter, representing 64% year-over-year growth and 9% sequential growth. Additionally approximately 4% of our billings in the quarter were for periods greater than one year, compared to 7% in the prior year and 5% in the prior quarter. In the future, we expect approximately 5% of our billings will be for periods greater than one year, one year is a typical billings term. Before we turn to expenses, we\u2019d like to point out that we ended the quarter with 2,103 employees, an increase of 834 employees from the same period in the prior year and an increase of 273 employees from the prior quarter. We would also like to note, we recorded a pretax amount of $29.2 million related to stock-based compensation expense and $7.1 million in expenses related to our convertible debt. This impacted our earnings per share in the first quarter by a tax adjusted amount of $0.22 per diluted and basic share. Our subscription gross profit was $89.3 million, representing a gross margin of 76%, compared to 77% in the prior year and 78% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 40 employees to subscription cost of sales, ending the quarter with 381 employees. Our professional services and other gross profit was $2.2 million, representing a gross margin of 10%, compared to 8% in the prior year and 13% in the prior quarter.

Sales and marketing expenses were $60.4 million or 43% of revenues, compared to $34.2 million or 40% of revenues in the prior year and $50.5 million or 40% of revenues in the prior quarter. In the first quarter, we incurred $2.7 million in expense associated with our annual sales kickoff event. It is important to note that in the second quarter of 2014 we expect to incur expenses in sales and marketing of approximately $15 million related to knowledge up from $8.3 million incurred for the event in the second quarter of 2013 due to a significant increase in the size of the event. During the quarter, we added 115 employees to sales and marketing, ending the quarter with 730 employees. Research and development expenses were $23.3 million or 17% of revenues, compared to $12.9 million or 15% of revenues in the prior year and $18.7 million or 15% of revenues in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 58 employees to research and development, ending the quarter with 410 employees. General and administrative expenses were $14.8 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $9.9 million or 12% of revenues in the prior year and $13.3 million or 11% of revenues in the prior quarter.

Our basic weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 142.1 million. If we had operated at a net profit in the first quarter, diluted weighted shares outstanding would have been approximately 161.4 million. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 172.3 million, excluding any shares potentially diluted on the conversion of our convertible notes. During the fourth quarter, we generated $24.2 million in cash flows from operations. We used approximately $11 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $13.2 million in free cash flow. This compares to $4.6 million of free cash flow in the prior year and $20 million in the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with $924.4 million in cash, short-term and long-term investments, an increase of $34.5 million to the prior quarter. Our total deferred revenue balance was $308.5 million at the end of the first quarter, up 16% over the $226.7 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. Let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2014. Please note that our margin guidance is on a non-GAAP basis which excludes stock-based compensation expense.

Our total annual revenues estimate consists of subscription revenues between $545 million and $547 million and professional services and other revenues between $107 million and $110 million. With that operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). It looks like our first question comes from Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you. The first question I had, I just wanted to touch on the sales and marketing headcount adds and it looks like maybe the additions in Q1 were a little higher there, at least where we were, so first question there is \u2013 more than 300 adds still the right level to think about for the year any thought toward changing that target and to the extent that you are adding adds, for the adds that you added last year. What\u2019s the productivity ramp Mike? Michael Scarpelli : Yeah, so as we have mentioned before, we are going to finance the hiring in 2014 somewhat to what we did in 2013. But with that we enter a year with the target, but that target can vary based upon how we see our actual results and ramping reps and one thing that we\u2019re very pleased with is our productivity per ramp rep in Q1 over Q1 2013 increased nicely increased 20% actually. So with that, that gives us the confidence to hire people showing that we can ramp them. Jennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. And then maybe just one for Frank and I know we probably get a lot more on this next week. But I\u2019m just curious if now that that I think we\u2019re a little bit into this \u2013 at least the data or the invitation around with the new share offering just curious if there was any \u2013 any early feedback yet on people starting to use that to exchange framework at all? Frank Slootman : Yeah we\u2019re, as you indicated we\u2019re going to announce that early and demonstrate early into this fully next week at our Knowledge 14 event. But actually this was the single most requested item of last year\u2019s knowledge event. So there has been, this has been anticipated for quite some time we have some really good partners and customers that are early adopters and contributors and early design partners in developing this infrastructure and, we\u2019re in the middle of populating it, most of their own content as well as content coming from customers and partners and we\u2019re pretty excited about the prospectus, but it\u2019s still early going, so we\u2019re going to have a update as we go forward here. Jennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Frank Slootman : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Good afternoon. Frank you mentioned the deal over $10 million, I\u2019m just curious if you could give us the sense if that was from the new and existing customers, if you could just maybe walk through on the deal when you are getting deals that large I would assume that\u2019s kind of an \u2013 all you can need transaction, how do you structure that transaction if you can just give \u2013 couple of more details? And I have a quick follow-up for Mike. Frank Slootman : So that was of course another upsell or repeat that was initial transaction, quite significant. And the important thing was that this is the customer who actually intended last year\u2019s rent and really took very strong notice, our positioning service management as an enterprise platform and really about that notion, which is what sort of dramatically expand it to transaction, it\u2019s not \u2013 you can do any transaction, we believe that in this particular situation, we still have a ton of room up in terms of future expansion and upsize. It\u2019s just because of the positioning our enterprise level, that\u2019s really that creates these deals to a levels that we have not seen previously because the user accounts are so much greater than what they are when you view them, they are in a narrow IT service management\u2019s context. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And just more of a question on the go-to-market, number of companies used Q1 that\u2019s kind of reshuffle and refocus the direction, is there any change this year in terms of your go-to-market and how you are reaching the customers and the distribution model or is it more \u2013 a tweak in terms of how you are having represented to go after this opportunity? Frank Slootman : There is really no fundamentals change, last year we did a lot of fundamental change, right because we really balanced between existing customers and new customer focus on, we are continuing that into this year. What it\u2019s different this year that, we have a greater value of emphasis on populating new service areas internationally. But we are very, very intent on getting into Asia. One-third of the global 2000 is in that hemisphere. So it\u2019s very important for the company to establish itself it takes time to do that. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits \u2013 Raymond James : Michael Turits, I became Italian I like that. Michael Turits, Michael did you commented on any expectations for billings in the next quarter and also on the large deals we had build all of tranches at over time? Michael Scarpelli : So the billings where \u2013 we are not giving any guidance on billings. We give enough information for you guys to calculate billings in your models. And in terms of that large deal the annual contract value is build up front. But that was a multi-year contract. And so it was included in our billings by just one year of that. Michael Turits \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. And then you had \u2013 you talked about rolling out some kind of mid-year or down market product, where are we with that and how does that fit into the kind of market strategy in general? Frank Slootman : This is Frank. That\u2019s a product that we refer to as ServiceNow business edition. We have been running it in tests, now we have a half dozen paying customers on that platform. And what we are really heavily in a mode of getting the product right, giving the support model correct, the contract model and so on. It really is a mid-market product. Those are bunch of things that we learned in the process that were actively dealing with. That we expect to really scale and broaden we go-to-market effort around that product in the second half of the year. We are not in that rush to get that think to market. We are selling it. We are able to sell it that we are not stepping on the pedal until we feel really ready to do that. It\u2019s a very different approach than what you get in the enterprise side of ServiceNow you really scale down market in ever dimension of the product itself. Michael Scarpelli : And I will also add Mike, we do not include the business edition product in our customer ads because those customers ads would give our enterprise customers. Michael Turits \u2013 Raymond James : And I have one follow up on that billing for that that\u2019s always $10 million deal any sense kind of what you said exactly how many years, what portion that $10 million was a contribution to billings this quarter? Michael Scarpelli : So that was a multi-year contract and that was a three year contract with some professional services in that and it was just under $4 million is what the contribution of the length was. Michael Turits \u2013 Raymond James : This quarter? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Michael Turits \u2013 Raymond James : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks. Frank and Mike, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a bit about your descendents around upsell versus new \u2013 you saw a great billings and the customer account increased year-over-year or the incremental customer can increase year-over-year. But you are adding about same customers as you were a year ago, I\u2019m just wondering, how you are thinking about those two drivers of your growth both this year and then beyond this year? Frank Slootman : It\u2019s good question. Walt its Frank. The important think, if we have to realize, we do not measure or incentivize or hold accountable or sales organization \u2013 put a number of ads. I mean we start managing that way. We get a very different model in terms of how people try to connect with the business. The organization has been very, very successful in connecting with the contract values and they are doing sort of that in a way that really optimizes the result and what you are seeing is the most optimal model for us to report this kind of results. Now, are they naturally gravitating toward the large enterprise apparently yes. So for sure I guess the large upsell on the large enterprise where we are the most productive in terms of deploying our sales people. Now, are we keeping an eye on this particular issue, we absolutely are. And we are looking for ways of balancing that out. But we are not going to be hard over. I mean without managing the world goes per se not all the accounts were created equal. I mean that\u2019s an understatement by the way because you are some [indiscernible] large versus the domains when you go market, you now become far more insignificant. So that is how we are thinking about it. So we are looking to balance it a little bit but we are super freeze with the bookings performance of our sales organization on the last several quarters. The last thing we want to do is metric some that works extraordinarily well for us. Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citigroup: Got it. And then Frank related to that, I\u2019m wondering when you entered your heart of the developers, and if you [indiscernible] occur in that market. I\u2019m wondering on the upsell success you are seeing, is it possible to talk about what areas of IT, headcounts or the organization you are doing a better job in penetrating the trend in terms of what are you seeing this quarter here? Frank Slootman : Well, that\u2019s also good say, particularly inflection this quarter that\u2019s different from other quarters. In the main thrust of ServiceNow in the marketplace and we see it in action and we see it working is that we are really expanding people\u2019s perspective of service management from an IT context to an enterprise context. I mean that\u2019s what our customers are looking at and that\u2019s what they are moving into some kinds of doing IT plus HR or plus some specific applications other times they would be really going hook line and tinker and really are viewing it much on a global level and its really up to us as a sales and marketing organization to make the case for that. But I think what you\u2019re seeing is that we are increasingly more successful in doing that. We super excited about that because that I s main mission of the company to make that transformation in the marketplace from IT service models to enterprise service models. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo : Frank, can you talk a little bit more about your non-ITSM or service desk sales cycle and maybe as you continue to penetrate these accounts what are you seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics just some of it guidance moving from do it yourself to onto your platform? Are you seeing other competitors? And how does that just impact what your reps are communicating to customers out in the field? Thanks. Frank Slootman : It\u2019s Frank here, Jason. The really, really important thing to understand is there is not a separate sales model or sales approach or message for ITSM versus non-ITSM. We don\u2019t make that distinction. Service now is one platform. It is a platform that holds service management applications. IT is just one specific variant, one specific instantiation of that service model. So our people go to market with that message. We are pitching one thing, not two things. It is true to ITSM is usually the starting point with people replacing a lot of legacy systems, but our whole goal with the customer is to really expand their view, the opportunity of what\u2019s possible, right, that\u2019s the game we\u2019re playing after we\u2019re increasingly more successful of that. So we don\u2019t sort of go banging around opening the door at facilities, one at procurement one at HR, we really go in through the front door, we use the IT organization as our lining post, if you will, and then we are advocated by IT into the larger enterprise. And that\u2019s sort of a very, very unique strategy, that has relative to the enterprise as opposed to trying to breaking doors open with various departments throughout the enterprise. So we\u2019re landing in IT and then we are literally advocated into the balance of the enterprise through that organization. That\u2019s how we operate. Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo : What do you see though from say maybe a when you get to that non-IT who is looking at the platform any date yet that you can scorch on? Frank Slootman : Yeah, we see differences for example between HR and IT. We\u2019ve done a lot of IT and HR implementation that\u2019s probably the service model that we are most familiar outside of IT. And they\u2019re actually very different. The HR people are very information centric. So they\u2019re really focused knowledge management and so on whereas IT service models are very much focused on defects and things that are not working. So the service models are different and the issues that people are focusing on in the mitigation strategies are different in these service domains. We expect that, right. Every service demand is a little bit different that are fundamentally deploying a very, very similar type of service model. From a comparative standpoint, sometimes when we go after sort of the spoke applications we may run to another platform player out there like Force but most of the time when we are really selling service management for the enterprise there really is not sort of a comparative confrontation. We are the only people out there that are really driving enterprise service management as an IT strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, it\u2019s actually Chris [indiscernible]. I just wanted to touch base on the shift that you are seeing and you commented on it, Mike, and the call of the service break that shift into partners. Obviously with the growth that you guys are experiencing, a lot of work that the partners are getting and we spoke to a couple that actually your highest designation this quarter. I mean, they are struggling to find capacity to get deals implemented. How are you managing that as the business is growing just rapidly as it is and you want to obviously shift a lot of that to partners given the opportunity but at the same time making sure that there is enough capacity in place of the ecosystem to get \u2013 to get deals done? Frank Slootman : This is Frank, Chris. This has been a perennial challenge for a business like ServiceNow that\u2019s being growing for ever at the rate. So the discount is scarcely a resource as long as we are growing \u2013 it\u2019s not going to go away, right. We see partners growing talent, there is a lot of talent coming out of customer organizations and moving to the other side. So there is a lot of that ejection going on. But fundamentally, I mean, obviously, we are adding a lot of talent industry, we have a very significant training activity, so we are training a ton of people, our own people but we are also training a ton of people among our customers as well as part of the community. I mean one of the big things of knowledge or conference that starts next week. It is a gigantic training event. And that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people to the conference. So we are literally developing skills and experience and talent as fast as we can. Important thing to notice, we are really very careful not to crowd out our ecosystem and to create ample room for our partners to develop their business. We have no goal of our own to grow the services businesses to a certain size, actually was their business to enable success with our customers and to enable the success for our partners. We don\u2019t need our service business to be any bigger than it needs to be to meet that objective because now as everybody can tell it is a drag on the profit profile of the company as a whole. So we are actually sort of quite pleased where it is in relative trends as well as others as a percentage of the total business. While we are going to stay there not really depends on whether we are meeting our objectives and enabling customers and partners out there. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. And then the one quick follow-up, one thing that we have heard, just from talking to some of those partners, specifically some that are maybe a little bit smaller, is that they are seeing \u2013 they have reach into customers and existing relationship with some more mid-market customers and they see a potential need for a mid-market solution. It\u2019s some of that the push to introduce business addition, are you seeing some of that demand from partners or that maybe one-off conversations that we are having? Frank Slootman : Well, this is a business actually product is built to require a very little services. If any that\u2019s the whole point. I mean we should be able to deploy that in hours and days is the idea. If we have to add real professional services to that product definitely it\u2019s going to defeat the product cost of it economically, it will make a whole lot of sense. So that good position is really going after mid-market. It\u2019s much more of a turnkey product and sticky and go and that\u2019s the whole idea behind it. Unidentified Analyst : And you would be just able to just sell that directly you wouldn\u2019t need any pointers involved at all essentially is what the implications to that or I take it? Frank Slootman : Don\u2019t have to but we certainly won\u2019t mind having partners in the mix. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. Rob Owens \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : Yes. Thank you and good afternoon gentlemen. Couple of questions for staff, as you are seeing deals sizes increase materially and customers leverage the platform for increasing applications, what kind of customer pressure is there to do ELAs and what is your attitude towards ELAs? Frank Slootman : A good question Rob. I mean we are getting mostly first four ELAs mostly because customers doing wealth managing compliance didn\u2019t want to count users and having to sort of manage the top relation its sort of a easy to use feature. We have done a number of those kinds of transactions. It\u2019s not that all you can need to know typically, I would just like to \u2013 so many users really good boundaries, you want how many users and we defined the functionality that was licensed to them for a certain period of time. And then they don\u2019t have to manage complaints during that period of time but eventually of course we are back to removing upsell process and so on, so that relationship gets reset. We are very open to doing them. But obviously, we are going into those deals with our eyes open and we have to also detect our downsides and deals like that. We don\u2019t give away the store. So it\u2019s a bit of push and pull there in terms of what the customer wants and that we need to get out of it to protect our side. Rob Owens \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : And then you talked a little bit about transitions service management from an IT context to an enterprise context, you have talked in the past about moving to HR and financials, are you seeing any applications written for the external community or external customers, so not enterprise facing, actually customer facing and any examples would be great? Frank Slootman : Yes. Absolutely. I\u2019d say that\u2019s going to the customer-facing side is usually not sort of in the first place where customers know that we have a kind of examples and spend any time at Knowledge next week you\u2019ll be confronted with them that we have won the medical equipment manufacturer, for example in Europe they\u2019re actually using the CMDB not to store information about IT infrastructure but actually about their actual machines, MRI machines and so on. And they use ServiceNow for all the doctors and nurses in the hospital use these machines to interact with them just to manufacture to provide the service model around it, that\u2019s now a typical application, we fund over GNSG energy we talked about them in the past turbines and power plants. So those are examples and almost every hard and soft assets, what I want to say, it has a service model around it whether people are managing the service is not a question that use their service model and every asset has challenges it has problems, it has defects, it has questions around information, it has claims, it has warranties. So all these service models that exist have to be implemented and they are customer-facing and that\u2019s definitely part of the business that we\u2019re in and that we\u2019re going to be in more so going forward. Michael Scarpelli : Actually one of their customers on the panel at our Analyst Day Getty Images. They have a customer-facing, I didn\u2019t talk about, you have a chance to talk to them at our Analyst Day next week. Rob Owens \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : Great. Appreciate the colors. Thanks, guys. Frank Slootman : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore: Thanks very much. I guess Frank, maybe some more related to Rob\u2019s question. When you go and your talks with your partners right now it seems like a lot of them are building some templates on top of your platform right now. But I\u2019m just kind of curious how far how do you think it is before you start to see people building sort of standalone applications that are built from a one to many on a one to many basis. Really that\u2019s early but it seems like you\u2019re going that way and some partners they built SRN showcases and things like that. So, I guess I\u2019m just curious if is that something you think it start to occur over the next year or two or is it just too far out to start to think about that right now? Frank Slootman : No, Kirk, I think we all going to start to see that, one of the things that we\u2019ve done with a launch of the show the structure is exactly for that appropriate show because it\u2019s one thing for us to enable our platform for external developers to build apps that can be sold over and over but we got to give them loves to market right and we have some loves to market certainly that conference is our \u2013 but having to share infrastructure allows them to really host content and that can be exposed to ourselves as a customer\u2019s out there. So, it\u2019s really because we\u2019re at a platform so when they\u2019re saying certainly they to sell the app to people that are running to show in our platform. Now maybe a triggers the sale of the platform but to the real nice love to market for truthfully software developers is selling in to the market that we already have, people are already are in shortlist now. So, I definitely it\u2019s a focus area for us, it\u2019s important for us and I definitely think we\u2019re going to start seeing that and in the second half of this year and years to come. Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore: Yes. And then just second question, just around the bigger the nine deals over a million. I guess was there any sort of commonality in terms of you mentioned the one large deal is over a end user. I guess of the existing customers was it mainly functionality expansion user, expansion I really which one might be somewhat unique so there might not be any sort of commentaries but I was just kind of curious if there isn\u2019t anything you are seeing happening within the bigger deals that you\u2019re signing? Thanks. Frank Slootman : No. I don\u2019t think there was anything in social and inflection and things get sort of biggest interest and they needed the types of deals that we\u2019ve been doing all along that this getting bigger and bigger and sort of spoken about the 7 figure line and as I said earlier, it is because we\u2019re driving a larger scope for the platform as will drives up these yield size a different terms of composition they are somewhat to what they were before. Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :-Yes. Thanks guys. You clearly you guys are the leader in the ITSM market and there is obviously a lot of talk on how you guys are going to expand beyond IT. But, how do you think about penetrating other areas of IT perhaps like an application performance management area? Frank Slootman : Yes. So, Matt this is something that we will actually be talking and demonstrating brand new software next week at our conference, the IT Operations management market is a market that\u2019s very closely aligned to the IP service management market that, the workflow that exist in service management versus systems management are very, very close and for example on what you\u2019ve done finished and your odd effects that are extremely close cost. So, many of our customers have already integrative our service management systems with their system management infrastructure and we\u2019ve been watching this for quite a while now and we are now beginning to enable the integration of this workflow. So, if you\u2019re not naturally there will be a whole lot of new things that we are going to show in that regard. Matt Hedberg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s great. And then maybe for Mike. Given all the headcount additions you guys have been adding here, is it still safe to assume that we could see breakeven operating margins for the year? Michael Scarpelli : Yes, for the full year, yes. Matt Hedberg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s great. Thanks guys. Michael Scarpelli : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Abhey, your line is open. Okay. Sorry about that. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Maxim Group. Brad Sills \u2013 Maxim Group : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want an ITSM within the existing sweet, are you finding certain services that has gained traction on attach outside of core incident and problem? Frank Slootman : Yes. I mean there is lots of an asset management issue public management has taken off. We\u2019re introducing whole bunch of new applications in our material release that we\u2019re going to be showcasing next week as well as whole bunch of software that we\u2019re releasing at the end of this year, new demand management, general management, problem management, applications, password reset. There is a autonomous stuff there that we do and I mean that the core ITO process is that you just mentioned is something that everybody has and everybody does but our customer base has expanded much beyond that it\u2019s really that motion in our Q4 IT that we talked about previously is really the concept that they\u2019ve think off when they think of show this now more so that in our definition of ITSM. Brad Sills \u2013 Maxim Group : Great. Thanks, Frank. And then just one on the platform. Can you comment a little bit on tax rate in new deals versus renewals are you finding that customers are committing to the platform earlier now whether it\u2019s in year one, year zero or later in the cycle? Frank Slootman : No. I don\u2019t know if I have any subsequent data on that but what I will tell you is that last quarter we talked about the split between ITSM and non ITSM revenue because that time we said it was around 20% of the business was non ITSM and in this quarter it was more like 37%. Michael Scarpelli : 34%. Frank Slootman : 34%. It\u2019s a \u2013 we view them better way that\u2019s for new transactions leaving out the upsales and most... Michael Scarpelli : Including the upsales leaving out the renewals. Frank Slootman : Leaving out the renewals. So, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity. We saw a pretty big jump also in Discovery and old construction this quarter. So, there is just of ton of activity going on outside of the core ITSM functionality. Brad Sills \u2013 Maxim Group : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Tim Klasell \u2013 Northland Securities : Yes. Good afternoon everybody. Just a quick question on share, I don\u2019t want to grab some of the buzz from the conference next week but how would partners monetize? Are you going to leave it up to them to set pricing or is that something that you will have a say in as your partners with content up on share? Frank Slootman : Yes. So, good question. So, share is initially not intended to be really a monetization platform, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called, share is really intended for content to be broadly available to everybody in our community that once you see that. Now, that said anybody that wants to sell content obviously it can\u2019t trans out offline one on one with whoever wants it. So, it\u2019s much more of a marketing vehicle if you will right on a transactional or sales vehicle, it doesn\u2019t exclude us in future from inserting our ourselves into a process with obviously you can\u2019t tend \u2013 gets deployed on any of our customers instances that times to generate internal license revenue for ServiceNow because we are at a one-time platform. Tim Klasell \u2013 Northland Securities : Exactly. And I know in the past you mentioned, you speak IT very well, you have to learn to speak HR and procurement. [indiscernible] it could get into a lot of other departments fairly quickly, do you foresee any challenges and having to learn the lingos of other departments and do you have any plans to address that? Frank Slootman : Yes. It\u2019s an interesting question. And here is the thing. We really believe that service management is the language that we have to real master and be excellent at. And service management is applied to many different demands. And it does vary as I explained earlier between HR and IT sort of different focus area, different definition and they certainly have a different nomenclature. And those kinds of things we have to learn fundamentally, we have to be expert as an organization at managing service \u2013 service models how that works because that\u2019s what we bring to these organizations. When you talk to an HR organization, they don\u2019t really know about service models because they historically have not had them. The only organization that brings that to them and explains how this service model working off right. So that\u2019s our expertise and value add in the process obviously. We do need to learn to speak. That\u2019s more of a terminology nomenclature thing rather than fundamental concepts. Tim Klasell \u2013 Northland Securities : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Greg McDowell \u2013 JMP Securities : Great. Thanks very much. Hi, Mike and Frank. I want to ask you guys about strength in certain verticals you mentioned 9 deals over $1 million. I was just wondering if you saw any particular strength in verticals and are you seeing any verticals starting to pull back on enterprise IT spend? Thanks. Frank Slootman : We are seeing anything really. I mean this has really been strong both geographically diverse as well as in terms of verticals. While we have been really strong eyes in the financial sector, it\u2019s a service model absolute everywhere in the large financial institutions. Also large insurance now. Pharma is exceedingly strong for us like retail. So I think we are very, very broadly represented in terms of verticals. And to goes, we are trying to edge into Europe bigger and bigger every quarter. I mean, now, I think in north of 0.6% of our revenue mix. So that\u2019s our best. We have an enormous amount of room up in Asia we feel. That is a focus area for us. Michael Scarpelli : We have a very good pipeline with some nice size deals in Asia Pacific. Greg McDowell \u2013 JMP Securities : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steven Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much. I just like to circle back to the enterprise deals that you started to do. I was just wondering if you could give us maybe a little color of who is at the table when you are doing those deals. I\u2019m assuming that even if it\u2019s a new customer that IT may be an advocate for you. But are you meeting with the Chief Operating Officer, you are crossing over the line of business side, or you touching those budgets, are the representing, just some general color on how broad the audience is for those enterprise deals? Frank Slootman : Yes. Very interesting question. For the most part we really aimed up in the CIOs office because these transactions are off a size and off a exposure and sensitivity that achieved the most executive in IT is a very key stakeholder. That wasn\u2019t always the case. We often sort of launch \u2013 sort of a level below that have infrastructure and that person is still super, super important in the mix as well. But we are seeing enterprises now where it\u2019s going above IT and IT is just one of the user organizations now of ServiceNow. I mean, we are just seeing the very first evidence of that that\u2019s definitely a new thing. And of course, when you see the contractual commitment they are involved in much large involvement of the broader enterprise that makes total sense that we are moving in that direction. I lost trust even though we are seeing evidence of it. This is still fairly early in that evolution. Steven Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Great. And then in October you made a number of pricing changes and you really trying to accomplish a number of different things. My very high level question is, is that generally worked out the way you would hope and I realized that\u2019s still early. But, are you seeing the kinds of benefits from those changes that you are hoping to see? Frank Slootman : That\u2019s a two-fold answer. When it comes to a new customers, the answer is absolutely, yes. I mean we are this better at monetizing and when I mentioned earlier I were to assume much better revenue contribution from orchestration, discovery. We are upselling very successful as well. Really different customers obviously, it\u2019s always a much taller order during an upside process or renewal process, forget them is to new models that it is one of them, we have to work through that. And sometimes we have to grandfather people in because there is too much friction. But on the whole, we make it true and that\u2019s just part of the business. It\u2019s working for us. But I would certainly say it\u2019s not without friction, but any kind of assurance would bring friction with it. Steven Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird: And real quick Mike, just to clarify did you to the answer to a prior question when I asked about the percentage of business from non-ITSM that you would saw new and upsell average contract value in the fourth quarter was 20% non-ITSM and then this quarter was 34%? Michael Scarpelli : Correct. Steven Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens. Alex Zukin \u2013 Stephens: Hey, guys congratulations on the great quarter. I wanted to ask first just about, are you starting to see any kind of vertical specific applications emerge that are being built on a platform kind of how you are thinking about that going forward? Frank Slootman : Yes. That\u2019s been going on for quite some time. We have seen them in insurance for exception claims handling. That we have seen in the oil and gas for Ocean violation reporting to federal government. I mean there is ton of examples that connectivity going on our eco system, very, very common. Alex Zukin \u2013 Stephens: Got it thanks. And then on the competitive environment just one of the ask if you are seeing any changes is it becoming, or the sales cycles shortening because you are now looked out at as more of a standard bearer in the space? Frank Slootman : Well, that shortens the sales into half, you are right. We are seeing as the attribute to platform, but and the relationships are viewed bigger and more strategic. You get more players in the game and sometimes as we \u2013 the opposite effect or sales cycles and contracts are viewed within immense amount of scrutiny as well because people know these 10, 15 years decision, right. So having a legal complex with these relationships is exceedingly important to them and they are going to spend the time getting it right. So it goes both ways. He is going to trying to tell you. Alex Zukin \u2013 Stephens: Understood. Thanks guys. Frank Slootman : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Harris Heyer with Credit Suisse. Harris Heyer \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m calling on behalf of Phil. Just had a quick question, you talked a little bit about pricing, can you give us an update in terms of the kind of pressing dynamics from a competitive standpoint and what you are seeing from HP or BMC? Michael Scarpelli : Well, Frank I don\u2019t take it a whole lot, I mean like the HP and BMC, if they are willing to let it go almost for zero dollars just to keep people like us out of the accounts because we are not as disruptive to the business in terms of ITSM. But also brings downstream like IT operations management stuff I talked about earlier. So surprising it\u2019s not a factor, I mean the problem that the incumbents and the legacy vendors have they have no products. So price becomes pretty relevant if you don\u2019t have products. Harris Heyer \u2013 Credit Suisse : All right. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. Derrick Wood \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : Great. Thanks. I wanted to touch back on the 34% figure. Are you seeing any change in the type of vendor or technologies you are displacing as you are kind of moving beyond core ITSM or is it more of mix of greater mix of greenfield? Frank Slootman : This is Frank. It\u2019s a much greater focus on greenfield, I mean you move it to HR. They know how to handle this thing. They just had email. They had the Excel. They had Microsoft Access. They really had Lotus Notes, right? That\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s being replaced. It\u2019s like absolute nothing or some mix shift representation of some kind of a surface model, its mostly message base. So we are very much replacing really labor or substituting really labor for systems here. These are brand new things for a lot of these organization. They never had service management system in the service domains before. And of course, it\u2019s really, really impactful when you see HR organizations implement service model all of a sudden. The insight that they get in their workloads that they can do about it. IT has left this life for some time. They understand. They have matured. They are very adoptive. You get outside of IT, it\u2019s a completely new world for this people out there that\u2019s what we find so exciting about our business is introduce these concept to move service domains. Derrick Wood \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : That\u2019s great. Thanks. And then Mike, given the broader aspect of your platform today, should we expect contract sizes with initial wins that\u2019s start trending higher or you still door focused on this learn and expand model? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. We are still very much focused on the learn and expand, but with that said our average initial transactions size has continued to increase quarter-over-quarter. And we think they are trying to continue focusing on the enterprise not including the business edition product. Derrick Wood \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the back over to Michael Scarpelli. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investor section of our Web site as well as through the dialing instructions contained in today\u2019s earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing many of you next week.",

My name is Denise, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now hand the conference over to Mr. Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed. Michael P. Scarpelli: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our Chief Executive Officer. Our press release and a simultaneous broadcast of this call can be accessed at our website at investors.servicenow.com. We may make forward-looking statements on this conference call such as those using the words may, will, expects, believes or similar phrases to convey that information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We are very pleased with our performance during the quarter. Revenues grew 63% year-on-year to $167 million, and billings grew 59% year-on-year to $187 million. This quarter was marked by strong demand from the customer base, with renewals at 98% and upsells at 33% of annual contract values signed in the quarter as well as strong new account contributions. Our installed base is now 2,364 accounts with 455 Global 2000 customers. Some of the Global 2000 accounts added in the quarter include Eni, an integrated energy company; HGST, a Western Digital company; QBE Insurance Group, one of the world's largest insurance and reinsurance companies; Avago Technologies, a leading semiconductor company; and CONSOL Energy, a producer of natural gas and coal. Our strategy to enable the service-oriented enterprise continues to gain traction with customers and prospects. We're seeing good momentum [ph] of our platform in service domains outside of enterprise IT. Our HR service automation application has seen good uptick since we released the product last year, totaling 23 transactions in the second quarter alone. One of these was an upsell to a North American insurance fund. Their lack of a centralized HR service model inundated the group with questions and requests by phone and email. Advocated by the IT team, ServiceNow was selected to implement HR case and knowledge management for their 5,000 employees. Another case in point, a Global 2000 insurance company chose ServiceNow to provide their 25,000 users with a modern HR case management solution. This deployment was driven by a broader initiative to improve business process efficiency such as reducing the thousands of inbound calls to Human Resources. The IT team at this company advocated the use of ServiceNow and drove the first platform demonstration and assisted in the campaign from start to finish. In other service areas, a global rental car company built a custom application on ServiceNow that allows the IT team to align and prioritize business demands with required resources, budgets and overall strategy. The IT team is now working with our finance counterparts to automate and track their supplier interactions with a modern and consumer-like service experience using ServiceNow to manage things like invoice and order issues. A recent CIO survey by Morgan Stanley further illustrates our platform momentum as approximately 30% of the CIOs polled plan to use ServiceNow as a platform by the end of 2015, a nearly 50% increase from their previous survey in January 2014. A few things propel our business more than customer success and community. Our Knowledge conference this year in San Francisco broke all records, with more than 6,500 attendees, including more than 100 CIOs from global enterprises. It is a true industry event with more than 90% of the content delivered by customers and partners. Earlier this month, we acquired Neebula Systems for approximately $100 million in an all-cash transaction. Neebula's flagship product, ServiceWatch, automates the discovery, mapping and monitoring of IT-enabled enterprise services. It is a fundamental transformation from component-centric management to one that puts the service portfolio front and center. This solution will become a centerpiece of our IT operations management strategy and it strengthens our position to capture more of the $19 million ITOM market. Thus far, we have received strong positive feedback from customers, partners and investors on the acquisition. And finally, we welcome 2 new members to our Board of Directors, Sue Bostrom, most recently the Chief Marketing Officer at Cisco; and Anita Sands, recently the Group Managing Director, Head of Change Leadership and a member of the Wealth Management Americas Executive Committee at UBS Financial Services. Both bring significant corporate leadership, industry and management experience to our board. With that, I want to turn the call over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. I'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP results and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. Total revenues for the second quarter were $166.8 million, growing 63% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Subscription revenues for the quarter were $132.7 million, representing 65% year-over-year growth and 13% sequential growth. Our average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals were 31.9, 25.6 and 28.5 months, respectively, compared to an average of 34.0, 24.0 and 26.7 months on a trailing 4-quarter basis, respectively. Professional services and other revenues were $34.0 million for the quarter, growing 56% year-over-year and 57% sequentially. Our second quarter includes $8.2 million in registration sponsorship revenue from Knowledge, our annual users conference. This compares to $5.0 million in revenue from Knowledge in the second quarter of 2013. Our average total revenue per customer was approximately $262,000, an increase of 21% from the prior year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Our average annualized contract value for Global 2000 customers was $583,000 at the end of the quarter, up 67% from the prior year and up 13% from the prior quarter. Total revenues based on geography were $114.3 million in the Americas, $42.2 million in EMEA and $10.3 million in Asia Pacific, representing 69%, 25% and 6% of total revenues, respectively, compared to 70%, 24% and 6% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2013. Our total billings were $187.1 million in the quarter compared to $117.5 million in the prior year and $180.8 million in the prior quarter, representing 59% year-over-year growth and 3% sequential growth. Additionally, approximately 3% of our billings in the quarter were for periods greater than 1 year compared to 12% in the prior year and 4% in the prior quarter. In the future, we expect less than 5% of our billings will be for periods greater than 1 year. One year is our typical billings term. Our subscription gross profit was $103.3 million, representing a gross margin of 78% compared to 77% in the prior year and 76% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 24 employees to subscription cost of sales, ending the quarter with 405 employees. Our professional services and other gross profit was $11.6 million, representing a gross margin of 34% compared to 33% in the prior year and 10% in the prior quarter. It is important to note that professional services and other revenues include $8.2 million from our Knowledge event with all expenses related to the event running through sales and marketing, providing a boost to gross margins that we will see once a year on the quarter we hold in the event. Excluding Knowledge, our non-GAAP professional services gross margins were 13% compared to 10% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 33 employees to professional services and other cost of sales, ending the quarter with 370 employees. Our total gross profit was $114.9 million, representing a gross margin of 69% compared to 68% in the prior year and 66% in the prior quarter. Excluding $8.2 million in revenue from our Knowledge event, non-GAAP gross margin was 67% in the quarter. Our operating margin in the second quarter and in the prior year was negative 4% and a negative 5% in the prior quarter. Sales and marketing expenses included $15.3 million related to our Knowledge event. During the quarter, we added 76 employees to sales and marketing, ending the quarter with 806 employees; 60 employees to research and development, ending the quarter with 470 employees; and 32 employees to general and administrative, ending the quarter with 277 employees. Net loss for the second quarter was $9.8 million or a net loss of $0.07 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $7.8 million or a net loss of $0.06 per basic and diluted share in the prior year and a net loss of $11.7 million or a net loss of $0.08 per basic and diluted share in the prior quarter. Our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 144.5 million. If we had operated at a net profit in the second quarter, diluted weighted average shares outstanding would have been approximately 161 million. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter, assuming the treasury stock method, were 169.8 million, excluding any potentially diluted shares from the conversion of our convertible notes. During the second quarter, we generated $42.1 million in cash flow from operations. We used approximately $16.4 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $25.6 million in free cash flow. The strong free cash flow in the quarter was positively impacted one time by collections, which slipped from Q1 into Q2, and the delay of payments at the end of Q2 into Q3 due to timing of our check run. This compares to a negative $2.1 million of free cash flow in the prior year and positive $13.2 million in the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with $957.1 million in cash, short-term and long-term investments, an increase of $32.7 million over the prior quarter. Our total deferred revenue balance was $328.9 million at the end of the second quarter, up 7% over the $308.5 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with 2,328 employees, an increase of 885 employees from the same period in the prior year and an increase of 225 employees from the prior quarter. Let's turn to guidance for the third quarter and the remainder of the year, which includes the impact of Neebula. Please note that our margin guidance is on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles. For the third quarter 2014, we expect total revenues between $173 million and $175 million, representing year-over-year growth between 55% and 57%. Our total third quarter revenue estimate consists of subscription revenues between $147 million and $148 million and professional services and other revenues between $26 million and $27 million. We expect Neebula to have an immaterial impact on our third quarter revenue results. We expect billings between $190 million and $193 million, representing year-over-year growth between 50% and 52%. We expect subscription gross margin of approximately 77%, professional services and other gross margins of approximately 8% and overall gross margin of approximately 66%. We expect an operating margin of approximately 1%. As a result of Neebula, we expect a negative 1% impact to our operating margin and to pay up to $15 million in capital gains tax to integrate Neebula into our global tax structure in the third quarter. For full year 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $668 million to $657 million (sic) [$673 million], representing year-over-year growth of 58%. Our total annual revenues estimate consists of subscription revenues between $558 million and $560 million and professional services and other revenues between $110 million and $113 million. We expect Neebula to have an immaterial impact to our full year 2014 revenue results. As a result of the Neebula acquisition, we acquired 29 employees and expect to add another 30 employees by the end of the year. With that, operator, we can now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. James Wesman : It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Mike, a quick question on the Neebula acquisition in your billings guidance. Any impact from Neebula on the $190 million to $193 million figure for the third quarter? Michael P. Scarpelli: No, Neebula is really an immaterial acquisition from a revenue perspective in 2014, including billings. James Wesman : Got it. So immaterial to billings for 2014 as well, I heard you right? Michael P. Scarpelli: Yes. James Wesman : Great. And then just a follow-up for you and Frank. Just a housekeeping question. What percent of the net new annual contract value is from non-ITSM this quarter? I think it was 34% in 1Q. Did you guys give that figure this quarter? Frank Slootman : I think I described -- yes, I think the figure is 32% this quarter. So it's substantially in the same area as it was last quarter. Michael P. Scarpelli: But we'll reiterate again, that is not a metric that we manage the business on because we still have a lot of legacy contracts where there's upsells, where they buy under our old licensing model. So that doesn't accurately capture all of that business. Frank Slootman : Yes. We believe it's an understated metric. Michael P. Scarpelli: I'd also like to correct, when I was giving the full year guidance, the correct number is $668 million to $673 million. I believe I got that wrong. Frank Slootman : Misspoke, yes. Michael P. Scarpelli: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I'd like to focus my questions a little bit on this HR case management opportunity and some of the wins you had in the quarter. Frank, maybe talk a little bit about how you're seeing that materialize in your pipeline and frankly, how repeatable and consistent do you think your sales motions in this area can be over the coming year or so. Frank Slootman : It's actually -- Jason, it's Frank. It has become a pretty substantial sort of pull of activity for us. We highlighted in the prepared remarks how many transactions we've done. But one of the other things we noticed is that the pipeline on HR case management is now larger than what we have around PPM, which is our Project Portfolio Management applications. So it's really sort of rocketing up the pecking order, if you will, in terms of the hot applications that are in demand out there. And it's definitely a sales motion that is becoming more predictable because of the activity, but it's also something that makes a ton of sense. We're learning a lot more about why HR organizations are interested. We know -- we learn how to talk about it. We learn the language of HR better. We're able to point to a lot more references and successes we've had. And it's another one of those areas that is just wide open. HR has lived with email and voice messaging-oriented systems to execute on the service model, and this is just an area where they can book gains in terms of service experience and efficiency really quickly. So we expect this to continue. And the same thing is going on at facilities procurement. Those are the service domains where the IT organizations typically are driving these kind of service efficiencies. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Is there any way to sort of think about initial order size with HR case management and how it would compare to some of the other product areas? And do you anticipate it being bigger or smaller in relative size? Or -- and then I guess would you see a similar ramp in terms of how big these projects can get over time? Frank Slootman : Yes. We probably have to do a little bit more work to attach some authoritative data on there. I'm sure there's data that's there to be had. I just don't have it at my fingertips. I don't want to do a characterization that doesn't reflect what it really is. Anything you want to add to that, Mike? Michael P. Scarpelli: Yes. What I would add is that what the HR case management does for us now, it gives our sales people an opportunity when a customer isn't ready to do an ITSM switch, it's another sales front into those organizations to get our beachhead at HR case management, and we're seeing more and more of that. Frank Slootman : Yes. The other thing I'd tell you is that HR case management is different from IT service management. It tends to be very much focused on knowledge. HR is a very information-centric service model where employees are looking for answers to questions, whereas IT tends to be very defect-oriented. Something's broken and people need help mitigating a situation. So even though the concepts are similar, where it focuses and the type of techniques and approaches they use are actually quite different. And these are the types of things that we're learning, which is really, really helpful when we go into new accounts and we try to explain what this is going to do for them. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Sorry about that. Maybe a little bit more around Neebula. And I understand it's immaterial to the remainder of the year, but just a sense as to what the revenue model look like, maybe how much revenue preexisted at the company, what you're looking to do in terms of integrating into your process. And then I know you're not giving any guidance on the out year, but how excited should we be getting about this opportunity? Frank Slootman : Rob, it's Frank. We're super excited about Neebula, not just because of Neebula as a standalone technology and what it can do, but we think it's going to really help charge the overall ITOM strategy that we have. I mean it's going to help a lot with our Discovery, with our CMDB because it's extremely value added to those technologies. So it's not just an asset and a revenue opportunity in its own right. It will help all the other products that we have in our ITOM portfolio today as well as the ones that we are going to have in the future. This is really a leapfrog. It really tries to sort of set aside what we've been doing for 30 years in this marketplace and sort of fast track to what enterprises are really looking for and is understanding what the service availability is and how to analyze this up in terms of its component parts. So it is an exciting thing. I mean, the reason that we are still projecting it is not material is we don't have any history yet with the product and it's going to take us a quarter or 2 to start developing that history. Same thing that happened last year when we acquired Mirror42. We now have some good history on that, but we're excited about it. This is a very strategic component to our approach to that part of the marketplace. Michael P. Scarpelli: What I would add, Rob, is the company was a mix of perpetual and subscription licenses. In fact, when you normalize that to be subscription, they're doing less than $1 million a quarter. And in purchase accounting, we lose a lot of that, and we're not expecting with new deals being signed that's going to be that meaningful for the balance of this year. Frank Slootman : And going forward, we're not going to do any perpetual transactions with Neebula. Everything will be on a subscription basis. Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Sounds good. And then second round, new customers added. I think it was one of your strongest, if not your strongest quarter. So talk a little bit about customer acquisition at this point, types of customers that you're seeing out there and what competition has at this point. Are you seeing anyone get a little more competitive with any of their cloud offerings? Frank Slootman : This is Frank again, Rob. I think we were exceptionally strong, both within our customer base this quarter with our renewals and our upsells, both being at or near record numbers, as well as our new customer acquisition, obviously, with the scale of our sales organization and then the number of ramp reps that we have out there going up quarter-on-quarter. Those numbers are going to get pushed higher. We also had record number of acquisitions in Global 2000 accounts, which is even more meaningful to us because that represents a ton of future upsell potential. So I think we're hitting on all cylinders here. From a competition standpoint, the dynamic really hasn't changed. It's really the -- more of the same of what we have reported on historically in terms of the legacy vendors. I mean a little bit of competition coming up from the bottom. That's truly the end of it. Our win rate is exceedingly high. I mean if we have any losses, it tends to be in the context of postponements or doing nothing for the time being. So that -- the status of that is really good. I think our brand position in the marketplace continues to strengthen quarter-on-quarter here. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Mike, I'm wondering if you can talk about million dollar deals and how many you had in the quarter and just generally characterize what the large deal sort of success rate and the environment looks like for large deals in your business right now. Michael P. Scarpelli: Yes. So last quarter, we closed 5 deals, north of $1 million. We now -- with the upsells that we have in the quarter as well to the customers, we now have 91 customers that are paying us north of $1 million a year, up from 80 the prior quarter. In terms of looking at our pipeline, we have a lot of big deals in the pipeline. But big deals tend to be lumpy. We had a number of big deals that pushed from the quarter into this quarter right now. We expect that, and that will continue to happen. But it's -- the nice thing about our model is we're not dependent on any big deals to make our number, and you can see with our guidance increase how comfortable we are with the opportunity we see in front of us. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. And then I think I asked you about -- sorry, go ahead. Michael P. Scarpelli: What I was going to say is -- what I will say is, we had record number of deals in that $500,000 to $1 million bucket this past quarter. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. And then I think I ask you about this almost every quarter in terms of your sales hiring. And we continue to see just very steady additions on the sales side. Is there any reason to think that it'll be different than that, either you slow down in the second half or you accelerate the sales hiring in the second half? Or how should we think about that looking here into the back half of the year? Michael P. Scarpelli: So we now are at 64% of our hiring target for our sales and marketing organization, and as we've said before, we typically front-end load that. But we're going to continue at -- we're going to add roughly another 170 to 180 in the second half of this year, so slightly below where we're at right now. Frank Slootman : We're actually down on our plan now. Michael P. Scarpelli: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a follow-up on Walter's questions on the big deals. Mike, I think you had 2 of your largest transactions ever in Q1. And I just wanted to be clear, in the second quarter, did you have any elephant-sized transactions or were -- just as you described, they were more antelopes than elephants this quarter? Michael P. Scarpelli: They were good. We had 2 deals in Q1 that were north -- they were $4 million-plus annual deals. This past quarter, the biggest deal we did, I think was $1.8 million in the quarter. So as I said, we had 5 deals. But what I will say is the upsells, we did a number of -- 3 of those big deals were upsells, but we also had a number of upsells to customers kind of in that $500,000 to $1 million range. And we also sought 2 big deals in APJ, which were north of $1 million, which we're very pleased with the execution in that region. Remember, we opened up a lot of new countries in APJ in 2013, and we're starting to see the impact of that. Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on -- Frank, you mentioned the strong traction in Global 2000 and that you saw that in your average transaction size. Can you just give us a sense of are you starting to see the concept of a enterprise license agreement get put in place so they can expand beyond IT and HR to different divisions or is this still kind of a case-by-case combat, if you will, that you're still seeing in the sales motion? Frank Slootman : Actually, this quarter, with the pricing evolution that we talked about previously and that we introduced, that now is an ELA framework that we have trained our sales organization on, whereas before, that's really something that we reserved for special situations. Now really, that is just another vector that we've trained our sales organization on that they can execute on because we're getting in more and more conversations where our customers do not want to buy incremental. They want to know what is it going to cost if I just go wall-to-wall and standardize on it. I think there's definitely an inflection happening where customers are looking at us like what does this look like when we go wall-to-wall and we standardize on ServiceNow versus I'm just going to do this set of applications for this set of users and we price at ala carte. So enterprise licensing is going to become a much more dominant part of our business going forward. We've always had activity around that with some of our leading customers that were very, very far along in the implementation. But it's now something that's happening upfront in new conversations with customers because they realize that they're going all out with ServiceNow, that's the way they have to approach the pricing model. And it's much more favorable as well because it's just -- the economics look much more interesting on an ELA basis if you go wall-to-wall than it does incrementally. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : As a follow-up to the nice wins on the HR Service Automation side, I'm wondering, what could cause you guys to implement a separate sales model? Frank Slootman : Say again? What would cause us to implement a separate sales model for these different use cases? Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Correct. Frank Slootman : Yes. That's something that we have to be pretty damn careful with because it starts to bifurcate the model that we have and how we go to market. I mean our go to market, if you may recall from prior calls, we always seek to land an IT organization, occupy that space, then use the advocacy of the IT organization to start invading adjacent service domains. That's what we do, right? So we typically don't like to sort of go off to HR on our own without first having established an IT or certainly not without having IT as a strong advocate in rolling that out. That is a very key part of our sales strategy that we don't want to do that. I mean, we sometimes violated that and it comes back to bite us because all of a sudden, IT is now at odds with us because we've established ourselves in another service organization and we're not in IT yet. So we try to avoid that. Now, is it possible that down the road we get so much critical mass in some of these other service domains that it pays us to do that? We will definitely consider that. At this point in time, that's not on the horizon. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : That's helpful. And then as a follow-up to the question on sales and marketing adds, obviously you're adding at a very high rate. I'm wondering if you could comment on growth in sales productivity this quarter. Frank Slootman : The sales productivity was actually -- was good. It was up both sequentially as well as year-on-year. Ramp reps are increasing in productivity, which really illustrates that our growth model is working. We are successfully converting sales people to yield as they move through their ramp periods. So that continues to work and gives us the confidence to continue to add resource to the sales organization as we go forward. This has been very consistent for us historically, and it continues to be as we get bigger and bigger here. Operator : Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Frank, new record, there were 6 minutes for prepared remarks. The question I had was like -- a lot of mine have been answered, but the -- at the synergy -- at your conference -- not synergy, but at your conference, at Knowledge, you talked about IT operations and an opportunity there. And there's obviously a lot of talk about the platform and going beyond IT. How are you feeling about it? And what are the latest developments around IT ops? And what do you see in there with the initial steps? Frank Slootman : Yes, Raimo, I'll try to set a new record next quarter. But on IT, here's a key point to remember. This is our macro observation around what's going on. IT service management and IT operations management have really stopped being separate markets, separate spaces, separate tools, separate people and skill sets. Their workflows are now cutting across operations and service management. Now we have observed that for some time because we're in the middle of that. We're integrating with operations management tools all over the place through Orchestration. We're not just managing the work. We're actually doing the work as well. We think it's exceedingly important for us that we don't view ourselves as a service management platform exclusively. I think that ITOM is something that's separate in a different marketplace. Those boundaries are disappearing, which is why you see us move aggressively in these areas. There's a ton of opportunity because the people that are on the operations management side are going to have to figure out how to bridge into the service management side, and a lot of those vendors are the same legacy people that we already compete with. So the nice part is we're pleased with the Neebula acquisition because there's always 3 things that we look for when we move into a new marketplace like the operations management side. Number one is we're looking for exceptional talent, which we believe we acquired with Neebula. We're looking for really different -- for technology that solves really difficult problems. And thirdly, we're looking for a completely different way of approaching the problem. We don't want to go in with same old, same old just in order to have it, right? We're trying to invert the market, the same thing that we've done with service management. And it's a very exciting time. The tools on the operation management side are very stale, are very old, are very expensive. Customers are very, very ready to look at new approaches. And especially, they understand as well as we do that, that service and operations management are not going to be separate markets going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Frank, you talked a little bit about you're seeing solid growth from the HR app that you guys put out there last year. I was just kind of curious if you had any sort of updated thinking on what you guys might do around developing additional first party apps versus creating more of a sort of an AppExchange or an App Store for the platform. I know you guys have been sort of thinking about that. I just wanted to know if you had any sort of updated thoughts on that. Frank Slootman : Yes, that's actually correct. That's heavily in planning mode within ServiceNow. Last year, you saw us introduce the Share infrastructure, which is really a content exchange, especially for customers and partners. But in order for us attract the professional software developer people that develop software for a living and have to sell it, well, we're going to have to have a monetization infrastructure as well. And we're in the midst of -- in planning on having that. We have preliminary designs on making that available by Knowledge15 next year. So we are first definitely going after the professional software developer with the ServiceNow platform, and we need to have a monetization infrastructure in order for that to be a successful strategy for us. That's great question because it's very much on our minds these days. Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just to make sure I heard that correctly, by '15, you guys think you'll have something in place to start monetizing some of those apps that can be built on top of that? Frank Slootman : Yes. Knowledge15 is -- we like to sort of draw the line in the sand around our big Knowledge conferences because it's sort of like a forcing function for us to make sure that we deliver. And we did that with Knowledge14 with the Share infrastructure. A lot of our products sees the light of day around the Knowledge conference. Operator : Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Frank, can you talk about ServiceNow business edition? Have you found it to help you expand your TAM? And how different are these markets, the mid-markets and enterprise? Also, would you need to develop a separate sales force to target them? Frank Slootman : Yes, good question. We've been adding customers on Business Edition reasonably well. I mean, we now have quite a few customers where we have a nice population that we can learn from, from what the product is doing and what it needs. But in terms of the go-to-market model, yes, we're really trying to change things up quite a lot to make it completely unattended to get away from a lead generation model, move toward a demand generation model. It's going to -- when we're all said and done, it's going to look a lot more like our low end -- our very low-end competition that people are really aiming for the SMB marketplace. I mean you're talking about transactions that are $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 a year in size. It's different in every regard and not just in the products but the contractual model, the support model, the feature set, the product and so on. So we're getting some really good experience. We're adding customers, but it is -- we are still on a journey here. It's going to be very, very different from our go-to-market motion that you see us exhibit on the enterprise side. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : And Mike, a follow-up on your billings guidance. Now will specific billings guidance become a regular feature now? And also, you're calling for about $15 million increase in deferreds next quarter. That's in line with what you did over the last couple of years. We have -- in the first 2 quarters, we've seen an uptick contained in deferreds this year. So if you can just help us understand puts and takes for billings for next quarter, that would be helpful. Michael P. Scarpelli: We will be giving billings guidance, and the deferred revenues is falling out from the billings and the revenue guidance, and we feel comfortable with that. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Greg McDowell - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to ask about the Eureka release. I think you guys pushed that out earlier this summer. Any trends you're seeing from the customer base so far in terms of update -- or uptake in some of the new features of that recent release? Frank Slootman : Yes. This is Frank. The uptake on Eureka has been amazing by historical standards. I think the data so far shows that it has moved 3.5x as many people by this time than our previous release, which was doubling. And that's a function of how compelling the content of the Eureka release has been. So that is going really, really well. Greg McDowell - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : And one quick follow-up. I was just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the expansion of the Board of Directors and your views on why that took place. Frank Slootman : Yes. So the Board of Directors is evolving as a function of the company going public, the VCs being fully distributed in the company and just moving into the mode of being in a completely institutionally held public enterprise. So I mean we've added -- last year, we added Charlie Giancarlo to our board. Just now, we added both Sue Bostrom and Anita Sands. These are all people that have really large company background and experience. We plan on becoming a large enterprise. So we need to have people around the table that have been there and seen it done and can really help guide us. So our VCs are still around the table, but they will not be forever. So this is just an ongoing evolution. There's nothing abrupt about it. This is something that will take place over a number of years. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I'd like to swing back to the HR service management module and ask, what kind of improved service efficiency are some customers seeing by putting this in? And then separately, what is driving that improvement or whatever level of improvement they're seeing? Is it automation and self-help? Is it changing the processes? I'm sure it's a number of things, but if you could help us understand what kind of a benefit people might see and in what form, that would just be great. Frank Slootman : Yes. This is Frank. Terrific question. What happens in most HR organizations today is that there's just a volume of inquiry coming over to transom [ph] by email and by phone and HR organization staff to try and deal with it and respond to that in some reasonable manner. The problem there is we don't know how well we're doing. We don't really know what we're working on, what the sources is of the volume of work that's driving through the organization. So while we're executing on the service model, we're really not managing it. And what happens when you put a service model in place, I mean, a number of things start to happen. You get immediate data on what it is that your organization is working on. You can break it down by geography and categories and also how well your organization is actually doing in terms of responding to the workload that is coming at the organization day in and day out and so on. Once that data becomes apparent, first of all, we can manage our workforce a lot better. We can hold people accountable for their performance. But we can also start to get proactive around why is all this work coming over to transom [ph], right, are we having a problem with our group plan health insurance, are we having a problem with our 401(k) provider, what is it that's driving our work into the HR organization. Most people proactively start knocking off the problems that are driving the volume. This is, by the way, exactly what IT organizations do as well. Then you often see the staffing levels drop dramatically because the workloads go down. That is the essence of service management. Now as I said earlier, in human resources, the workloads tend to be very information-centric. People are looking for answers to specific questions, what's the policy on this and so on. And the faster that people can get to that information without actually invoking the time of people, right, the less resources are needed to deal with those workloads. And I've seen organizations that have cut their HR staffs in half, 50% in -- and once they started, they get full visibility to the work that was flowing through the organization week in and week out. So going from not having a service model and not managing service model to actually having one and then fully incrementally improving it, the benefits are dramatic. And that's why a lot of organizations say this is a total no-brainer compared to being on voicemail and email and just chasing our tail all day long. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. So when you stand at a high level, you look over the organization, there was a ton of white space in the IT department. As you've just described, there was a ton of white space in the HR department, where else are -- when you look over the entire organization, are there pockets of white space to be addressed also? Frank Slootman : Well, I mean, if you take it through its logical conclusion, everybody who works in the enterprise as both a requester of services and a provider of services, right, as a provider of services, that's really what your job is. If you're working in an organization, you are a provider of services in some form or fashion. So that means that if you are a provider of services, a service model is probably in order, depending on what your deal with. You work in procurement, you deal with suppliers, you work in facilities, you work in sales, you work in marketing, wherever it is, if you're a service provider, a service model is typically not far away. You're also a requester of services. A requester of services, we all are because we need help from HR, we need help from IT, we need help from facilities. So we need to have the ability to invoke the help and the systems of these organizations, and that's also, of course, where we have the service models. So in the end, every single employee in the enterprise is both a requester and a provider of services, and they're going to be -- and depending on what hat they're wearing on that particular moment, they're going to be on a ServiceNow system absorption, whether it's facilities or HR or IT or procurement, vendor management or whatever it is. You're on one part of the service model as a requester or as a provider on the other side. So that's how we're -- it's not just white space. I mean it sort of engulfs the entire world of work, if you will, and that goes on in an institution or in an enterprise. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens. Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division : One housekeeping item. Did you guys give the Global 2000 customer adds in the prepared remarks? Maybe I missed that. Michael P. Scarpelli: Yes, 455 Global 2000s. We added net 29. Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then, Frank, one for you. How does the competitive environment change for you in some of these large deals where you're going after the very broad enterprise service management deployment? Frank Slootman : Well, I think, first of all, it's not that different in terms of who the usual suspects are. They're the same people that we've always contended with because they're the incumbents trying to hang on to the legacy that I've built over a long period of time. But as I said earlier, we're at an inflection now where ServiceNow is not just viewed as being usable or useful in a few areas, but it's viewed as something that needs to be standardized upon because it makes sense to do so. And also, my comments about the whole ELA structure on pricing also address that. So competitively, people are viewing us much more as an enterprise platform now than they ever had before when they really were targeting a few specific applications that they wanted to automate with ServiceNow. So that -- from a competitive dynamics standpoint, I think we're much more threatening than we've ever been. And if you tie to that our forays into ITOM, now we're invading from our service management platform those markets as well, and that obviously also deals with the same set of competitors that we have on the service management side. So this game is far from over. We're just still in early innings, and we're going to be dealing with that same cast of characters for a long time. Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And on the platform side, are you starting to have situations where you're running into Force.com? Frank Slootman : Yes, we do and that's been going on for years as well. I referenced in the prepared remarks the CIO survey that is done by Morgan Stanley. And they survey 150 CIOs every 6 months or so, I believe, and there's always 2 platforms that get mentioned in that survey. It's Salesforce and it's ServiceNow. And I believe in the last survey, our numbers in terms of projected use by CIOs were right out there with Salesforce. So I think we are having tons of traction in this area, and we're obviously high profile that CIOs know about is in our -- and planning to be on our platform this year or next. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Susquehanna Financial Corporation. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I wanted to ask about the pricing change and now that it's been out for a couple of quarters, just kind of curious what the net effect has been. Is it helping with velocity of new use cases? Is it helping to monetize usage from the installed base? What really has been the desired effects? And how is that tracking relative to expectations? Frank Slootman : Yes, the -- this is Frank. The net effect of that set of introductions has been a reduction in friction. Making changes in pricing is never easy, and we keep doing it and when we encounter friction or have opportunities to make business go easier and faster. And we strongly feel, based on the experience that we now have under our belt, that the latest change is really, really helping for various reasons to reduce the friction. So we're pleased with it. Our sales people are pleased with it. It's a lot of progress from where we were. I referenced the ELA framework is really being a second vector to really approach enterprise-wide transaction. That is helping a lot because the incremental model introduced a lot of friction for enterprise-wide deals. So it's really good steps forward, and we're pleased with where we are on pricing. It's not an easy thing, but we're converging on a really good place with it. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Great. And I wanted to go back on the question on the new customer activity. Very good number. I'm just wondering if you can give a little bit more color as to the incremental strength. Is it more international? Is it moving down market? Is it more channel leverage? Because it does seem like it was a bit of an inflection from looking over the last year or 2. So just trying to get a better sense of what the drivers were if anything sticks out. Michael P. Scarpelli: I would say it was broad-based across the world. And what I would say, too, is that it's really still very much a direct sales model. We don't rely on a channel that heavily for sales. We do rely heavily on partners for implementation services. I did point out that APJ, we're very pleased with our results there with some very big deals, but it's really across the board. And you'd expect our new logo count to go up given the number of ramp reps we're moving into right now. So there was no surprise there on our front. And by the way, new customers exclude business addition of customers. Frank Slootman : Yes, good point. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Tim Klasell - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Just a follow-up there on Business Edition. How many customers do you have on there? I think you gave us some customer counts a quarter or so ago. Wondering how that has ramped. Michael P. Scarpelli: On Business Edition today, paying customers, we have 14 accounts in the last few quarters that we signed up. And we do have some other customers as well, too, but as Frank said, we're still learning a lot from those customers on what we need to do before we really do a big push with this. Frank Slootman : Yes, we're not in the mode of massively scaling and ramping business position. We're very much in a mode of discovery and improvement, where we're not yet applying a full thrust of effort behind it because we feel we're not ready to do that. When we have -- we have now a couple of dozen customers that are some -- Mike said 14 or so that are paying customers where we have a whole bunch of them that are in test mode. It is the right pool for us to do the work that we have to do to figure that out. I expect that we're going to spend a few more quarters really in this kind of a mode of adding customers incrementally. Like this before, we really are going to sort of open the floodgates. We're not at that point. We don't think we can productively apply the resources to it. So we're sort of holding our powder dry until we feel we're at that point. Tim Klasell - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay, great. And then on the Neebula acquisition, getting good feedback from your partners on it. But how much customer overlap do you have? How many customers -- joint customers do the 2 companies have? Frank Slootman : I think Neebula has about 30 customers in production. I think there's probably, I think, maybe about a dozen or so might be ServiceNow customers. They were a very active partner of ServiceNow. They came to our conferences. We had an integration with Neebula already. They were able to populate our CMDB and work with our Discovery tools. But that's just the history. We think that every single customer that Neebula can appeal to ServiceNow can appeal to as well. I mean, there's 100% intersection there from an opportunity standpoint. I mean we will present and lead with Neebula every single place that we go in with ServiceNow. You can count on that. Michael P. Scarpelli: The one thing I need to add [ph] is we are completely reimplementing that on top of our platform, which is going to take us some time to do as well, and you'll see a really big push on that. Frank Slootman : Yes. That's actually a question that was asked earlier that I didn't address. We said in prior calls, we're very fanatical around platform, and when we do acquisitions, we look at the architecture and the implementation to make sure that we can do it and that we can do it in a reasonable time. Mirror42, the acquisition we had last year, was fully implemented over a 9-year -- 9-year, excuse me, 9-month period. We are already far along, and the planning stage is doing exactly the same thing with Neebula. It's going to move into the ServiceNow cloud. It's going to use our data model. It's going to -- from a UI standpoint, you will not be able to tell that it's not a ServiceNow application, and it will get refreshed and managed right alongside everything else inside ServiceNow. So that's a very strong commitment we have to platform strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Maxim Group. Bradley H. Sills - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : It sounds like great uptake in this quarter's early traction on the HR application. Can you comment a little bit on what you're seeing in the other 2 facilities in field service? Frank Slootman : Yes, and these are application areas that are -- have exactly the same kinds of characteristics in terms of service model. And typically, they're similar to HR in the sense that historically, they haven't had anything. They just have email interactions with people that needed help or services from those areas and particularly in procurement. They really ought to view themselves as a service organization because there's a very high intensity of interaction with people that are doing the requisitioning of services. So that's why the payoff is quite compelling to go to a structured, defined service model. But HR, because it is so employee facing in terms of what it does, it's the place where people like to go first. And the HR organizations are typically quite animated and interested in service models because they view themselves more service organizations, I would argue, than a purchase organization does that deals with suppliers all day long. But we will see good uptake in all these areas. I mean the sale that we're really trying to make with CIOs is that, look, you need an enterprise service model to make sure that the organization that you have in your enterprise are behaving as service providers and that you have structured processes that allow you to report on it and see how well you're doing, are you efficient in delivering the services and so on. And that's a new thing for large enterprises and institutions in the public sector. Bradley H. Sills - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : Great, Frank. And then just one on the CreateNow portal. Are you seeing any trends with use cases or even applications that you could see evolving into another category of line of business application that you package up and sell yourself? Frank Slootman : We haven't really seen anything of that sort where there was activity going on that we picked up and started repurposing for sale and not excluding that, that might happen at some point. One thing I will mention about CreateNow, there was quite a bit of inflection during the quarter in terms of 8 percentage of the total non-ITSM revenue because it jumped during the quarter from 6% to 14% of our revenues -- of our bookings, excuse me, of our bookings. And just remember, 18 months ago, we weren't even charging for this yet. And so this is leaps and bounds. And we were even surprised to see the numbers sort of jump as hard as it did. And it just -- we think it's an indication of just general interest in the platform-building custom applications. It's been out there a while now. Sales people are getting used to it. Customers are getting used to it. So it's becoming much more mainstream in our go-to-market motion. So that was kind of an interesting metric to have seen emerge as well. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I'm just curious on the IT operations market, if you look at that $18 billion or whatever the number is, how much of that today -- post Neebula, how much do you think you can address of that? And then if you look out maybe over the next 3 to 5 years, where do you think that goes? And is it likely to be sort of continued acquisition or more internal development? Frank Slootman : Well, it's -- the $19 billion is a highly fragmented aggregation of subsegments and it includes mainframe. So it's sort of a nice wrapper, but there's no doubt that most vendors, including us, were not addressing the full scope of that today or will be in the future. But obviously, there is -- there are many, many billions of dollars of spend going on in that area. We get questions all the time from our customers what are we planning on doing in this area because they're very, very interested in having this kind of software be on our platform. There are many, many more segments that we are evaluating opportunities both to build, to expand or to acquire. Neebula was really a nice shot in the arm, a really good, solid asset that really helps service availability management, which we think is a centerpiece for IT operations management. But there are many others that are existing categories that are being reinvented and where opportunity is lurking. So stay tuned. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, great. And then just one quick on the government. I mean, was there any activity in this quarter? And kind of if you look into Q3, it's an important quarter. What are kind of your expectations as part of your billings guidance around the federal vertical? Michael P. Scarpelli: Well, federal vertical was not unusually strong this quarter. I do expect next quarter will be strong, and we don't give specific billings guidance around different segments of our business. But I do expect Q3, as you'd expect, will be a good federal quarter for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Most of my questions have been asked already, but I'm just wondering if you could give us more color on the Orchestration add-on sales as well as Discovery and obviously how the ServiceWatch can fit in with the Discovery tools? Frank Slootman : Yes, so those -- this is Frank, Phil. These products have been doing really well. They've been growing as a percentage of our business almost every quarter, and it's becoming the -- by the way, I mean we did a new customer transaction, the largest transaction we did this quarter, which included -- and that customer is now our largest Discovery and Orchestration customers literally like in an initial transaction. Usually, we sell Discovery and Orchestration downstream from the initial transaction. Shows you it's going to become more front and center to what we're doing. So how does it fit with Neebula? I mean, Orchestration -- excuse me, Discovery, really, it finds the hard and soft assets in the infrastructure and then populates a repository. And that scan is typically repeated on a weekly basis to keep it up-to-date. What it doesn't do is map those hard and soft assets to the services that it supports. That's what Neebula will do. So Neebula is highly complementary to the sale of Discovery and the CMDB. This is something that has to be -- if you don't have Neebula, that is something that has to be done manually, which is darn near impossible because it will be out of date by the time you do it. The Neebula is completely dynamic and automated, which is what makes it such a compelling add-on to our portfolio of capabilities. Very, very necessary. And we believe that every customer that is serious about managing service availability are going to need to have Neebula or something like it. Michael P. Scarpelli: And I would add that Discovery and Orchestration were about 7.4% of our net new ACV in the quarter, up from the prior quarter and up from the prior quarter before that with Orchestration growing the fastest of those 2. Operator : We have no further questions. I would now turn the call back over to Mr. Michael Scarpelli for closing remarks. Please proceed. Michael P. Scarpelli: Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Revenues grew 61% year on year to $179 million and billings grew 58% year on year to $201 million. The quarter was marked strong demand from our existing customer base, with renewals at 98% and upsells at 35% of annual contract values signed in the quarter as well as significant new account contributions. During the quarter, we booked a record 11 deals with annual contract values above $1 million. The company now counts 107 customers with an annual contract value in excess of $1 million. Our installed base is now at 2,514 accounts, with 473 Global 2000 customers. Some of the 18 net adds from the Global 2000 in the quarter that we at liberty disclose include Royal Philips in the Netherlands and Crescent Point Energy in Canada.  The investments in our federal sales and consulting teams are starting to pay off, with 41 deals in the federal market representing 6% of net new ACV during the quarter. We had our best federal quarter yet, with several large contract awards from organizations such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a Department of Defense joint combatant command has adopted ServiceNow [unintelligible] international theater of operations. In addition, working with Accenture federal services, another federal agency has adopted ServiceNow to provide a catalog of non-IT services to their global workforce. Many of these contracts extend beyond the IT organization. Our solutions across the enterprise continue to see strong momentum. We signed 24 deals for HR service automation and 13 deals for facility service automation during the quarter. One global logistics group launched its first HR shared service center in the Netherlands and part of a pilot project to align HR across the organization.  With a focus on the common service experience, the HR team is leveraging ServiceNow to provide higher quality services at a lower cost. They have seen significant improvement in service quality and transparency. The group views this concept as portable and has plans to expand to two additional markets in the coming year.  We continue to see heavy use of our CreateNow platform that allows customers to build their own custom applications. In February 2013, 64% of our customers that were on a ServiceNow instance for more than six months used our platform to create an average of 3.7 custom applications per customer. Looking at that same cohort of customers today, 83% have now created an average of 6.4 custom applications per customer. We\u2019re also seeing more customers come onto the ServiceNow platform with CreateNow as their entry point. For example, one large Canadian bank with more than 45,000 employees started with ServiceNow outside of IT and with CreateNow will replace hundreds of Lotus Notes applications. ServiceNow will be the designated platform for rapid application development and deployment across the enterprise and we were chosen after a three-day bake off with two other platform providers.  Another customer, a leading Australian bank, provides payment solutions for more than 140,000 merchants and onboards more than 20,000 new merchants every year. They went live during the quarter with a customer application built on ServiceNow to help improve overall merchant management. They simplified and automated the process for bringing on new merchants, including credit checks, pricing, training, and shipping payment devices. Through ServiceNow, the bank can now approve an application during the first call with a merchant, significantly reducing the time for the overall process and dramatically improving the close rate of new opportunities. In other news, Morgan Stanley\u2019s most recent CIO survey ranked ServiceNow as a top platform vendor, with one of the highest adoption growth rates. The survey showed that CIOs plan to more than triple their usage of ServiceNow as a platform by the end of next year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, Frank. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP results and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. Total revenues for the third quarter were $179 million, growing 61% year over year and 7% sequentially. Subscription revenues for the quarter were $150 million, representing 62% year over year growth and 13% sequential growth.  Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells, and renewals, were 33.1, 23.7, and 24.3 months respectively, compared to an average of 33.5, 24.1, and 26.2 months on a trailing four quarters basis, respectively. Professional services and other revenues were $28 million for the quarter, growing 55% year over year and decreasing 17% sequentially. It is important to note that prior quarter professional services and other revenues included $8 million from our Knowledge event while all expenses related to the event ran through sales and marketing. Excluding Knowledge, professional services and other revenues grew 10% sequentially. Our average total revenues per customer were approximately $275,000, an increase of 21% from the prior year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Our average cumulative annualized contract value for Global 2000 customers was $658,000 at the end of the quarter, up 72% from the prior year and up 13% from the prior quarter. Total revenues based on geography were $120 million in North America, $47 million in EMEA, and $12 million in Asia Pacific and other, representing 67%, 26%, and 7% of total revenues respectively, compared to 69%, 25%, and 6% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2013. Our total billings were $201 million in the quarter, including an FX headwind of $4 million, compared to $127 million in the prior year and $187 million in the prior quarter, representing 58% year over year growth and 7% sequential growth.  Our weighted average subscription billings term for the third quarter was [unintelligible] months, compared to 12.3 months for the third quarter of 2013. The year over year decrease in weighted average subscriptions billing terms was due to an increase in co-terming of upsell deals, coupled with the removal of incentives to bill for periods greater than one year in our 2014 sales compensation plan. Our subscription gross profit was $119 million, representing a gross margin of 79%, compared to 78% in the prior year and prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 41 employees to subscription cost of sales [unintelligible] 146 employees. Our professional services and other gross profit was $4 million, representing a gross margin of 13% compared to 7% in the prior year and 34% in the prior quarter. Excluding Knowledge, our prior quarter non-GAAP professional services and other gross margin was 13%. During the quarter, we added 15 employees to professional services and other cost of sales, ending the quarter with 385 employees.  Our total gross profit was $123 million, representing a gross margin of 69%, compared to 66% in the prior year and 69% in the prior quarter. Excluding the $8 million in revenue from our Knowledge event, prior quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 68%.  Our operating margin in the third quarter was 6%, compared to 3% in the prior year and negative 3% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 123 employees to sales and marketing, ending the quarter with 929 employees; 72 employees to research and development, ending the quarter with 542 employees; and 32 employees to general and administrative, ending the quarter with 309 employees. Net income for the third quarter was $6 million or $0.04 per basic and $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2 million, or $0.02 per basic and $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year, and a net loss of $10 million or negative $0.07 per basic and diluted share in the prior quarter. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 146 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 163 million. During the third quarter, we generated $25 million in cash flow from operations, which includes the negative impact of a one-time capital gains tax payment of $11 million, resulting from the Neebula acquisition.  We used approximately $18 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $7 million in free cash flow. This compares to positive $4 million of free cash flow in the prior year and positive $26 million in the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with $884 million in cash, short term and long term investments, a decrease of $73 million from the prior quarter due to the use of approximately $100 million in the quarter to acquire Neebula. Our current deferred revenue balance was $338 million at the end of the third quarter, up 61% over $211 million reported at the end of the third quarter in 2013. We ended the quarter with 2,611 employees, an increase of 957 employees for the same period in the prior year and an increase of 283 employees from the prior quarter, the most employees we have added on a quarterly basis in the history of the company.  Let\u2019s turn to guidance for the fourth quarter. Please note that our margin guidance is on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangibles and reflects the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For the fourth quarter 2014, we expect total revenues between $192 and $194 million, representing year over year growth between 53% and 55%. Our total fourth quarter revenue estimate consists of subscription revenues between $162 million and $163 million and professional services and other revenues between $30 million and $31 million. We expect billings between $245 million and $250 million, representing year over year growth between 47% and 50%. We expect subscription gross margins of approximately 78%, professional services and other gross margin of approximately 15%, and overall gross margin of approximately 68%. We expect an operating margin of approximately 2%. Additionally, we expect to increase total headcount approximately 245 in the fourth quarter, including approximately 77 in sales and marketing. For the full year 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $677 million to $679 million, representing year over year growth between 59% and 60%. Additionally, we expect roughly breakeven operating margin. For further details on the performance of the quarter, including a company overview and market data, please refer to our quarterly IR presentation at investors.servicenow.com. Before turning to Q&A, we\u2019d like to mention that we\u2019ll be holding our third annual financial analyst day on Monday, April 20, 2015, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. This event will be held in conjunction with our annual Knowledge users\u2019 conference which will take place April 19 through April 24, also taking place at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Please mark your calendars accordingly. Registration details will be available in early 2015. We hope to see many of you there. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley : Frank, I wanted to go back to some of the comments you made around traction with CreateNow. And I think in one of the customer examples you gave, you noted that it was Lotus Notes replacement. Just curious, as you\u2019re seeing continuing success with that product, more holistically, what are some of the use cases that you\u2019re getting in with? And specifically, is a Lotus Notes replacement typical? Or are there other types of systems that you\u2019re replacing in some of these cases? Frank Slootman : Lotus Notes is definitely typical. It\u2019s a platform that\u2019s now aging quite a bit, and typically it has proliferated across to the enterprise to the point where there are sometimes thousands of [unintelligible], and they need a place to go. So we\u2019re often in situations where ServiceNow is sort of designated as the sanctioned platform for the redeployment of those kinds of services.  But we see very similar things around Microsoft SharePoint. There\u2019s a ton of one-off web development, any number of tools, sometimes personal databases, spreadsheets, email, things that have never been automated before.  So it\u2019s a very large group of application in terms of numbers, even though the individual applications can be quite small and simple in size and so on. But there\u2019s typically an awful lot of them and they\u2019ve been orphaned over time. There\u2019s no transparency, there\u2019s security and compliance issues around them, and the IT organization is looking for a service platform that they can sanction for the organization to land those services on.  So Lotus Notes is definitely a chunk of it, but there\u2019s a lot more going on than just Lotus Notes. Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley : And then just a quick one for Mike. You mentioned the strong dollar impact in the guidance, but do you have a sense for what that impact might have been in Q3? Michael Scarpelli : On the revenue side, because most of the movement moved in September, actually, it was about a million dollars on the revenue line. It was pretty much offset on cost savings below the line, so net-net neutral, but it definitely had a million impact on revenue.  You\u2019ll see it has a much bigger impact going into Q4 and how we gave our guidance in 2015, if the dollar stays where it is. It took about close to $4 million out of our revenue in Q4, and it\u2019s going to take about $20 million to $22 million out in 2015. As I said, though, we do have a pretty good hedge with our costs, though. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup : You talked about the 24 deals that were the HR onboarding and 13 deals for facilities management. Can you talk about what sort of pricing and size of transaction you\u2019re seeing there? Obviously these are mostly in the installed base, but what sort of dollar uplift are you seeing in those cases? Frank Slootman : The pricing is actually on a per fulfiller or per process user basis, very similar to what we\u2019re doing on the IT side. On the HR side, the types of systems they are are not so much onboarding, although we do that as well, but typically are a combination of case management, request management and knowledge management. It\u2019s that group of three apps that makes up our HR service automation. That\u2019s usually the go-to for HR organizations to get started with ServiceNow. But from a pricing standpoint, on the per-process user basis, it\u2019s analogous to what\u2019s going on on the IT side. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup : And then Mike, just a question on seasonality. I know you\u2019re not providing full guidance for next year, but we\u2019ve typically seen, as software companies get bigger, they start to see Q1 seasonality with a decline quarter to quarter from Q4 to Q1. And I know that both in 2013 and 2014, you actually saw the opposite with your billings increasing quarter over quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about Q1 of 2014. Have you started to get to the point where you\u2019re big enough that seasonality will impact you, or should we look at the last couple of years as an indicator of what we should see this year? Michael Scarpelli : Yeah, we\u2019re really not going to give any guidance for 2015 until our January call, but I would expect, as you do get bigger and more mature, you will start to see the typical seasonality you see in other companies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird: A question around business management. At the analyst day, you talked about this being a new market you hope to enter in the future. At the time, there was a few new products pending. Can we get an update on where your entry into the business management market stands? Frank Slootman : Business management is a designation, if you will, for a group of applications. One of them is performance analytics, which is a product that we derived from an acquisition that we did last summer. And that product actually saw quite an acceleration and an uptick during the quarter. We\u2019re quite happy with the progress that we\u2019re making. Another area that is getting a lot of attention right now is GRC, governance, risk, and compliance. Essentially, our customers are really running incident management processes around governance, risk, and compliance, when they have exceptions and they have to be worked through and worked out of the system.  So we\u2019re actually happy with what\u2019s going on there. The same thing is true with project portfolio management. The uptick in our customer base, I think, is now about 28% penetration, and that is a very competitive standalone market and we\u2019re making really good headway in that area as well.  Our customers are really starting to see the benefits of running project management, resource management, and demand management functions on a platform, because they benefit from the shared data model with all our other applications and services. So that\u2019s going well. We expect to do well in the future, in years to come, in that area. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne - Evercore: I just had a question actually about the sort of average size of your global [unintelligible], 72% year over year. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that growth? Is it sort of just general expansion of the base or of ITSM platform? I guess are you seeing any commonalities in how those bigger accounts are growing? I\u2019m sure that the platform plays a large role in that, but if you could offer any color on that, that would be great. Frank Slootman : So one of the things that we\u2019re observing is that the growth in terms of average revenue per customer is growing much more rapidly in the Global 2000 than in the customer base overall. I think in the overall number, it\u2019s around 20% year on year growth average revenue per customer, whereas in the Global 2000, it\u2019s around 72%.  One of the reasons is that obviously those big accounts represent complete markets onto themselves. There is just an incredible opportunity. And from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s a very productive sales motion for our sales people, so they gravitate towards that opportunity.  And the final think I\u2019ll say about it is, those large customers have a much higher inclination to view ServiceNow as an enterprise service platform versus what you often see in smaller accounts, where you\u2019re just going after a very narrow definition of the [unintelligible] problem set.  So that\u2019s why you see that traction, the average revenue, and the overall opportunity. You\u2019re seeing more and more separation happening in that opportunity from the general customer base. Kirk Materne - Evercore : And Mike, I think you mentioned that you said you\u2019re going to be hiring 77 quota-carrying sales reps in the fourth quarter as part of the new employees. Is there any concentration where you\u2019re going to be hiring in terms of geographies or in specific, say, overlay positions in terms of specific products? Is there any color you can offer on that? Michael Scarpelli : Just to be clear, that\u2019s 77 people in total into the sales and marketing organization, that\u2019s not quota-carrying reps. And those are being pretty much spread throughout the world. And as we talked at our analyst day on a percentage basis, Asia Pacific is one of the areas, just because they have a lower base, which is getting a higher percentage. But the bulk of those are still going into the North American market, which is still 67% of our business and growing very rapidly. I\u2019d like to just add on a little bit to what Frank said. You were asking about how the Global 2000, how we see that growing and getting to the 658. A lot of that is also, we talked about we did 11 new deals. Many of those were Global 2000.  We\u2019re really seeing a lot of these larger customers getting more comfortable, taking bigger bites of the apple day one, as well with our change in our sales organization that we have, our client account directors focused on our largest accounts, so there\u2019s upsells. We\u2019re starting to see that really pay off this year with all the upsells. And it also supports, too, the assertion that we think our Global 2000 over time, we should be extracting $2 million on average out of those people. It\u2019s going to take time. It may take another four to six years to get there, but there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t get there. We have 107 customers now, I think Frank said, that are paying us north of $1 million a year. Just with those 107, they\u2019re paying us over $1.8 million a year, on average, right now, and those guys will continue to grow too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Michael Turits - Raymond James : Mike, in terms of the planned headcount adds, can you pull out how much is from Neebula? It seems that [unintelligible] relative to those, to the targets with Neebula and prior to Neebula, it seems like you\u2019re higher than the original plan. So can you talk about why that ramped up? And also, does that maybe have something to do why the margin guidance is somewhat below what we were expecting from, at least the Street was, for Q4? Michael Scarpelli : As we said all along, we\u2019re going to be opportunistic. If we see good people, we\u2019re going to hire good people. If we don\u2019t find the right people, we\u2019ll slow our hiring down. Based upon the opportunity we see, we\u2019ve kind of put the pedal down on the gas pedal for hiring. Yes, Neebula is accounting for that, as we said last quarter. I think 30 of the adds in the second half of the year are a result of the Neebula acquisition.  And that will obviously have a negative impact on our margins for this quarter, but that\u2019s not the only thing. A lot of that was the timing of those adds in Q3, but furthermore, there was some expenses that got pushed from Q3 into Q4. Hence, we had the higher than expected operating margin in Q3. Michael Turits - Raymond James : And you beat this quarter on margin, so it looks like it\u2019s about even for the second half, just a little push forward. And secondly, last quarter you did I think it was 32% of net new HCV was from non-ITSM. How did that square up this quarter? Michael Scarpelli : It was about the same this quarter. As we said before, that\u2019s not really a metric that we manage the business on, because quite a big piece of our business still comes from our legacy contracts with upsells, so you can\u2019t distinguish between what is ITSA and what is non-ITSA. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Justin Furby - William Blair & Company: Frank, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about productivity across reps this quarter. And also curious around, if you look at the quarter in ratability in terms of bookings and demand environment, did you see any changes? Did it look any different from any other quarter? My guess is it didn\u2019t, based on the numbers you put up. But just would be curious to hear comments on productivity and then just ratability this quarter. Frank Slootman : We were actually quite happy with the productivity numbers, the way they developed. We were up both sequentially and year on year on productivity, which gives us very strong confidence, not only to [unintelligible]. We\u2019re quite capable of converting the people that we hire to yield, and we\u2019re actually stepping up the numbers in Q4. So that\u2019s just a testament to the confidence that we have in the model, that it\u2019s working, that it\u2019s yielding. In terms of the overall demand environment, we\u2019re such a secular play that we typically don\u2019t feel the headwinds of sort of the natural environment in various geographies. We were just strong across the board, and we\u2019re able to very productively engage wherever we go. So we\u2019re quite happy and bullish on the demand environment out there for our particular play. Justin Furby - William Blair & Company : You had another iteration of pricing changes in June, and I know you love this question, but what did you see this quarter, and do you feel like the latest iteration is sort of where you\u2019ll land? Or what\u2019s been the customer feedback in Q3 around the new pricing? Frank Slootman : We\u2019re actually incrementally more confident that the pricing is hitting its stride. The friction\u2019s been going down. The conversations are more productive. We certainly have had our challenges, but as we said before, we keep changing if we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve got it right. But we\u2019re in a better place now than we\u2019ve been, certainly since we started here.  Does it mean that we\u2019re done done? No, we\u2019re never done. I mean, pricing is a dynamic thing, and we will continue to tweak certainly some other areas of the pricing model around some of the non-IT applications where we have some focus right now, where we have opportunity to make incremental changes. But on the whole, we\u2019re in a pretty good place right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets : Appreciate the additional color on CreateNow. It seems like it\u2019s really taken off. I believe last quarter you indicated that it represented about 14% of ACV. I\u2019m wondering, was it pretty similar this quarter, or did you see an uptick there? Frank Slootman : No, it was between 8% and 9% this quarter. These numbers bounce around. One single transaction can move the number up or down. That\u2019s still high in a historical context. I think last quarter it just bumped up due to some transaction activity. But on the whole, that\u2019s moving well. So we\u2019re happy the way that\u2019s trending. Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets : And then maybe regarding Share, I wanted to circle back on really the pace around the efforts to monetize that. Maybe how we should think about the timing of third party developers writing apps on Share? Frank Slootman : I think I said during the last conference call that we\u2019ve committed ourselves to building an app store or monetization facility on top of Share by the Knowledge \u201915 conference, which as Mike said is in April of \u201915. So that\u2019s sort of the timeframe. We\u2019re getting a lot of interest in the marketplace from our global partners and people, because we have so much market now, we have good routes to market, that we are becoming a really attractive place for people that not just write software for a living, but have people that need to build software and then sell it. Putting the monetization place is really not so much important for us as it is for them, to be able to make money and have a route to market, if you will, so they can run a business on our platform. So that\u2019s going to become a much bigger thing for us in 2015, obviously, when we start rolling that out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. Alex Zukin - Stephens: Frank, if you could talk a little bit about HR case management, how you guys view that market size as you continue to have success and traction there. Frank Slootman : The HR marketplace, I think I\u2019ve said prior there\u2019s about 1 million to 1.2 million, depending on who you believe, HR professionals just in the United States, and I think the worldwide model is probably some multiple of that. So we think that opportunity alone, just for case management - forget there\u2019s a whole raft of other type of HR service applications, but just for case management, we see a billion dollar opportunity for HR.  But that doesn\u2019t include, as I said, onboarding and offboarding, compensation planning. There\u2019s so many offshoots of request response workflow processes that we can go pursue with ServiceNow. And when I say case management, it is just the incident request and knowledge side that we\u2019re talking about here, that represents that billion dollar opportunity. That is just based on how many HR people we think are out there, based on data that\u2019s publicly available. Alex Zukin - Stephens : And then Mike, just one housekeeping question. I\u2019m not sure I heard it on the call, but just the percent of billings that were for greater than one year? Michael Scarpelli : We went away from giving that. Instead, what we\u2019re doing, which is more meaningful, is giving people the weighted average subscription billings for the quarter. And the reason being is you could have a billing that could be for three years or 1.2 years, and it skews things, and the weighted average gives it better. So it was 11.9 months was the weighted average subscription billing on a year over year comp of 12.3. Alex Zukin - Stephens : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill - UBS : Frank, just on the federal business, you obviously saw one of the best quarters ever. Can you give us a sense of how you\u2019re approaching this, not just from a U.S. perspective, but on a global basis, and the plans to trickle through the [unintelligible]? Frank Slootman : Sorry, the plans regarding the federal business on a global business? Brent Thill with UBS : Right, government in general. Taking the success you had so far and extending that. Frank Slootman : The federal business is very separate, because it has a separate sales team, it has a separate cloud. It is a very unique business, and we think the potential of the federal business in the United States is probably as much as 10% of our contract value that we signed. And it was about 6% of our contract value this quarter, so we actually made a dent in it, because it grew dramatically on a year on year basis.  And most of our business is actually coming from civilian. The whole DOD side hasn\u2019t even kicked in yet. So we\u2019re actually quite bullish. It\u2019s taken us some time to mature in that space. We\u2019ve got some really good partners there. We referenced Accenture, that\u2019s very heavily involved with us in that marketplace  When you get outside of the United States, it\u2019s really part of our national market sales motion. So we attack all these foreign markets. One dynamic that is going on in a lot of foreign markets is that there\u2019s a lot of focus on the sovereignty of the cloud in countries like Germany and France, Benelux. We see it in Canada.  I think in the U.S. we\u2019ve done quite a bit of damage with the Patriot Act and so on, and that static is something that all the cloud vendors will have to deal with and soon, because that will become a headwind to the business. We have some really good strategies in place to deal with that, because of the way our cloud operates. We\u2019re going to be much quicker on the trigger to be able to accommodate those unique requirements than the people that run multitenant environments.  So I actually view it as an opportunity more so than a challenge, especially coming from the national government organizations and in foreign markets, healthcare, financial, everything that people view as very critical in their international markets. That\u2019s where that pressure comes from. Brent Thill - UBS :  And Mike, you\u2019ve given some great color on some of the larger million dollar plus transactions in the past, and I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any common patterns or interesting stories you could share just on some of the larger deals that you saw come in this quarter. Michael Scarpelli : There was nothing unusual with those large deals this quarter. Frank Slootman : No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything noteworthy that comes to mind that\u2019s out of the ordinary, from what we\u2019ve been doing. Obviously, we did a lot of large deals this quarter. Last quarter, we were a little bit lighter. This is not a business that\u2019s super linear. These things bunch up, and some quarters we\u2019re lighter on big deals and others, we\u2019re over weighted. That doesn\u2019t mean much, because our business can sustain itself really, really well, with or without a large volume of big transactions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Pacific Crest. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : With regard to the large deals, were there any elephant-sized deals in the quarter, or were they in the typical $1 million to $2 million range? Michael Scarpelli : We had a few that were around $3 million in ACV, two actually came in right around $3 million in ACV. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : And then on the DSO front, it was a really strong quarter from a collections standpoint. Did that speak more to the linearity of the quarter, or Mike, really a focus on collections for your team? Michael Scarpelli : No, it\u2019s really a focus on collections. It was typical linearity that we saw in the quarter. And I was actually very pleased with my team. But it also speaks to the customers that we\u2019re selling to, I think is more important. We sell to large enterprises. We don\u2019t have collection issues with large enterprise. Where we have collection issues is when we deal with thinly capitalized resellers, and most of our business is direct with large enterprise. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : And then lastly, on the Neebula front, was there any contribution to deferred revenue as a result of that acquisition? Michael Scarpelli :  It was not meaningful. Frank Slootman : There was some, though. Michael Scarpelli : Yeah, it was very, very small. And it does not have a big impact on our revenues. It\u2019s pretty much the expenses as we had said, when we gave guidance around Neebula last quarter. It\u2019s really 2015 that it\u2019s going to start to kick in in the revenues for us. Frank Slootman : A lot of interest in our product though, Rob. A lot of excitement. Our sales people really like it. It\u2019s another entry point into the enterprise, so we\u2019re very happy to have that asset. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo : Frank, as you start to expand the use case for your platform inside of an organization, how do you think your sales organization will trend around product specialization? Do you think you\u2019re going to get to the point where you\u2019re going to want to have folks who are maybe going to have specific disciplines, in HR or really kind of some of the domain areas where you\u2019re going to want to go deeper as part of upselling into a company? Frank Slootman : Just a general answer to that question is yes. We are going to apply more vertical or domain expertise. And obviously, I mentioned federal. [unintelligible] sales team, and that\u2019s completely on its own. So that\u2019s the most advanced example of that.  In the case of HR, we need resource teams that have the ability to really look at that opportunity, to make sure that we\u2019re speaking the right language, that we\u2019re attending the correct events, that our whole go-to-market motion is what the customer expects, as opposed to viewing us as an IT-centric organization.  That\u2019s true in a bunch of other places. One place where we\u2019ve done very well in that regard is in big pharma. We have very large presence in big pharma, and we really have a pharma cloud now. And our pharma customers really, really appreciate the fact that we speak the language, that we know what a qualified instance is, that we can provide that. It dramatically reduces friction when we sell into that vertical. So it\u2019s going to be a gradual process, rather than a step function where all of a sudden the whole model is completely different. We will be applying more and more resources that are vertically oriented, if you will. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo : And Mike, I think you sort of addressed this a little bit on fiscal \u201915, at least on Q1, but maybe if I could broaden the question out around billing seasonality, is it fair to assume that over the next, maybe I can make it a two-year comment, that we should start to see a greater percentage of your deals get billed in the fourth quarter, just given what you see with large accounts and the upsells, and folks doing co-terms on billings and just generally the trend towards some of the larger transactions? Michael Scarpelli : Yes, you will definitely see Q4 being our largest billing quarter on a go forward basis. Frank Slootman : It has been. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo : Well, I know it has been, but I think if we look at it, off the top of my head, I think it\u2019s trended to be a third, if you will, plus or minus a few points, of your overall billings. I mean, is a number closer to a four handle maybe the reality in a couple of years in terms of how that plays out on a quarterly basis? Michael Scarpelli : You know, to be honest, I really haven\u2019t modeled that that far yet, from a billings perspective. The only reason we give billings as guidance is because that\u2019s something you guys really look at. We actually don\u2019t manage the business on billings, quite frankly. So stay tuned. In January, I\u2019ll look into that and give better guidance around that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Greg McDowell - JMP Securities : I wanted to ask about analytics. I know you\u2019re partially in this market already, with performance analytics and Mirror42, but in light of the announcements we saw last week from some other SaaS companies, I wanted to ask whether you think your platform lends itself to attacking the analytics market in a bigger way, and perhaps will we see some bigger analytics announcements out of you guys? Frank Slootman : We do view analytics as really, really important to the overall business. We have a little bit of a different point of view on it than a lot of vendors historically have had, because we think that the analytics market is very cumbersome, it\u2019s very heavy, it\u2019s very expensive, it\u2019s very staff intense. So we think there\u2019s actually opportunity for reinvention here.  When we structure and define and automate processes, the analytics actually have to be built into that. In other words, processes have to have defined dashboards, defined reports, defined performance indicators, so you don\u2019t get into this mode of producing these warehouses that can produce millions of views, and people really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for. So this is an area where we\u2019re looking for a much more structured and prescriptive action, rather than here\u2019s a million things you can do with this particular [unintelligible] and slice and dice and pivot the data. Now, with that, we\u2019re going to be focused on providing analytics on top of our operating data and our asset data as opposed to a generic analytics cloud, the way Salesforce is pursuing it, as well as any number of other vendors. So this is not about analytics in general, this is just analytics specific to ServiceNow applications and services that were standing up. Do we think we\u2019re done with what we have today? Absolutely not. You will be able to expect from us\u2026 You know, when that will happen, I don\u2019t know. And I certainly don\u2019t have any guidance on that, but there\u2019s more to come from us in this area. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Tim Klasell - Northland Securities : Most of my questions have been asked already, but just wanted to hit on the competitive landscape, particularly as you move into facilities management. And maybe you can touch a little bit on the HR side as well. Are you beginning to bump into different players? And then maybe just a quick comment on what you\u2019re seeing out of the traditional HPs and BMCs of the world. Frank Slootman : Taking your last question first, I don\u2019t think the dynamic with the legacy vendors has really changed. If anything, it is something that\u2019s weakening and abating more and more as our presence in the market is increasing.  And typically, these vendors are really not contestants and contenders in new opportunities. They typically are incumbents that are trying to protect a position. But in new opportunities, much less likely that we would see people like that. And that is a change from the last couple of years. It\u2019s really become a [unintelligible], and really contesting new opportunities.  In terms of these other markets, on the HR side, there are some vendors that are specific case management vendors that are incredibly surprised to see ServiceNow show up in those places, because we have very different routes to market, and they have historically not seen us in that space.  So we\u2019re really thinking of service management as an enterprise discipline rather than something that is specific to HR or facilities and so on. So we\u2019re a threat to people that just have a specialization in one of those areas, because we have a much broader horizontal approach to that opportunity. There\u2019s different partners there as well, that we are now building relationships with. So it\u2019s really a left field thing for the status quo, to see us show up in those places. Tim Klasell - Northland Securities : How about on the procurement side? I think you\u2019ve spoken about that in the past. How did you see traction on the procurement side this quarter? Frank Slootman : You know, I don\u2019t have any data on specifically on procurement. It is an area that we talk about a fair amount internally, within ServiceNow. We use our own systems for procurement, because we think it\u2019s an ideal area for our platform, because it is very much subject to process definition, structuring, and automation. And it\u2019s also one of those areas where there\u2019s just a ton of email and messaging traffic, all things that we can dramatically improve on. So we think that in future periods, that will become more active. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna: I wanted to expand on the competitive question, more from kind of a horizontal platform competitive landscape. And obviously you\u2019ve got Salesforce and Salesforce One, and they seem to be going a little bit more down the mobile path. But now you\u2019ve got Oracle, and I know it\u2019s new, but they just had a new announcement and product release on the platform side. So I guess from that platform perspective, how are you guys competing, and where may you be addressing different use cases than what they\u2019re doing? Frank Slootman : You know, product for product, there\u2019s always things that can compare favorably or not so favorably. We certainly see Salesforce in a few places when it comes to custom applications. Oracle, I can\u2019t say that we actively see in our marketplace. May well change in future, but we just haven\u2019t.  But let me just make one super important point, and we\u2019ve emphasized this over the years. What makes ServiceNow such a different play is that our incumbency is established through the enterprise IT organization and the IT function. And that is typically how we advance throughout the enterprise. And that\u2019s typically where those organizations don\u2019t land. They try to come in through the line of business or some functional area like sales or market or HR.  So we have a very, very different way of reaching our end customer than some of the vendors that you\u2019ve mentioned, and a strong advocacy position as a byproduct of our presence in enterprise IT. So there will be a lot of activity in this area. There will be a lot of contention. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a super active marketplace. But as you could see in the Morgan Stanley CIO survey, ServiceNow really ranks near the top of platforms that CIOs know that they\u2019re using, and are planning to use. And that\u2019s not an accident. That is because of our incumbency in the world of IT. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna : The SI channel, you guys are getting to a billion of revenue and trying to scale beyond that, obviously. How important is the SI channel at this stage of your growth, and kind of what investments are you making now? Frank Slootman : It\u2019s super important, both the global SIs as well as the managed service providers. They are big influencers and big drivers of opportunities. We\u2019re seeing a huge amount of activity with KPMG, who has been a force in our business, but also a lot of uptake by Accenture, by EY, by Deloitte. The entire group of Indian outsourcers, people like Tata are getting very active in BPO, business process optimization.  That\u2019s all outside of IT by the way. In other words, these people are not necessarily coming into our business through IT. We think the SIs are more important in the non-IT side of our business, because that\u2019s really what they specialize in and what they like to do.  So we have active programs to engage with all these SIs. We\u2019ve staffed in these areas. We view it as very strategic. It\u2019s really a flywheel to our overall business, especially as we talk about Global 2000 accounts. Can\u2019t get around these guys. They are an influencer and a player and a participant. Luckily, they\u2019ve taken huge notice of our presence as well, and in many cases, our customers are the ones telling them that they have to become proficient on our platform, otherwise they\u2019ll be missing out on the party with future projects. So it\u2019s all working good in both directions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Securities Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities : I just wanted to touch briefly on your [international]. Do you think you guys have built up enough presence in any particular region, outside of EMEA, that could really contribute meaningfully to growth next year? Michael Scarpelli : Well, we\u2019ve been investing very heavily in Asia Pacific, and we think the Japanese market is going to start to kick in 2015, as well as some of the Asian countries in general. We\u2019re not in China. We\u2019re not in India, other than on the R&D side, but definitely in Singapore. Our route to China is through Hong Kong right now. And South Korea is probably the end of \u201915, \u201916, that we\u2019ll really start to do things there. And Australia has always been a very strong market for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse : Just wondering if you could give some more color on the orchestration and discovery of [unintelligible] your installed base? And also, how far is the penetration in those markets? Frank Slootman : Those markets are important, because that really represents our focus and our foray into the IT operations management space. Orchestration is something that we message and position as being part and parcel of service management. In other words, you don\u2019t want to think of service management outside of having a fully integrated, from a workflow standpoint, orchestration strategy. You know, our penetration in that area is not nearly what it eventually will be. We really have a goal for orchestration to be as highly penetrated as the CMDB and things of that sort. But we\u2019re not there yet, and that\u2019s because historically these markets have been very separate.  Operations management and service management have been different tools, different peoples, different disciplines, and they sort of touch each other through workflows. But that\u2019s all changing, which is one of the key reason why we\u2019re in operations management to begin with, because it is changing, and we are driving a big part of the change. On the discovery side, because we\u2019re so big on the CMDB side, that always is an opportunity for us, but people can also use non-ServiceNow discovery tools with our CMDB, so we\u2019re getting more mature, stronger in that area.  Of course, the addition of ServiceWatch, through the Neebula acquisition, is going to help a lot, because the ability to have dynamic service maps, that is a huge thing that the marketplace just hasn\u2019t had. So we think that\u2019s going to strengthen our business in that aspect as well. But we\u2019re just getting revved up on the IT OM, IT operations management side, so we\u2019re growing a completely new leg, if you will, in terms of product portfolio, routes to markets, customer presence, mindshare, all those things. It is a market that is probably several times larger than the market we historically have been in around service management. Operator : There are no further questions in queue.

These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's call. We finished fiscal 2014 with strong metrics across the board. Fourth quarter revenues grew 58% year-on-year to $198 million and billings grew 62% year-on-year to $269 million. We also maintained a rapid growth of our combined backlog and deferred revenue balance, which grew 57% year-on-year to $1.4 billion compared to 59% growth in 2013. The quarter was marked by strong demand from our existing customer base with a 97% renewal rate and a 38% upsell rate, and we also signed the most new customers and new Global 2000 customers in the quarter. We booked 10 new transactions with annualized contract values above $1 million, including four in Europe. The company now has 129 customers, each with an annualized contract value in excess of $1 million compared to 67 at the end of 2013. We closed the quarter with 2,725 customers and now count more than 25% of the Global 2000 as customers. Some of our new Global 2000 logos are : satellite broadcaster, DISH Networks; financials services company, Fiserv; and global insurance provider, Generali Group. Our strong upsell performance in part reflects our service management solutions for human resources and facilities. We sold 40 new HR service management transactions and 38 new facilities service management transactions in the quarter. Nearly 35% of these transactions were with customers new to ServiceNow. One European financial institution recently went live with HR service management for their 25,000 employees. The company transitioned from manual processes to a branded online experience to assist employees in obtaining information on healthcare compensation and learning. They converted their manual HR processes into structured workflows to improve efficiency and reporting. Another customer, Cars.com, created an employee onboarding application that automates the manual process to get new employees up and running as soon as they start. As a result, 90% of all new employees now receive hardware/software and systems access on their first day. In addition, Cars.com extended their use of ServiceNow to help its facilities team to be more effective and efficient in managing their workload, especially while away from their desks. The team has mobile access to ServiceNow, so they can tackle issues, while they are dealing with other incidents. With ServiceNow, the facilities department has more than doubled the efficiency of their limited staff and dramatically improved internal customer satisfaction. During the quarter, we also officially launched ServiceNow Express, a rapid deployment service management offering aimed at companies that want a standard solution with configuration kept to a minimum. Express appeals to enterprises of all sizes, including smaller institutions we previously could not address with our enterprise products. At the end of the quarter we counted 76 customers on Express, a number that is growing rapidly. Customers like specialty investment bank, Ziegler, have cited the ability to get up and running quickly with a solution that can grow with them as a key differentiator. DealerSocket, an automotive software company, said that a disciplined and process around teenage management was an important driver for them. Seventy Seven Energy, a diversified oilfield services company emphasized that Express provided them the simplicity they needed without compromising the necessary functionality. Express is currently available in North America and Canada. We plan to launch in other geographies starting in Q2. We also saw a great traction for our recently acquired ServiceWatch product. Existing customers use ServiceWatch to add dynamic service discovery and mapping to their CMDB deployments, a key capability that increases the value and use of the CMDB. We've already signed more than $5 million in total contract value into two quarters since we acquired ServiceWatch. The annualized contract value for our overall IT operations management business more than doubled in 2014. We saw more customers deploy custom applications to help them manage processes directly connected to their core business. For example, Australia-based RMIT University is tackling its student's admission process with ServiceNow. The goal is not only to improve the student experience, but also to boost the student application conversion and acceptance rates, which in turn drives the university's overall revenue performance. The ServiceNow platform was selected after a technical bake-off against other large software platform players. Finally, during the quarter, we opened previously announced data centers in Asia and South America. These data centers improve our ability to serve the needs of local customers that require the data to reside in a region. We now have eight paired data centers on five continents. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, Frank. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q1 and full year 2015. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results, in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise, with the exception of revenue numbers, which are GAAP. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $198 million, growing 58% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Subscription revenues for the quarter were $167 million, growing 59% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells and renewals were 34.5, 23.0 and 25.4 months, respectively. Professional services and other revenues were $31 million for the quarter, growing 54% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Our total revenues per customer were approximately $287,000, an increase of 21% from the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Our annualized contract value for Global 2000 customer was $713,000 exiting the fourth quarter, up 40% from the prior year and up 10% from the prior quarter. We now have 129 customers paying us more than $1 million in annualized contract value, up 93% from 67% in the same period last year and up 21% from 107% in the previous quarter. Total revenues based on geography were $135 million in North America, $49 million in EMEA and $14 million in Asia-Pacific and other, representing 68%, 25% and 7% of total revenues, respectively. Our total billings were $269 million in the quarter, representing 62% year-over-year growth and 34% sequential growth. Our weighted average subscription billing term was 11.8 months for the quarter compared to 11.8 months in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our subscription gross margin was 80% compared to 78% in the prior year and 79% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 32 employees to subscription cost of sales, ending the quarter with 478 employees. Our professional services and other gross margin was 16% compared to 13% in the prior year and 13% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 31 employees to professional services and other cost of sales, ending the quarter with 416 employees. Our total gross margin was 70% compared to 67% in the prior year and 69% in the prior quarter. Our operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6% compared to 2% in the prior year and 6% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 80 employees to sales and marketing, ending the quarter with 1,011 employees; 43 employees to R&D, ending the quarter with 585 employees; and 27 employees to G&A, ending the quarter with 336 employees. We ended the quarter with 2,826 employees, an increase of 996 from the same period in the prior year and an increase of 213 from the prior quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter was approximately $5 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $3 million or negative $0.02 per basic and diluted share in the prior year, and net income of $6 million or $0.04 per basic and $0.03 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 149 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 164 million. During the fourth quarter, we generated $48 million in cash flow from operations and we used $9 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $39 million in free cash flow. This compares to $20 million of free cash flow in the same period of the prior year and $7 million in the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with $936 million in cash, short-term and long-term investments. During the year, we signed a record total contract value of $1.2 billion, growing 64% year-over-year. This resulted in $422 million of total deferred revenue at the end of the period, up 58% over the balance at the end of the fourth quarter in 2013 and up 20% over the balance at the end of the third quarter of 2014. Combined deferred revenue and backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion, growing 57% year-over-year compared to 59% year-over-year in 2013. On a constant currency basis, combined deferred revenue and backlog grew 62% in 2014. Now, let's turn to guidance for the first quarter and full year 2015. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues between $207 million and $212 million, representing year-over-year growth of 49% and 52%. We expect subscription revenues between $176 million and $180 million, and professional services and other revenues between $31 million and $32 million. We expect billings between $260 million and $265 million, representing year-over-year growth of 44% and 47%. We expect subscription gross margin of approximately 79%, professional services and other gross margin of approximately 12% and overall gross margin of approximately 69%. We expect approximately breakeven operating margin and we expect to incur approximately $4 million in expenses associated with our sales kickoff event held once a year in January. Additionally, we expect free cash flow of approximately $30 million in the quarter. For the full year 2015, we expect revenues to fall within the range of $960 million and $1 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 41% and 47%. We expect subscription revenues between $810 million and $840 million, and professional services and other revenues between $150 million and $160 million. We expect approximately 5% operating margin for the full year and to end the year with approximately 170 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Similar to 2014, we expect to add approximately 1,000 employees, allocated to COGS, sales and marketing, R&D and G&A at similar rates to 2014. We also expect our hiring will be front-end loaded similar to previous years. Before closing, please note, our annual users' conference, Knowledge 15, will be held April 19 through April 24 in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. In conjunction with this event, our Financial Analyst Day will be held on Monday, April 20 at 8 :00 AM local time. This year we are also opening up our partner expo hall to attendees, giving them an opportunity to see and speak with hundreds of ServiceNow partners. In-person attendance will be limited, so if interested in this event, please send an invitation to ir@servicenow.com. For those who cannot join in person, we will hold a webcast for this event accessible on our website. Additionally, due to the timing of this event we will report Q1 2015 earnings on Thursday, April 16, 2015. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs. Greg Dunham : First, just a clarification on metrics and that I heard you correctly. Did you say it would have been 62% constant currency growth on the backlog versus the 67% number? Michael Scarpelli : Correct. Greg Dunham : So a 5 point headwind. Should we assume that the 5 point headwind was consistent with billings as well? Michael Scarpelli : There was a billings headwind as well for the quarter. The billings that impacted us for the quarter were approximately $5.6 million in the quarter. I don't have it for the full year of the billing though. Greg Dunham : And maybe a little bit bigger picture. I mean, you're starting to show a lot more success in HR and facilities. Can you give us a sense of how big the deal sizes expand, when you do sell HR and facilities in the two-thirds of customers that are existing customers? Frank Slootman : One thing that's really important to understand about our go-to-market motion is that, we're selling service management, we're not selling an IT flavor and HR flavor or facilities flavor. So our whole thrust is to get enterprise to really embrace and adopt the service management for the enterprise. And there is multiple flavors of service management typically under consideration that our customers want to implement and deploy. So we're not managing and skewing the business, what the contributions are of these individual elements. If there's anything, we're trying to erase those boundaries and not have our customers view us in terms of those individual solutions, but really take an enterprise view of service management, and adopt it as a platform to implement a service platform for numerous service domains. I mean, we talked a great deal about HR and facilities, and the reason is, those are adjacent service domains. Typically that's a low hanging fruit. But there are literally hundreds and hundreds of other applications, some of them are very fine granularity, other are much broader. So we don't think it is very productive, just sort of try to dissect and split the service management business into all these component parts, because we purposely try not to sell that way, not to manage it that way, and really get enterprises to adopt it on an enterprise basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Lowe : Frank, I wanted to follow-up on a comment that I think you made in the prepared remarks around Express. And in particular, I think you mentioned that the functionality is something that would be appealing to customers of all sizes. And I know in the past that it's been, and even on this call, it was positioned as more of an entry-level product at the lower-end of the market. But I am curious, if you see scenarios where Express could potentially get traction in large organizations as well. Frank Slootman : Yes. That is absolutely a scenario that we think is realistic. We've not seen a ton of evidence of that to date, but we don't want to position Express sort of as a mini-me SMB type product, like sort of the little brother of big ServiceNo. The focus of Express, and that's why it's branded that way. It's really a product that is extremely prescriptive. It is meant to deploy very, very quickly where customers are not engaging in process design workshops and so on. They're using the processes as defined out of the box. So it's a little bit of a different tangent, if you will on how to do things and which we think that may eventually start to appeal to larger enterprises as well. So we didn't think it was wise from a positioning standpoint to say, hey, this is the small business type product, even though it does open up that market for us, which has great incremental opportunity, but we will not preclude the fact that that larger enterprises may -- that this may have appeal for them as well. Jennifer Lowe : And then just one last one from me. Just curious if you can comment a little bit on what you're seeing competitively, either on the ITSM space, or more specifically as you get more into other areas of ITOM and enter some of these platform used cases. Have the companies that you've come up against competitively shifted at all? Frank Slootman : It hasn't really shifted, if anything, the profile of the company has grown so much. And specifically, we are moving away from an ITSM centric positioning to an Enterprise Service Management approach, which really helps in terms of competing with people that have a very, very narrow perspective on the opportunity, right. And we see the market moving in that direction. We now have customers coming out that really are starting the conversations with us in that way rather than starting with that very narrow defined ITIL toolset. That sort of was the way the business was for years and years. We still see the same old folks that we've always seen on the custom application side. We see contention and contest there with pure play platform companies for example, like Salesforce, Oracle and so on and we'll see more of that as time goes on. On the ITOM side, it's the other set of players that everybody is familiar with that we're competing with over there. But I don't think there has been a fundamental shift. The theme here is that the company's profile has grown so much that our hand has grown stronger relative to just serving all these opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : I guess, Frank, on the sale side, it looks like you're going to add, based on Mike's commentary on sales count or headcounts adds in the pro rata versus last year, it looks like you're going to add about the same number of sales people this year as you did last year. Can you talk about where you're adding those people? And how you're maturing as a sales organization? And I am just curious, are you at the point yet where you're starting to really push on productivity as a big driver with quotas going up and so forth versus just adding headcount and driving it that way? Frank Slootman : So Walter, in terms of productivity, if any thing, we're going to hire as fast as we can, while keeping productivity roughly in the same place. That's what we've been doing. We will continue to do that. I mean, if we see really strong uptick in productivity, it just means to us that we are not hiring fast enough and we are leaving opportunity out there for somebody else, so our posture in that regard hasn't changed. In terms of the maturity of our sales motion, we have a much more extensive coverage model now, because we have a global accounts model that is split both between people that are focused on new logos and new accounts and then we have the client director model and that's an entire team of people that's focused on existing customers. And then below that we have an entire commercial organization that is also split between new logos and existing accounts. So we have become much more fine and granular in terms of how we're addressing the different types of account whether they're new or existing, because selling to existing accounts is a very different motion, very different model than hunting new logos where it's all about getting beach head and an initial buy-in and then sort of growing it from there. So it has matured and become much more sophisticated over the last couple of years. Walter Pritchard : And then, Mike, just a quick one on the numbers. It looks like CapEx was like half of what it was in the year ago Q4. And I know, you're doing a lot of data center build out and replatforming and so forth. Can you talk about what drove that and how we should think about CapEx in 2015? Michael Scarpelli : So the CapEx in Q4 being as lowest it was, was really timing on things. And in 2013 Q4 there was more facilities related buildup. We were roughly for the full year CapEx in the low 9s as a percent of revenue. In 2015 as we announced the new facility, we're going to be moving into, we expect that CapEx that's going to be roughly at that low 9-point-something-percent of revenue for the full year. Now remember, three years ago was when we did our original big data center migration. We have the refresh that's happening in all of our data centers with that old equipment that's coming up. Depreciation will be replacing over the next year as well too. That's the other reason, why our CapEx is staying relatively high in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Mike, just on the customer add that stuck out as one of the highest growth rates you have in two years. I know that in '13, you focused on the existing base, but it seems like this year was a repivot to adding net new. I'm just curious, if you could maybe walk through that the strategy, as you go this year? And it sounds like from Walter's question that Frank addressed, that this is that segmentation you are pushing pretty hard in both existing and new, but not favoring one or the other. Can you just walk through that build out? Michael Scarpelli : What I would say is, one of the reasons why you'd expect our new logo count to go up with the number of reps we've added and the number of ramps reps we've had, you have to have more logos for those people who aren't bringing in new accounts. Our focus is really on quality of customer, as I've said many times. And what we mean by quality of customers, the large customers, because those are the ones that buy more from us. So the one metric that we tend to focus on and I am particularly focused on are the Global 2000. We now have 522 of the Global 2000 as customers. 31 of those were actual adds, the other movement was because of Global 2000 acquiring customers of ours, but that's the metric that I really look at. And why that is, is that Global 2000 account for 50% of our business. We don't actually pay anyone on new logos per se. And in 2015, our goal is really going to be just going after quality customers, not necessarily a fixed number. Frank Slootman : Just one quick follow-up. I think we have said over the years, it's a three-legged stool. It is high renewals, high upsells and new logos. And if you're executing each of these three areas, that's when you get to high growth and the combustion and the whole business is humming and working well. So there is a no repivoting going on here that would just shift that emphasis. We've always pushed on all of three, very high renewals, very high upsells, and we must plan to flack in terms of new logos, at the same time all these things need to happen, we're going to do very well, and that's our strategy. Michael Scarpelli : And I just wanted to remind you with these large customers it's long sales cycle. Brent Thill : Frank, at the Analyst Day there were a number of real high profile SIs that had talked about the partnership they are building with you. Maybe if you could comment about what you're seeing from some of the SIs? If you could comment just a little bit about some of the capacity that's coming on? Are you comfortable with where you are getting that support in the field? Frank Slootman : Yes. We've really made an enormous amount of progress, certainly in the last couple of years, but especially in 2014, the large SIs and it's a whole spectrum, sort of at the top end. Obviously, KPMG has been with us for a very long time. They are really very early to invest, but people like Accenture are sort of at the top heap. They're really beginning to double and triple down and really realizing and understanding how important this is. Again, it's an enterprise play. Forget the ITSM positioning, that's just one component of it. So the very high end brand profile. GSIs are coming in very hard. But then there is a whole group of GSIs and outsourcers that are super-active in our business, people like Tata, TCS coming in, Infosys, HCL has been with us for a very long-time super-successful, Cognizant, CSC. What's really great about this that's for our customers, there's a tremendous ecosystem, right. There is a very, very extensive set of choices geographically as well, where you can engage people that have really, really good experience on our platform and it's a key factor in our growth and our business going forward. It's a big focus as well for our sales organization 2015 to really work on a very fine engagement model in all geographies where we operate with that community of players. We think it's very important for our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard : I had question on your '15 operating plan. If you look at your sales productivity metrics and new adds on customer front, you're doing great both in adding new logos and obviously upselling and cross-selling into the base. So my question then is when you look through '15, when you look at your target operating margin, is that a fixed point that you're going to try and sell for during the year? Or do you accelerate hiring maybe in the second half? It looks like you're beating your targets on the topline? Michael Scarpelli : We are never going to stick with a firm operating margin target for the year. That is kind of the way we look at it right now. We think that is something that's achievable. But if we see we're able to ramp reps faster, the opportunity, or we find good people, we will accelerate the hiring. If we see any type of slowdown, in terms of customer demand, we'll take the paddle off the accelerator and not hire as many and then you will drop more to the bottomline. But we're really focused on growth and continuing to show some margin expansion, but not too quickly. Jason Maynard : And maybe a follow-up for you, Frank. I mean, if you look at where you're making the progress on the operating margin front, I know we're just talking about '15 here, but given your expansion of the product portfolio and your penetrating new parts of the enterprise, is there a range that you think is too aggressive or not aggressive enough in terms of expanding headcount even as you think about going into next year? Frank Slootman : Well, there is, right. I mean, we look at headcount expansion. It's all led by the tip of the spear, which is our sales organization and all the other functions need to be balanced out in support of that effort, right. And we're essentially looking at sales expansion in terms of the productivity, how that's developing for us, so that's really how we're led. But we're not led by trying to produce an operating margin of a certain number. Obviously, when we give guidance, there are constraints on how that all works out, but fundamentally this is a productivity equation, and which we've said over and over, if periodicity holds, it means the model works. I mean we are converting people to yield, and those ramp reps are coming in at those productivity rates, and we will continue to hire. If productivity rates are starting to really go up, that's a signal for us to go hire. If it goes down, it will be a signal for us to moderate the hiring. There is actually metrics as well that we look at that would help us determine whether we go faster or slower. But that's fundamentally how we're looking at our business. So we're very affirmed from a profitability standpoint and we're much more economically oriented in the sense that it's about contract value, it's about cash, right. And if we keep that in a very healthy balance, we have a very, very healthy, very high growth business and we're gradually moving the margins up as we go along here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. Rob Owens : Just in terms of the sales and sales compensation, is it still equal as we look at new customer versus upsell in terms of quota retirement and how your sales people are compensated? Michael Scarpelli : Yes, a dollar is a dollar to us, whether it's a new customer or an upsell. Where you get the variability is a rep who is one of our client account directors who has some of our installed customers, their quota will be different than what a account executive who is going after hunting. So generally a new customer, those people are going to have lower quotas, so they're going to make commission dollars per dollar of ACV, our contract value, versus the guys who have the existing accounts. Rob Owens : And there is a little bit of spike in G&A sequentially and it's been kind of volatile throughout the year. What was that? And is 18.5% kind of the run rate going forward or should we see that resettle a little bit here? Michael Scarpelli : Well, as you know we do have some litigation and there is cost associated with that litigation that are now starting to heat up with vMC and HP, so you will get some variability based upon the work that's done by outside lawyers. Rob Owens : So that being said, we should continue to see this higher rate of G&A? Michael Scarpelli : Correct. Rob Owens : And then lastly on DSL front, its improved year-over-year for the last three quarters, is that a function of linearity or just a better job of collections on your part? Michael Scarpelli : It's a better focus on collections for us, I will say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : I'm the newbie I'm going to ask you the dumb question, so thanks for indulging me. Question for you, Frank. When you look at your opportunity relative to say Salesforce or Workday, how are you looking at those companies relative to your go-to-market? When you look Salesforce sales, marketing, customer support, broadly speaking front office, there is certain amount of leverage and understanding of the sales process there. Whereas Workday, setting to two completely different problem domains, finance, HR. Are you more like a Workday in terms of your go-to-market or more like a Salesforce? What are the things that you looked at the SaaS landscape and have figured that are worthy of replicating and certain things that are so unique to ServiceNow? Frank Slootman : So we're definitely farther afield from Workday than we are from Salesforce in the sense that I think Workday and us have a fairly good balanced relationship in terms of what they do, what we do. There is not a lot of overlap. Sometimes there are some processes that probably either leader company could tackle, and so it depends on various factors, whether a customer go this or that way, but on the whole that's fairly well delineated. Salesforce lives much closer to where we are, because of Service Cloud, because of Force. There are many more opportunities for us to sort of get into an overlapping motion. I mean fundamentally when you strip away all the jargon and the alphabet soup, we are all workflow orchestration platforms and we can tackle a very wide range of applications, whether they are external like CRM or whether they are internal like surface management. And it's no surprise, and by the way, Salesforce is very well aware of this. There's no secret here. The market is very large, so as a result we're not bumping into each other every minute of the day, but as the companies get larger and we all are getting larger here, I think the potential for contest is going up. Certainly, our customers understand this as well, that's when you peel away the veneer and the jargon and the rhetoric, the core capabilities all move on the similar set of issues. Kash Rangan : And I guess, as a consequence, the nature of sales people you're hiring going forward is going to be different than the kind of people that you hired a year back or two years back, I would suppose. Frank Slootman : Well, I think that's years ago, we picked up people that were very familiar with the ITSM problems, the ITIL processes and so on. We have long moved past that and we've been hiring people with ERP backgrounds from Oracle and SAP. People those who really have big time enterprise selling backgrounds that we've actually done very well; people coming enterprise and infrastructure companies as well that have done outstanding in our world. There really wasn't sort of one place to go to for us to really run our hiring model through, and we sort of have to figure it out and piece it together on our own. So we haven't sort of gone to one set of companies where we sort of consistently get our people in. That's worked well for us. So it is an ERP grade type of sale. There are long sale cycles. They are very strategic. They are very campaign-oriented. They involve many, many different audiences and stakeholders all the way to the top of the house and executives, CIOs, COOs, CFOs and sometimes in many cases even CEOs as well, and that's not untypical for the other companies I mentioned either. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank. Nandan Amladi : I just have one question. Clearly, 31 net customer adds in the Global 2000, that was pretty impressive. I just wanted to ask, how has the profile of an initial signing changed? Is it more skewed towards seats or broader set of modules? And how do you sort of skew compensation for your sales people? Frank Slootman : So that actually has changed a lot and you can see that from the success not just in the Global 2000, but how large the transaction sizes are. And that is a function of how broadly we're selling now, right, instead of trying to do a legacy service desk system replacement. That's not how we're selling anymore. We're going in the much higher level. And we're driving service management as an enterprise discipline. And right from the get-go we're trying to get to higher ups in the organizations, CIOs to see the opportunity for all the other service domains that they have to address, and the fact they have tons of legacy sitting around in terms of largest notes and SharePoint and a plethora of web tools. They're looking for a platform that they can sanction for their organizations to stand up this new class of workflow services, right. So our sales motion and our messaging has evolved dramatically and that is what's driving larger transactions for us, and that is how we are training our sales organization, that is how they are going to market. We used to really sell at manager and director level, and then go to VP signature and now we're really almost invariably working at top of the house with our transactions, because of the size and the strategic nature of it. Michael Scarpelli : And I will add to that too Nandan that most of our sales still are on a per user basis, it's licenses that are seat licenses that are driving that other than our ITOM space, which is more on a per device basis, how we're licensing those. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Abhey Lamba : Are you seeing kind of more learning points within HR and facilities or is IT still a lead-in sale for you? And when you see some pure HR facilities to have some opportunities, competitively do you see any different players over there? Frank Slootman : It used to be that way. It was always landing in IT, that that has absolutely changed. I think I said in the prepared remark that I referred of those HR and facilities transactions were with customers, where we had no IT engagement. I mentioned the example of the Australian university, they are not IT users of ours either. So it is becoming more and more common. It's a growing part of our business, where IT is not the entry point. So this is really great for our sales organization, because we don't easily strike out. We can also come in through the ITOM side of the house these days, and so it's great. We will take any opportunity to build the beach head and we will go from there. So that's a growing trend. And I definitely expect that to continue. Abhey Lamba : And competitively, any different kind of players there? Frank Slootman : Yes. I mean we do see in HRM facilities you see pure plays, people that only do that sort of that thing. And obviously we're a platform player and we're a surface management company, so as a result it's a very different tangent and it's driven as an enterprise initiative for me. What companies are fighting is the extreme fragmentation and sprawl of tools, it's really not in the interest for HR to have their own little thing in facilities and field management and pretty soon they have hundreds and hundreds things laying around. But it is the nightmare of an IT organization to get this fragmentation and sprawl. So we already ended out to that mentality and approach to standing up with this class of services. Michael Scarpelli : I will add to that, Abhey, though is even though we maybe selling into HR or some of the other lines of business, we are generally still doing this with the IT organization and CIO, we are not doing this behind their back. Frank Slootman : Yes, preferably not. I mean we're always looking for the advocacy of the IT organization, the sanction, if you will, that we absolutely prefer not to be at odds with the IT organizations. There is a bunch of competitors out there that do come in through organizations other than IT, and then are at odds with IT. Last thing we want to be with our customers, be at odds with the IT organization that would be very counterproductive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg : Frank, I believe last quarter, CreateNow was at I think between 8% and 9% of quarterly ACV. Can you give us a sense for where that was in Q4? And maybe how that should trend in 2015? Frank Slootman : I don't know off the top of my head. Michael Scarpelli : So the one thing to -- I don't know what that number is right now. And the reason we don't know that is we're not really managing our business that way as we've said before. Such a big portion of our business is coming in from our repeat customers with upsell. And yes, we know exactly what the skew number is for the current quarter, but remember 38% of our business we said was upsell and a big chunk of those upsell is tend to be custom app development on our platform. So we really want to stop talking about the platform and ITSM and it's really going to be a service management concept that we're going to be talking about going forward in ITOM. Frank Slootman : It's super important for everybody on the call, to try and internalize that. There is no platform business here that is separate from any other ServiceNow business. ServiceNow is really one thing that does many things, but its one thing. And we're trying, we're selling it that way, we' are not managing it that way, and it doesn't serve our capital markets customers to think of our business that way. Matt Hedberg : And obviously, very strong cash flow for the quarter and the year, Q1 guide looks great. I think it's over 130% growth. Mike, when we think about the 5% operating margin targets for the year, is there way that we should we think about the spread between, let's say, a cash flow margin and operating margin going forward or is there a way to think about that? Michael Scarpelli : Yes, there is a way to think about that. And you will see next year our free cash flow margin will be greater than our operating margin. It's going to be sometime before they catch up. And eventually over time they should converge or get closer to converging. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : I guess, Frank, you guys had a really nice year in terms of growth in the Global 2000 customers. I guess is there anyway to think about, I guess what's helping them expand. Is it new use cases? Is it more seats on existing used cases? I know that to you guys it probably doesn't really matter as long as they are growing. But, I guess, what do you see sort of fueling that growth within sort of customers that obviously know you very well to start with. Frank Slootman : It's all those things, right. Sometimes we're biting off new divisions in the Global 2000. We don't always take down everything there is to take down. I mean, most of the time we don't. And I guess, there's just internal organizational delineations that sort of prevent that from happening. And it takes time to sort out really become fully standardized, fully implemented and be the world implementer. So there is certainly a growth factor there in terms of consolidation. And then the other growth factor is the one you mentioned, which is going after other used cases. And the use cases are endless, right. I mean any structured workflow orchestration problem, we can go on pursue with our platform. And you never are going to run out of opportunities with that kind of scope. Kirk Materne : Frank, can you talk just a little bit about the App Showcase? And could you believe you can a little leverage from some those apps this year? Is that something that takes 12, 24 months to sort of build momentum behind? I guess, how should we think about that sort opportunity for you guys from sort of other apps, other ITs building on top of your platform? Frank Slootman : That's actually has become a growing focus for the company. Certainly at our Bay Conference this year in April in Vegas, you will see us introducing the notion of a ServiceNow store. We're very active now in really sort of building ServiceNow as a place for professional software developers. And the difference here is that professional software developers are not just people that build software for a living, they are people that sell software for living. We have tons of people that build software living, but they don't sell it, they just build it for their own purposes. It's really for the crowd of people that build software and sell it. Those are the people that we have to make incremental accommodations for in terms of what it costs to developer on our platform, how attractive we make that. And we need to provide them with the community and monetization model, so that they view the ServiceNow market, if you will, because we now have as Mike said, 500 and some Global 2000 enterprises. Those are all opportunities for them, right. This is the market to sell into with a great platform, very well established routes to market. But we got to make sure that we have everything in place operationally, contractually and economically to make this a good place to be for them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. Alex Zukin : I want to actually expand on the just asked question about the monetization of the app store opportunity. If you kind of compare and contrast the way you're thinking about monetization with respect to an app exchange from a Salesforce.com, what have you learned or what are kind of puts and takes about how you're thinking about that space versus some of these establish players? Frank Slootman : So a couple of things. First of all, we think Salesforce has done a really good job, so we've got school on their learnings and their successes in that regard. And it's a little bit different than what you see on the consumer side with companies like Apple and so on. That said, our focus is going to be more aggressive on recruiting people rather than -- the monetization is not monetization for our sake, it's monetization for their sake, right. In other words, the software developers, they have to be able to run a reliable business on our platform. It is not as critical for us to insert ourselves transactionally, even though we're going to do that. That's not the focus of this effort. Certainly, not being an issue we're going, right. So it's really like how do we make ourselves as compelling a place to be for people that build and sell software for a living. So we're going to be more aggressive than players that are further along more established in this regard, because we're now going to contest in fact other players in this regard. Alex Zukin : And then Mike, on the seven figure deals that you guys signed in the quarter, where there any kind of elephant or whale-sized deals, multi-million ACVs? Michael Scarpelli : No. There were $2 million was kind of highest. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Mike, I jumped on a little late. So can you just reiterate the margin guidance for next year and also the FX impacts in the quarter and in the guide? And then Frank, I was wondering if you could just visit the ITOM, your thoughts on ITOM, event management, some of those things you've talked about in terms of your entrance there and what you maybe doing so far there with Neebula? Michael Scarpelli : So we said, 5% operating margins for the full year breakeven Q1. In terms of the FX impact, what I had said was on the deferred revenue and backlog year-over-year there was a $40 million impact there for the full year on a constant currency basis. And then on the billings for the current quarter, there was an FX headwind of $5.7 million as what the FX headwind was in the current quarter on billings. Michael Turits : Anything on the revenues that you've given guidance on the revenue and then you also mentioned what you thought '15 would be? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. So 2015 just given where the euro and other currencies that moved against the dollar subsequent to December 31, we took another $13 million out of our revenue, which has already been factored into our guide for 2015, which had already had a big impact on our backlog as you saw. Michael Turits : And then Frank on the ITOM? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. So in my prepared remarks I mentioned that we had really good progress during the quarter on ServiceWatch, sort of the first quarter out, we started to really get our act together and we started selling it, so that we exceeded our own expectations in that regard, so that was good. The second thing that was good is, I mean we nearly tripled our ITOM business year-on-year in 2014. And that's really, I don't want to say without trying, sort of Salesforce would take exceptions to that comment, but we didn't have a real strong effort and focus behind it. It was sort of drafted everything else that we're doing. And I'm actually super excited about the opportunity that we have there, because that market is really, really larger than the service management opportunity and we have just some ideal jump of opportunity. Just in last week, I was up in Seattle, where our folks are that are managing our ITOM products. I've seen the ServiceWatch reimplementation on ServiceNow. We're going to show that Knowledge 15. I am super excited about what we're doing in this area. It is such a compelling piece of technology and it is just very, very high leverage, because it's going to help just about everybody there, everybody needs to have the ability to dynamically map and discover services in the way this technology does it, it's very compelling. So I'm excited about ITOM. I think we can drive this business way harder than we have. We have a very strong dedicated group of people that are getting after this business, and because it's not been our traditional focus, because we are a service management company, I just think we have room up here going forward, so all good. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Greg McDowell : Just one quick question for you Mike. I want to go back to that $1.4 billion backlog in deferred revenue number. Since we only get that number once a year, and as I look at the historical relationship between backlog and deferred and full year revenue, it does suggest revenue growth this year could be quite a bit higher than your 2015 guidance. So I guess my question, is there anything different about the backlog and deferred revenue number? And how it may translate into actual revenue number this year or is there just some level of conservatism in there in 2015 guidance, and obviously FX impacts that does? Just wondering if you could give us a little more color on it? Michael Scarpelli : The one important thing you need to remember at the backlog is multiple years of contract value in there. So what I will say is, in 2014 we saw a lot of renewals for customers being three-year renewals, because that's how we are incenting our sales force. So you can't necessarily do a direct correlation between our deferred revenue and backlog growth to our revenue for next year, because there is multiple years of contracts to be build in that number. And what I will say is, as we disclosed or we signed, I think it was about 34.5 months for their average new customer contract last quarter, which was up from the quarter before. So you do get variability in your contract lengths quarter-over-quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Justin Furby : Frank, I was hoping you could discuss new ACV bookings by geography in Q4. And maybe talk a little bit about, if you look outside the U.S., how win rates have been trended across sort of the major APAC and European market? Frank Slootman : I think North America and EMEA, the main European theaters, are all doing really, really well. We're very happy with how diversified our revenue streams are geographically, not just across North America, but in lot of the European markets. And just made a lot of ground there and it's just very, very consistent and very reliable productivity and so on. Now, when you get to markets beyond that, like Latin America and you get to Asia, outside of Australia; Australia is also a market where we've been a long time, where we have strong critical mass and a lot of predictability. The newer markets is where we still are up and down from one quarter to the next, because we're very developmental in nature over there. And we just accept that, because we have to get started sooner or later, and it's just the investment that we're making and it's sort of part of the productivity equation as well. If you just invest in markets that are super-productive and predictable, yes, you can drive your productivity numbers up rapidly. But we know we have to be in these places, and we were sort of biting the bullet and sort of dealing with the pain that we're going to have upfront to really figure out the models and how to do business there. Specifically single-up places like Japan and Brazil, where we have those kind of challenges, but those are markets where we have to be and we're there. Justin Furby : And then, just quickly on the Global 2000, you've got a quarter of it. Do you think the next 500 that you go after, are those easier to win harder? And I guess what's the primary reason preventing the other 75% from moving to you, is there one theme across those or is it all sorts of different reason? Frank Slootman : Well, you can see it both, as easier and harder, harder in a sense that this is a group of people that were not early adopters, right. The other guys obviously were more aggressive, more technology savvy, more focused, more interested in moving quicker. But at the same time, time is not their friend, because the systems they are setting on are aging and old, and getting increasingly higher risk and more expensive and more painful. The other thing I will tell you is, the risk for that sort of the next batch of Global's is going to be way down, because there is just so much experience out there, ecosystem is so big and rich that it's going to be much easier to cross this bridge forward. ServiceNow is a much bigger company than it was at the time, when the sort of the first 100 sort of stepped through the door. So there's a bunch of things going on. I just think we're still early going, because not only have we sort of tackled the first 500 of them, now we're far and far from saturated in our opportunity into Global that we already have. And that's why we have the type of sales organization and allocation of resources the way we have, because we view those Global's almost as markets on to themselves. I mean that's how rich and opportune they are, and how much upside we have to sort of gain more share of wallet, if you will, in those places. Michael Scarpelli : When we going to new geo, the first question we ask is, how many Global 2000 are in that geo, and that is usually the deciding factor as to whether we go into that market or not. And there is still a lot of markets out there that have Global 2000, where we're not there yet, and it just takes time to get them. We'll get there eventually, but we're going to do it at a measured pace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley : At your Analyst Day, you laid out your broader vision and help us understand that, and that included ultimately pushing into business management. Can you give us an update on where that initiative might stand today? Frank Slootman : Well, business management is a whole group of capabilities that are sort of above the layer of the operational workings of service management. So it has things like project portfolio management, our governance risk compliance, all our analytics capabilities. We announced last year at an IT financial management initiative that's something that we're going to showcase at the Knowledge Conference coming up, because financials are sort of the third dimension, the first dimension being asset, the second one being operating data. So there is going to be really -- the business management, I see that as another area like ITOM, where there is an enormous spent opportunity for us to access. I mean we're just getting started and really beginning to understand, and really get footholds in those opportunities. So we're very opportunity rich as a company, which is exciting going forward. We have many places, if you do come to Knowledge, we're going to showcase as much as we can in the time that we have available to do so in a lot of these places, like business management. You're going to see business management, you're going to service management, you're going to see operations management, you're going to see application enrollment, all those things. So it will be a much bigger view of ServiceNow than you have ever seen before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. Derrick Wood : Pretty impressive 60% growth on $1.4 billion in bookings. But, Mike, you mentioned briefly that sales cycle are longer, these deals are getting bigger. Obviously, as you move into more domains, the deals are going to get more complex. Can you just frame out a little bit on how that changes sales cycles or seasonality, if at all, or do you still go-to-market kind of on a domain-by-domain basis, and hence you wouldn't see much change in the sales cycle? Michael Scarpelli : So what I had said is, I was reminding people that these are long sales cycles. They are not getting any longer, but still, they are not short is my point there. I think you're going to see the normal seasonality that you see in most software companies that we tend to have very large Q4s and a fairly big Q2, Q1 and Q3 are the more challenging quarters. And that's been the same that we've always seen and I think that will continue. As we get bigger, you'll see more seasonality in billings with that Q1 being a down quarter. And as you can see from my guide, we're guiding slightly down from where we were this past quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Tim Klasell : I just have a one quick question here and sort of a follow-on from some of the prior questions. We're noticing amongst your installed base that, as you become broader they are beginning to hook-in some other solutions around operations or security to trigger a service request. Are you noticing that? And are there any particular partners or integrations where you think you're providing extra value? Michael Scarpelli : That's actually a very good observation. As I said earlier, fundamentally, when you strip away the veneer and the jargon and the rhetoric, we are a structured workflow and orchestration platform. So essentially, we manage work and we change the way work is managed. Work these days doesn't come from people, it comes from system. So for example, in the area of security, when security events are raised by something like Splunk, for example, which is a very good partner of ours, it automatically triggers a structured workflow on ServiceNow, right, because that's how the systems are working. Something happens in one part of the organization and it triggers actions and orchestrations in another part of the organization. Once you start looking more closely, you see endless opportunities for this sort of thing. It can happen at a very high level, where you get very, very close to the business itself or you get very deep in the infrastructure like as related to security events, for example, that are very arcane in nature and actually difficult to understand. So it's actually the applicability of this core set of capabilities is very deep and very broad. And if you stay involved with it, you'll see more and more of this variety and diversity. Tim Klasell : And is there any way to monetize it or is it something that customers just sort of expect to be part of the platform? Michael Scarpelli : Well, we are monetizing, right. We're monetizing on the ITOM side on the basis of devices or notes and on the service management we're monetizing on the user. So any time more devices physical or virtual are involved, we gain, and the more people get involved, we gain. Eventually, everybody in enterprise will be trusting ServiceNow, and our whole game is just to increase the density of that surface fabric, where people are using this for more and more and more things to get through the day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Siti Panigrahi : This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. I wanted to ask about orchestration and discovery product. Just wondering what kind of traction you are seeing within your installed base? And what sort of opportunity we should think about going forward? Frank Slootman : That was about 10% of our business in Q4, I believe. As I mentioned earlier, it had almost 200% growth, sort of much faster growth than the rest of the business, and it's happening without it being a core focus of our sales organization. We're actually going to put a lot more wood behind that arrowhead. We think the addition of ServiceWatch, the product that we acquired from Neebula last summer, is going to help really charge that business, because it's going to become so much richer in value as a function of that addition. So we're very excited to be in that business, because the ServiceNow platform is just an ideal leverage in jump off point for us to be in that feature set. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Scarpelli for closing remarks. End of Q&A Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir. Michael Scarpelli : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our Chief Executive Officer. Our press release and a simultaneous broadcast of this call can be accessed at investors.servicenow.com. We will make forward-looking statements on this conference call such as those using the words may, will, expects, believes, or similar phrases, to convey that information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Total revenues for the first quarter were $212 million. The quarter was marked by solid demand from our existing customer base, with a 97% renewal rate and a 32% upsell rate. We booked eight new transactions with annualized contract value above $1 million. The company now has 168 customers with an annualized contract value in excess of $1 million. We also landed 23 net new Global 2000 customers, bringing our total to 545, including Illumina, a global leader in gene sequencing and array based technologies; Southern Company, a premier energy company based in Atlanta; the National Bank of Canada; Wolseley, a leading supplier of building materials; and Lennar, one of the nation\u2019s largest home builders. As our customers expand their use of ServiceNow, we see them using our solutions not just to support the business, but increasingly, to actually run the business. H&R Block Canada stood up a new application on ServiceNow during the quarter, just in time for tax season. The company used ServiceNow to support their annual field office readiness, providing the executive team with a dashboard view of the work associated with preparing 600 stores for tax season. The success of that program kicked off additional ServiceNow projects they will be pursuing over the coming year. The U.S. Postal Service created a stamp fulfilment application on ServiceNow with Accenture Federal Services in just 21 days. That application allows the agency to better manage the inventory of more than 20 billion stamps based on local customer demand at 34,000 retail locations. This helps the Postal Service minimize the disposal of unused stamps, directly impacting the agency\u2019s $7 billion in stamp sales. During the first quarter, we launched our latest software feature release, extending service management across the enterprise to marketing, legal, and finance. This release allows business functions to configure their own services and workflows with dedicated analytics and dashboards. For many of our customers, the objective is to create an integrated service experience across all departments and enterprise functions. We helped AAA Allied Group reduce their reliance on email across eight different departments. The customer has said that any interaction with the business will go through ServiceNow. Their marketing department is using ServiceNow to manage creative service requests, taking that service out of email to provide a more efficient and structured workflow. Our latest release also provides a new financial management application to help organizations better understand the costs associated with delivering a service. ServiceNow Financial Management gives CIOs an interactive dashboard that maps IT costs imported from the general ledger due to consumption of services, allowing them to drive dynamic cost allocation around an arbitrary IT tax. During the quarter, we also acquired a company called Intreis to help us develop our solutions in the governance, risk, and compliance segment. We see an opportunity to change the way organizations manage risk by running their compliance process on ServiceNow. We\u2019ve already helped the emergency services/telecommunications authority in Australia transform their audit and risk function. According to the customer, this initiative reduced the collection time for critical compliance data by 93%. Before closing, please be advised of our upcoming annual conference, Knowledge 15, which will take place in Las Vegas next week. We expect approximately 9,000 attendees to share experiences and learn how others achieve success with ServiceNow. At Knowledge 15, we will also be hosting CreatorCon, our first conference specifically aimed at application developers. CreatorCon is part of a broader launch of programs to build a community of highly skilled ServiceNow developers. This will be open to customers, partners, as well as ISVs. To help those partners and developers monetize their work, we will also be launching the ServiceNow Store. The store is our marketplace for applications and services developed on the ServiceNow platform.

Finally, as part of Knowledge 15, we will be holding our annual financial analyst day on April 20. This event is highly recommended to ServiceNow followers and investors, and we look forward to seeing you there. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, Frank. During today\u2019s call, we will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q2 and full year 2015. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release, filed earlier today, and, for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $212 million, an increase of 52% year over year and 62% in constant currency. Subscription revenues for the quarter were $180 million, growing 53% year over year and professional services and other revenues were $32 million, growing 48% year over year. At the beginning of 2015, we changed our customer count methodology. Previously, as defined in our SEC filings, we counted all production instances as separate customers, meaning some logos were counted as multiple customers if they had more than one instance in production. Under our new methodology, we count each logo once, regardless of the number of production instances. Although individual production instances are often separate sales cycles and sold by different sales reps, we feel that this new methodology is more intuitive and gives better insight into our business and key operating metrics. This change in methodology impacts total customer count, upsell rate, revenues per customer, number of customers paying greater than $1 million in ACV, and average contract terms. Each of these metrics have been restated for historical periods and are available in our quarterly IR deck at investors.servicenow.com. Our total customer count, excluding express customers, was 2,461 at the end of the first quarter under our new customer count methodology, and was 2,872 under our previous methodology. Our upsell rate was 32% for the quarter under our new customer count methodology and 25% under our previous methodology. Our total revenues per customer for the trailing four quarters were $345,000 under our new customer count methodology, an increase of 21% from the prior year. Our total revenues per customer for the trailing four quarters under our previous methodology was $298,000. We now have 168 customers under our new customer count methodology that pay us more than $1 million in annualized contract value, up 75% from 96 in the same period last year, and up 10% from 153 in the previous quarter. Under our previous methodology, we have 143 customers that pay us more than $1 million in annualized contract value. Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells, and renewals were 29.7, 22.5, and 23.6 months, respectively, under our new customer count methodology and 29.6, 20.3, and 26.3 months, respectively, under our previous methodology. Our annualized contract value per Global 2000 customer was $746,000 for the quarter, up 34% from the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Total revenues based on geography were $149 million in North America, $48 million in EMEA, and $15 million in Asia Pacific and other, representing 70%, 23%, and 7% of total revenues, respectively. Our non-GAAP billings, calculated as revenue plus change in deferred revenue from the statement of cash flows, was $268 million in the quarter, increasing 48% year over year and 59% in constant currency. As a reminder, we price and invoice in local currencies. Approximately 30% of our first quarter billings were in foreign currencies. Our weighted average subscription billings term was 11.8 months for the first quarter, compared to 12 months in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter, subscription gross margin was 81%, compared to 76% in the prior year. Professional services and other gross margin was 9%, compared to 10% in the prior year. Overall, gross margin was 70% compared to 66% in the prior year. Operating margin was 3% compared to negative 5% in the prior year. We ended the quarter with 3,047 total employees, an increase of 944 from the same period in the prior year and an increase of 221 from the prior quarter. Full details of our quarterly headcount adds by department are available in our quarterly IR presentation. Net income for the first quarter was approximately $2 million or $0.02 per basic and $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $11 million, or negative $0.08 per basic and diluted share in the prior year. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 152 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 166 million. During the first quarter, we generated $67 million in cash flow from operations and we used $27 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $40 million free cash flow. This compares to $13 million of free cash flow in the same period of the prior year. We ended the quarter with $999 million in cash, short term, and long term investments. Our total deferred revenue balance was $463 million at the end of the first quarter, up 10% over the $422 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. Let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2015, based on current FX rates. For the second quarter 2015, we expect total revenues between $237 million and $242 million, represented year over year growth between 42% and 45%. We expect subscription revenues between $192 million and $196 million and professional services and other revenues between $45 million and $46 million. Our professional services and other revenues outlook includes $11 million related to knowledge, with the related expenses of $23 million recorded in sales and marketing. We expect billings between $260 million and $265 million, representing year over year growth of 38% and 41%. We expect subscription margins of 80%; professional services and other gross margins, excluding knowledge, of 15%; and overall gross margins of approximately 70%. We expect an operating loss of approximately $5 million, including net expenses of $12 million related to our knowledge conference. We expect free cash flow of approximately $40 million. For the full year 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $970 million to $1 billion, representing year over year growth of between 42% and 47%. Our total annual revenue estimate consists of subscription revenues between $820 million and $840 million, and professional services and other revenues between $150 million and $160 million. We expect approximately 5% operating margin for the year and to end the year with approximately $180 million fully diluted gross shares outstanding, which includes all basic shares, stock options, and RSUs outstanding before applying the Treasury stock method. With that, operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Lowe : Mike, the first question I had was for you. And in particular, I wanted to look at the billings calculation methodology a little bit. I think a lot of us in the past have been looking at it as a change in deferred off the balance sheet, and I think that was what was in guidance too. This time around, it looks like now you\u2019re switching to look at it on a cash flow basis. So one, I just wanted to verify that\u2019s sort of how you\u2019re going to be thinking about it going forward, and two, can you talk a little bit about why you look at that as being a more appropriate way to calculate billings? Michael Scarpelli : This quarter, FX really impacted us quite a bit, given the movement you saw. I think the euro was around 1.21 at the end of December. It\u2019s down to 1.08 now. And we saw a lot of movement. Remember, 30% of our billings are in foreign currencies as well. Our international operations, our functional currency is the euro, so that really impacts us quite a bit. And as a result, we think it\u2019s more meaningful to factor in that FX, and you picked that up in the cash flow statement. And going forward, that is the way that we will do it. Historically, there wasn\u2019t that much of a difference between the two. Jennifer Lowe : And then maybe just rolling that forward a little bit further, I know in the past, when you\u2019ve given the full year guidance, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the assumption of FX headwinds on revenue. Could you just give us a little bit more color on what you think the FX impact is baked into the billings guidance for Q2, and then the full year revenue guidance? Michael Scarpelli : We took down our internal plan for the balance of the year approximately an additional $6 million based upon just our backlog in deferred revenue for revenue. There\u2019s also, remember, a big chunk of our new business is in foreign currencies, and that\u2019s reflected as well in the guidance that we gave. But specifically, for backlog and deferred revenue, it was about another $6 million as of March 31 that we took out of our revenue plan. In terms of the billings, I don\u2019t have that exact number. That\u2019s based upon current FX rates today, the billings guidance that we\u2019re giving. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Mike, wondering, similar to Jennifer\u2019s question on the Q2, I guess one kind of rule of thumb I might use is that the currency impact for billings on Q1 would sort of roll into Q2, and you\u2019d see a similar impact in Q2. First of all, does that make sense? Michael Scarpelli : If the FX rates stay where they are without moving such that our weighted average exchange rate and our balance sheet rate at June equals what it is at March 31, there\u2019ll be no impact. Walter Pritchard : There\u2019ll be impact on a year over year basis, though. Michael Scarpelli : A year over year basis, but I mean in terms of the guidance that we\u2019re giving. Walter Pritchard : And then Frank, for you, just on the app store and ISVs as a customer of your platform and so forth, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about how important that app store is to getting ISVs onboard and generally how important ISVs are as you think about developing your platform as a revenue opportunity in the future? Frank Slootman : They\u2019re very important, because we view the ISV strategy as a way to really increase the breadth and depth of our platform deployments in large enterprises all around the world. We\u2019ve been pretty good at really spreading our platform through the sale of our own applications and a lot of our partner activity and so on, but content is what drives platform adoption. We always say we\u2019re applications led, we\u2019re platform driven and enabled, so content is really, really key. One of the ways we really think we\u2019re going to unleash that torrent of content is through the ISV community. So the store is really a monetization feature. I think we have a very good routes to market for ISVs in terms of our conferences and our programs and so on, but they have to have the ability to get their content in front of our customer base and then be able to monetize it. In terms of revenue, yes, there is a revenue component in terms of selling through the store, but that is not principally how we\u2019re gonna get paid. We\u2019re gonna get paid on the platform licenses. Effectively, you can think of them as run times. Every time a third party piece of content is sold, that will trigger, in most situations, incremental platform licenses as well. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Michael Turits : Mike, I just wanted to come back to the currency question. You told us what the incremental was, but can you just be specific about what is the year over year revenue headwind total that you expect for Q2 and for the year that\u2019s baked into guidance? And then the way I calculate it for this current quarter, you came in maybe twice what I would have expected, so is there something that would have caused that to be? Michael Scarpelli : Remember, going into Q1 guidance, we had already told people that we took our revenue down for FX. Cumulatively, from when we started planning in the end of Q3 2014, we\u2019ve taken out almost $40 million out of our 2015 plan because of FX. But that was based upon where the rates were back in September. Specifically, when we went into the Q1 call, at that time, the rate had already dropped to 1.12, and we had already lowered our guidance for 2015, partly on that. And as I just mentioned, we just took another $6 million out of our number for the balance of this year as a result. Specifically, FX associated with our backlog in deferred revenue we had. But there\u2019s an incremental piece based upon the new business that we plan on booking, because we quota people in local currencies as well, too, around the world. Michael Turits : Is it possible to just tell us what the revenue headwind is total year over year, not where you were, but versus - or where you were versus what the revenue headwind was? Michael Scarpelli : Year over year, it\u2019s going to be about $40 million, ballpark, which is conservative. I think it\u2019s actually a little bit higher than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Mike, just for Q2 on the billings guide, is there anything else other than FX we should keep in mind in terms of the sequential Q1, Q2 guide down on billings? And I\u2019m just curious, just as it relates to the big deals, you were down year over year on the deals over a million. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s different this year in terms of how those deals are coming through? And I would assume the pipeline\u2019s pretty good for the large deals, but if you could give us a little more color that would be helpful. Michael Scarpelli : You know, as we\u2019ve told people before, these are very long sales cycles, and they tend to be lumpy. Our linearity in Q1, it was very back end loaded. There were a number of deals that slipped as we always have, that slip from one quarter to the next. And we\u2019re off to a fast start this quarter, but we like to see a little bit more into Q2 before we change our outlook going forward for the balance of the year. We\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we gave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne : Mike, just maybe a follow up back on Mike Turits question, just on the year over year hit from FX. If I think about it, obviously [$3] million is about 4% headwind. Obviously, this quarter is almost a 10% headwind on revenue. So is the assumption that the gap between recorded and constant currency should close over the course of the year, assuming that the euro doesn\u2019t get materially worse. Is that a fair way of thinking about it? So that we [wouldn\u2019t] see as big a gap between, say, reported revenue and reported billings in constant currency? Michael Scarpelli : You\u2019re still going to have constant currency headwinds when you do the comparison for future quarters, but our guidance that we\u2019re giving, if we don\u2019t see deterioration in the Europe, should be more in line. Kirk Materne : And just in terms of you guys obviously had an incredibly strong finish to the year. I know you mentioned the first quarter was a little bit more back end loaded seasonally. Did you guys get off to a slower start, or is it just as [indiscernible], it\u2019s just more you guys getting into longer, bigger deals, just the deals cycles extend and just have quarters that might be more back end weighted? Frank Slootman : As Mike said, we were off to a slow start, because we had sort of a hyperbolic Q4, which is great. But unfortunately, we hit January, you know, a lot of business gets pulled forward and it just takes time for the sales teams to build the pipeline back up, so it then starts pushing the business all the way to the back end of March as well as past it. We had quite a bit of deal slip, but the good news is actually that literally when we turned the corner into April, that all started to close in rapid fashion. We\u2019ve already closed more than half in the first two weeks of April [of our push] and we expect to get most or all of it before this month is out. So we\u2019re not terribly concerned. The quarterly patterns are sometimes difficult in our business, because our sales cycles are long. And it\u2019s much easier to sort of view things in six month increments, because it normalizes out, this kind of aberration. You know, our customers don\u2019t really care whether they do it in March or April. Obviously, our sales teams do, because that\u2019s how we incentivize them, but obviously, we can\u2019t get too excited about it. We think that structurally, our business is very, very sound, but sometimes things bounce from this side of the line versus that side of the line. And our deals, we don\u2019t lose them, they don\u2019t go away. And we do close them. Sometimes, they just bounce outside of the quarter. So we\u2019re feeling good about the way our business is developing, but we definitely saw quite a bit of friction in Q1. And it\u2019s kind of hard to know if it was because we were a little light on mature pipeline or if it was due to other factors. We\u2019re reading the tea leaves a little bit, looking at other companies, what they were experiencing. But on the whole, especially what we saw in April, we\u2019re feeling quite good about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs. Greg Dunham : I guess following just up on that, how would you characterize the pipeline today, looking towards the end of the year versus what it was a year ago? Frank Slootman : Actually, feeling much better about it going into April versus going into January. Q1, as those of you that have followed us ever since the IPO, it\u2019s always a tough quarter, because Q4 is so strong. And that\u2019s just the nature of our business. But yeah, the June quarter is our historical Q4, when our fiscal year was June, so both the Q2 and Q4 have always been our strong seasonal quarters. So we\u2019re feeling good coming into this quarter as well as the back half of the year. Greg Dunham : And then Mike, just one more from me. I think what\u2019s a little confusing is the FX, the constant currency adjustment. You know, 30% of your billings and revenue are international. Even if I look at the euro, the depreciation was less than 20%, so I don\u2019t get how you get a 10 point headwind in the quarter, given 30% mix and given less than 20% move in the euro. Can you help walk through where the delta is? Michael Scarpelli : All I know is the detailed calculation that we have to support that, and you can see that coming through the cash flow as well too, by doing the movement there. And the cash flow is at the average rate. Greg Dunham : Okay, we can follow up offline on that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Frank, it\u2019s the first quarter, where you kind of show up like a normal software company, and everyone is now kind of a bit confused. But I would say it\u2019s kind of quite okay to be normal. Just quick question, if you think about the change in momentum in Q1, is it really like plain vanilla, you had a massive Q4 and so the sales pipeline was a little bit empty, so [indiscernible] again, or did you do any changes in terms of kind of getting the [sales guys] kind of to run 10% faster or focus more on different deal sizes, or whatever? Or is it just really like, this is Q1, let\u2019s get on with it? Frank Slootman : I appreciate you asking that question, because we also had a fairly sizable sales realignment and reorg coming into the new year. That happens every year, but this particular year more than half our reps ended up with new account assignments. And what that does is it really dramatizes the effect that we already talked about, because people knew they were going to lose their accounts, so they\u2019re closing like there\u2019s no tomorrow, but they\u2019re also not building the pipeline, because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna get. So the lower you go into the organization, the more they will point to this particular dynamic as being very impactful to the Q1 dynamic. But it\u2019s sort of one time. The reality of our business is we go through a lot of sales reorgs, because the organization expands so rapidly. We have to subdivide territories and we\u2019ve really dramatically increased the focus on the commercial markets. So there were a lot of moving parts between December and January, and as a matter of fact, we were like a mature pipeline coming into the quarter. So that was an additional factor that was at play. Raimo Lenschow : And one follow up there, Frank. If you look at the normal sales org or reorg, it\u2019s kind of one quarter looks really ugly then the next quarter it kind of comes back together, and then you\u2019re back on track in Q3/Q4. Is that kind of the right way to think about it? Frank Slootman : Well, it wasn\u2019t really ugly. This was still our third best quarter ever. I wouldn\u2019t consider that ugly at all. But I do think that the effect of the reorg is a one-quarter event. In that part, I\u2019m agreeing with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg : Frank, I\u2019ve got a product question on performance analytics. When we talk to customers and partners, it seems to be resonating as a killer app or feature. Is there a way to think about the ASP uplift of that product and maybe where you\u2019re seeing some adoption? Frank Slootman : Well, our standard pricing for PA is 20% on our subscription per user fees. It is an important capability for us. Strategically, we\u2019re really moving performance analytics away from standard business intelligence data, warehousing approaches, where people forklift the data to another data structure and then do the reporting over there. We\u2019re really focusing that technology towards real time reporting. We think that\u2019s going to be super differentiated for us, because we are sitting on the data as it changes, and we\u2019re able to represent that in real time or near real time. It\u2019s going to become a very, very important part of our strategy going forward. So performance analytics is a key component. We acquired that technology about a year and a half ago now, almost two years ago. We\u2019ve had good take up. But we\u2019re just in the beginning stages of really running this play. It\u2019s going to get much more significant going forward for our customers and the types of applications people are implementing. Matt Hedberg : And maybe just a quick follow up. Maybe I missed it, but did you give the number of HR or facility wins in the quarter? Frank Slootman : We didn\u2019t. One of the things that we did coming into the year is that we didn\u2019t change our pricing. We do have different SKUing now. We are now just selling one service management SKU, and regardless of whether it\u2019s IT, HR, or any other flavor of enterprise service domain, it\u2019s all the same price. We don\u2019t have the same visibility on the number that is specific to HR or facilities, because our customers are buying them, and they want to have the ability to assign it to whatever department they\u2019re going to be using it for. So we don\u2019t know precisely how they\u2019re using it, whether that\u2019s HR or IT or any other flavor. I think I talked about this in previous calls, but it\u2019s a very important part of how we go to market is to sell it as service management than not specific to IT or HR or any other flavor. We really want our customers to embrace service management for the enterprise, and then they can decide how to allocate it to different service domains. But I will tell you that HR continues to be a very robust, very, very high activity area for us, and that\u2019s going to continue. That\u2019s very exciting for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley : I have just a quick question on the Express product. How quickly does that product deploy versus the flagship product? And maybe could you give us a general sense between the mix of larger companies and smaller companies that are adopting? Frank Slootman : We sort of view Express as a days and weeks for order of magnitude versus weeks and months for what you\u2019d call the flagship product. That\u2019s really the enterprise product. And Express can really go in very, very quickly, because all you have to do is really populate your users and establish their credentials and you\u2019re off to the races. There\u2019s really no design process, workshop. All those concepts, they\u2019re not there. This product is supposed to be used out of the box, so the moment you define the system, everything is on, and you can start using it. That\u2019s why the product is called Express, because it\u2019s really an order of magnitude faster in terms of standing it up. The vast majority of Express users really obviously are smaller enterprises. There\u2019s some mobility between the enterprise products and Express. We\u2019ve seen customers go both directions, which is actually a really good dynamic for us, because we\u2019ve seen a bunch of them graduate to the bigger product. We\u2019ve also seen some of them fall out and needed to go to the smaller product. So we\u2019re really happy to have it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : This may be a bit of an ignorant question, since I\u2019m relatively new to your stock, but it looks like there\u2019s a changing seasonality to your business. I\u2019m going back over the last three years. We just looked at the deferred revenue sequential increase in Q4. It has been getting better and better from 2012 to 2013, to 2014, particularly in 2014, although the current moved pretty severely against you. You had well north of 20% sequential growth there. That\u2019s like 400 or 500 basis points better than you have been in Q4 in other years. And consequently, it\u2019s only natural to expect some more seasonality going into Q1. So is it really that? Of course, you don\u2019t share with us billings forecasts for the year, but as you look at your billings target for the year on a constant currency basis, are there any changes to your expectations, even within a range, albeit. Michael Scarpelli : I\u2019ll say that, as I mentioned before, it was a very back end loaded quarter, and a number of deals slipped into Q2, and we\u2019ve closed a number of those, as Frank mentioned. And so as a result, there\u2019s two things impacting that. There is the deals that got pushed, as well as the FX, which is impacting us. But absolutely, our plan going into the quarter was to be a down quarter. You don\u2019t see it as much in billings, because we have a lot of contracts that we signed in Q4 that start January 1, which don\u2019t get reflected in our billings or deferred revenue but are in backlog going into Q1. And I definitely expect, as we get larger, we will be no different than any other software company. And you\u2019ll see the typical seasonality. Frank Slootman : I think the dynamic you\u2019re talking about, I said earlier, we used to be a June quarter fiscal. And obviously, we changed that a couple of years ago. So that obviously means that Q4 is going to gradually become more prominent if you look at it from a historical standpoint. Kash Rangan : I\u2019m looking at 2012 to 2014. There\u2019s a clear trend where the sequential growth in your deferred revenue used to be 14% to 15% in 2012. Now this Q4 of 2014 was 20%, although the currency moved against you. So there\u2019s clearly a huge shift in your seasonality, it sounds like. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to dovetail into what you\u2019ve been saying, and I appreciate the detail you guys are giving, but maybe\u2026 Michael Scarpelli : We also had such a record Q4 where a lot of deals were pulled from Q1 into Q4 with guys closing. Kash Rangan : So no change with respect to your plan as a business for calendar 2015, I take it? Assuming currencies hypothetically did not change. So you would not have changed your real plans, is what you\u2019re saying, for the year? Michael Scarpelli : [Indiscernible] Kash Rangan : Okay, got it. Thanks. Wonderful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard : Could I ask maybe one thing, and I\u2019m sure you probably want another couple more billings questions on this call, but if you can indulge me for one second. Is there anything else going on, Mike, in terms of seeing some of the trends towards the add on sales just ended up getting billed later in the year. I think you guys [indiscernible] that out on Q2 last year, if I recall correctly. And I\u2019m just curious, is that trend sort of normalizing, or do you see that as you increase cross selling of additional products continuing to push more and more? And is that the seasonality effectively that you\u2019re talking about? Michael Scarpelli : Once again, I think what\u2019s being reflected in Q1 in this seasonality you\u2019re seeing is that Q4 was such a big number. And our sales reps knew they were losing a number of accounts, getting redistributed. So they pulled in every single upsell and deal. That\u2019s really what happened, and there were a number of deals as well that pushed from Q1 into Q2, because of the linearity in our quarter, which we closed a number of those already. Jason Maynard : And then Frank, just a question for you. Your comment around HR case management, having a single service management SKU, I\u2019m just curious, from your standpoint, you guys have been talking about, I\u2019d say, a broadening out of the use cases. You called out marketing, obviously HR. How are you feeling about just sort of the broader applicability into other areas, even like in the external service and support, things like that, where it\u2019s not just the traditional internal help desk, IT [indiscernible]? Frank Slootman : That\u2019s a central theme of our entire strategy, is to really drive service management to an enterprise product. It\u2019s also one of the reasons why we didn\u2019t want to segment our business in terms of all these domains, because there are tons of other service management applications that really don\u2019t sort of fit squarely on a functional department or function. It can just be a single service that\u2019s being provided. And one of the things that we\u2019ve also included - we\u2019re going to show that next week at our conference - is a template for customers to actually build their own customer service management applications. And it\u2019s so highly abstracted and templated that you can auto generate most of the service management applications, because there\u2019s just tons and tons of use cases out there, and we cannot support that all. We\u2019re just picking some of the big service domains out of there to prime the pump, because we know they\u2019re sizable and there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. But there is lots and lots of use cases, which is why we went through this templated automation approach to sort of help people with the tooling to do that, with really no coding skills whatsoever, to be able to stand up those kind of services where you have case management, knowledge management, requests. You get cataloged and everything, where you stand that up automatically for our customers. So the whole notion of managing service is very, very broad based inside the enterprise. It\u2019s actually not limited to the categories that we\u2019ve mentioned. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Just a quick follow up, as it relates to what happened with the sales force, and I had a number of questions from investors who were asking to what degree are the changes this quarter similar to what you\u2019ve done in the past. And in terms of the changes that you made, are those now all settled in and you\u2019re set for the year? Frank Slootman : We\u2019re certainly set for the year, but it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019re set for years, because of the rate that our business grows. And at the rate that we\u2019re bringing on people, the service areas are getting denser and denser, meaning that the whole commercial market, we\u2019re much more aggressive in covering that now, whereas previously we were very much skewed and biased toward the very large enterprise. Now, we have a whole organization dedicated to the commercial accounts, the non-large enterprise accounts. So as we said earlier, this is a very large reorg, and the net result of it was that a lot of people changed their account responsibilities. More than half of them, and that\u2019s just big. It creates a measure of discontinuity in the overall process of generating activity and building pipeline. Brent Thill : Frank, is there a percent that you could put on, just ballpark, what percent of the sales force you actually changed this quarter? Frank Slootman : Yeah, more than half ended up with new account assignments. Brent Thill : In changes net new and overall, that would equate to\u2026 Michael Scarpelli : No, if you look at all the accounts that we had, 50% of those accounts had new sales people covering them, not necessarily new people we hired. But we reorganized and moved accounts around within both our existing sales people and new people that we hired. Frank Slootman : Yeah, the effect of that is that when people know they\u2019re losing accounts, they\u2019re going to take whatever they can off the table. They\u2019ll leave nothing behind for the next guy. That\u2019s natural behavior, and obviously, then, once that happens, the new guys have to start all over again, because nothing was left behind. And when you do that, at the change of the fiscal year, it\u2019s exacerbated, because everybody\u2019s in the accelerators and they're putting everything and anything into it to make sure they maximize their yield on the investment that they\u2019ve made in prior months to develop that business. So that\u2019s the dynamic at play here. But as I said, it\u2019s a one-time thing. Some measure of that we have every year, because of the rapidly growing nature of our business, but this was very pronounced in this particular transition. Brent Thill : So can you just roll that forward then? You would anticipate maybe a quarter or two for that to settle in before you feel that you\u2019re back to full capacity? Frank Slootman : Yeah, we\u2019re past that now. Everybody\u2019s locked and loaded. And as I said, we feel much better about the way the pipeline has been developing coming into April versus coming into January, as you relate it to the numbers that we have to generate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Abhey Lamba : Mike, not to beat a dead horse, just going back to the currency question for a minute, based on what you use for your guidance for the quarter, how much was the additional impact on Q1 revenues and billings? Michael Scarpelli : First quarter revenues themselves were impacted by - it\u2019s actually, if you look at the December 31 rate, our revenues were down $2.7 million in the quarter as a result of where the rate ended up being. In terms of billings, we don\u2019t really try to forecast our billings based upon a forecast currency other than the rate it is when we give our guidance. And so I can\u2019t give you that number specifically, what you\u2019re asking for, on the billing side. The billings is based upon the timing of your invoicing to customers as well, too. And so that can skew quite a bit as well. If we had a lot more billings in the beginning of the quarter, before the rates fell, it would have been a higher number. And if they\u2019re skewed toward the end of the quarter, when the rates had fallen quite a bit, you\u2019d see a lower billing number. Abhey Lamba : And very quickly, the [deals] that slipped from the quarter, were they in any particular region or industry vertical, or have any brought a macro takeaway from those? Or was it all related to your sales force reorg? And a follow up to that is essentially what are you modeling for your close rate for the second quarter? I understand your pipeline is very strong, but what are you thinking of closing versus historical Q2? Frank Slootman : In terms of the deal slip, that\u2019s really an immaturity of pipeline, right? Customers don\u2019t really care whether it\u2019s March or April. And we do not want to resort to unnatural acts to force these things to happen inside March, because it\u2019s going to cost us a lot of money. And as we proved to ourselves in the first two weeks of April, we\u2019ve already closed more than half of them and under normal conditions. So that\u2019s all fine, because our relationships with customers are 10, 15, 20 years, so a couple of weeks is not going to make a whole lot of difference. And we\u2019re really happy with the way that is going. And it\u2019s very much a function of how much mature pipeline we have coming into the quarter. In terms of your close rate, I don\u2019t have an answer for you on that question, because that\u2019s not something that we typically discuss on the call. Michael Scarpelli : The deals that kind of slipped, though, were both in North America and Europe, the ones that have subsequently closed, so there was no specific industry. They were kind of spread across a number. Frank Slootman : What I will say about close rates is we have an exceptionally high close rate in general, but what happens to us, our biggest number one competition is always the push, because these are large transactions. It always depends on whether a customer has the resources and the priority in the organization to undertake it. That is often the driver, why a deal doesn\u2019t happen in the quarter, when a customer just isn\u2019t ready. We don\u2019t lose them to competition. The deals are not going away. But it\u2019s not atypical for us to see transactions not just move one quarter, but move two quarters and sometimes, even three quarters, because they have to be ready to engage on the overall deployment. And it\u2019s not a small commitment. These are really, really big rollouts and goal lines. So that really is the nature of our business. And then you add to that that the March-April dynamic is not super compelling compared to December-January, and this is how it plays out. We\u2019re actually kind of surprised how strong April started, because it was almost a complete reversal of sentiment from where we were in late March. So that was kind of a nice thing to see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Greg McDowell : I guess first, for you Frank, since we\u2019re only three to four days away from the kickoff of your user conference, I was just hoping you could preview some of the main themes and messages you want to get across to the user base. And then Mike, I have a second question for you. Frank Slootman : I don\u2019t know how I can do that in 30 seconds or less. We are going to record our keynote presentations. I really would encourage you to go and watch those, because we\u2019re really laying out our case for what\u2019s possible and what you should aspire to. And the biggest thing about ServiceNow, the platform affords an opportunity to really change the way people work, away from unstructured messaging approaches, which is really email and voice and so on, getting to systems, structured data, structured workflow type of approaches. The opportunity is just immense there in terms of productivity. We really find that there is an incredible productivity frontier in large institutions and enterprises. The one thing we will also see is due next week, is the release of a research study that we\u2019ve undertaken that has attempted to quantify what the effect of that is in terms of time lost and time wasted in organizations. And it\u2019s of such an order of magnitude that we believe that CIOs and senior executives in general will give a high level of priority around dealing with this. And so much of the money always flows to the customer side of the organization, where we touch customers. On the inside, we tend to be generations behind in terms of the opportunity to automate and streamline and really achieve huge productivity gains. So that\u2019s what the conference is about. There\u2019s going to be a lot of announcements. We\u2019re going to show a ton of new product in all our categories. In operations management, on the platform, as I mentioned, where we have the store. We have a brand new developer IDE coming out. And of course in service management, the financial management app, as I talked about in the prepared remarks. So there\u2019s a lot of product that\u2019s going to be released and previewed at the conference. But the mega theme is always around how service management is really changing the way people work in institutions and enterprises. Greg McDowell : And one quick follow up for you, Mike, is I think a question we\u2019re going to get a lot tomorrow is if all these slipped deals have already closed in Q2, or early in April, why does the Q2 billings imply such a slowdown on a constant currency basis? You grew billings 59% in constant currency in Q1, and I know on an as reported basis, you\u2019re guiding to 38% to 41%. But even assuming another 10 point currency headwind, we\u2019re talking about 48% to 51%, so it would seem like there would be the potential with some of these slipped deals already closing that there could be some acceleration on a constant currency basis, instead of the decel that you\u2019ve guided to. So I was just hoping you could expand a little bit on that. Michael Scarpelli : Well, remember, a lot of the billings that we give guidance for is coming out of what\u2019s in our contracted backlog today, as well as the renewal cycle that we have. With our customers, that\u2019s where the bulk of it comes versus new business. And so even if you have deals that push from one quarter to the next, that doesn\u2019t move the billings as much as our backlog billings and renewals. And the guidance we gave is based upon what\u2019s in our backlog of renewals. And it factors in those deals slipping into this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Justin Furby : Frank, I wanted to go back to the reorg. You mentioned that more than half of the accounts saw more change in terms of assignments, but what did that look like a year ago in terms of the percentage? Was it 10%, 20%, 30%? Just trying to get a sense for the magnitude of how pronounced it was. And maybe you said this, but why was it so pronounced this year versus last year? And then Mike, I\u2019ve got a follow up. Frank Slootman : I really can\u2019t quantify what the difference is, because I just don\u2019t know. I just know that this was viewed by our sales organization as huge in terms of the effect that it had on sales activity development and so on. Why was it huge? It\u2019s a very profound reorganization in terms of us allocating resources much more deeply and much more broadly in places where they haven\u2019t been before. As I said already, we have an entire commercial account organization now. A lot of people have been moved around. A lot of global account organization. Because we have added so many people, there is far fewer reps names than there were before. So we have narrowed their focus considerably. Whereas before they might have had 15, maybe they now have five, for example. So those are really, really big changes in an organization. It obviously has a good sized effect on activity development. We don\u2019t want to dwell on it either, because of the way sales people operate. That\u2019s going to take care of itself in fairly rapid order, because they\u2019ve got to eat. Justin Furby : And then, Mike, the billings guidance, if rates would have frozen when you gave guidance in late January, would you have still beat your billings guidance for the quarter? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Justin Furby : Okay. And is there any change, when you look to Q2, in how you\u2019re approaching the guidance? Michael Scarpelli : No, it\u2019s the same approach that we established our guidance going into Q1. We\u2019re applying the same methodology. [indiscernible] the rate\u2019s in effect now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Tim Klasell : Just a quick one here. As we look forward, do you plan, given the growth rates, that you will do the sales force reorg at the same magnitude next year and following year, so we should sort of plan in that sort of seasonality? Or was this year a little bit more exaggerated? Michael Scarpelli : What was really new this year is at the end of 2014, we hired a new VP of commercial sales for the Americas, and this reorg is moving a number of those people directly underneath him, where in the past, all of that, the commercial and the enterprise, was rolling up under one person. We also, halfway through last year, we did hire a head of Americas enterprise sales. Both those two leaders report into our VP of worldwide sales. That\u2019s what created the big reorg that was telegraphed out to people that was going to be happening in January of 2015. And so I don\u2019t expect to have that big of an impact in future years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : Just a couple of cleanup questions. It looks like there was a little outperformance on the gross margin side relative to your guidance. Can you talk through that? And then also, it looked like capex as a percentage of revenue upticked a little bit. Maybe you could offer a little color there. Michael Scarpelli : Yeah, what helped in the subscription margin was the exchange rates, for one thing. And the other thing, just kind of delays in some expenses that we had within our data centers. Remember, one of the reasons why we bill in foreign currencies is we operate data centers around the world, and we have expenses in foreign currencies. So we have a pretty good hedge in place there, but a lot of our data centers, where they were kind of some of our international data centers, are not even close to being at capacity. So when the FX rates do strengthen the U.S. dollar, you\u2019ll see improvements in our gross margins just due to some of those international data center costs coming down in U.S. dollars. And sorry, what was your second question you asked, Karl? Karl Keirstead : Just on the capex, the percentage of revenue looked like it upticked a little bit this past quarter. Michael Scarpelli : It\u2019s really just timing of things happening. As we said, for the full year, we expect it to be roughly, I think we said, about 9% of revenues for the full year, is what we\u2019re expecting. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna. Derrick Wood : So Mike, when I look at the 59% constant currency billings, and I think you said it was 66% last quarter, that doesn\u2019t look like much of a hiccup. But it sounds like there\u2019s a difference between bookings and billings, and bookings growth was probably lower than billings. Is that the right assumption? Michael Scarpelli : I haven\u2019t done the math to try to figure that out, and I\u2019m trying to understand your question more. Derrick Wood : Well, you didn\u2019t see much of a slowdown in billings growth versus Q4. But you know, you\u2019re talking about deal slippage, so I\u2019m just trying to put two and two together. Michael Scarpelli : But a lot of the billings that we have have nothing to do with our current bookings, because a lot of our billings, as I mentioned, come out of our backlog, which we booked already. Derrick Wood : And Frank, as you gear up and are kind of getting more aggressive and moving outside of IT, and maybe this is alongside some of the changes you\u2019re making in the sales force, but are you doing anything different in the go-to-market approach where you look at maybe more specialist overlays or working with partners in a different way to really help move outside of IT? Frank Slootman : One of the things we\u2019ve done in December is we changed our [product] organization away from a functional single product, single market approach to a product line model, where we really now have organizations that can move with multiple products against multiple markets at the same time. So we now have you can call them BUs or product lines that now have product leaders on them. We really did that to be able to increase the focus on markets that otherwise would not get the quality of attention and focus and resources. And particularly, that\u2019s for things like IT operations management, a product like Express. They have their own resources. The platform now has its own organization. So all those teams are going to be developing their own go-to-market capabilities and really driving the sales organization across a much broader front. So that was a substantial change in how we internally operate, but that will begin rippling out to the outside as well over time. This is just starting on the inside in how we work on a day to day basis. But then, it won\u2019t be long, because they are responsible for the go-to-market motions and all the marketing programs, all the partner strategies, etc., that are associated with these individual product lines. So this is really a fairly substantial change, because it really broadens the approach for ServiceNow as a whole. Before, we were very much led by our service management product, because that\u2019s so dominant in the overall mix, and in order for us to make sure the other products are getting adequate resources, that\u2019s why we went to this model. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Egbert with Piper Jaffray. Katherine Egbert : With respect to FX, if I can, is it just a direct FX impact, or are you seeing any areas where you price in U.S. dollars and maybe people are downsizing deal sizes because it\u2019s more expensive? Michael Scarpelli : No, as I said, in most international locations, we\u2019re pricing in local currencies. The major places where we play in are EMEA is euros and pounds. Australia is Australian dollars. Canada is Canadian dollars. In Singapore and others, it\u2019s principally in U.S. dollars, but the bulk of our business internationally is Europe and Australia would be number two. Katherine Egbert : And just without giving any color on HR and facilities and some of the other areas, it makes your addressable market a little bit less clear. What can you tell us about that? Does your addressable market stay the same now that you have one SKU? How do we look at that? Frank Slootman : Well, we view service management as really one market. That\u2019s sort of the net that you should take away from this. Certainly, we can size this marketplace by looking at how many HR people there are in the world, and we\u2019ve done that. And some of that you will find on our investor page, exactly how we arrived at that. But these are not structural changes. These are really positioning changes. Our customers are saying, look, I\u2019m adopting service management. I don\u2019t know how many people I will have in IT versus HR versus any other service domain. So for us to be able to buy one set of service management licenses and for us to be able to deploy them as our needs develop is much more attractive than having them segmented and fragmented into categories. So that\u2019s why that happens. It really has no effect on our addressable market. It\u2019s just how we approach it. Katherine Egbert : And then one last quick one. The acquisition you made, did it add any review this quarter? Michael Scarpelli : No. That\u2019s really a professional service organization, and they came on with about $500,000 in backlog, but that\u2019s still to be performed. It was more getting the people, the domain expertise, for our product management, to further strengthen our GRC application. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Brean Capital. Sarah Hindlian : I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update in terms of what you\u2019re seeing right now in terms of [ITOM] adoption. I know you discussed last quarter seeing about 10% of the business coming from that market, which is still largely unsupported by the sales force. And then two, I\u2019m hoping - and not to beat a dead horse either, but I\u2019m trying to understand the guidance in terms of seeing half of these deals close that were slipped and the assumption of a consistent FX rate from this point on. I\u2019m hoping you could give a little bit of color in terms of the conservativism around this outlook. Michael Scarpelli : In terms of the ITOM, we\u2019re seeing roughly about 10% of our business is ITOM that we\u2019re seeing, and that was consistent with what we were seeing in Q4. In terms of our guidance, our guidance is based upon, as I mentioned before, there is the FX headwind on our existing backlog, but 30% of our business is denominated in foreign currencies. And so our pipeline of opportunities and what our plan was for new business this year is coming down as well, because of the FX associated with that. And the guidance we\u2019ve given is based upon kind of where we\u2019re seeing things right now. And we\u2019re a little bit cautious with how we saw Q1, the linearity. Yes, we\u2019re off to a strong start right now, but we\u2019d like to see a little bit more of that. What I will say is this is the strongest start we\u2019ve ever seen at the beginning of a quarter. But does that mean that\u2019s going to continue throughout the rest of the quarter? We\u2019re going to take a wait and see. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. Alex Zukin : I was wondering, with the sales reorg, is there any change in focus between focusing on new accounts versus kind of existing opportunity, considering you\u2019ve broadened the product set so much? Frank Slootman : We\u2019ve had that orientation since the beginning of 2013. You\u2019ve been with us that long. That\u2019s when we introduced the separation that we have between existing accounts and new accounts. And we have carried that theme through in this new organization, the model. So both from the commercial side and on the enterprise side, there is the delineation between people that take care of existing accounts and the people that are hunting for new logos. So this is now the third year into it that we are organized that way. It\u2019s really important for a SaaS company, because we rely so heavily on renewals and upsells. So that\u2019s how we are, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been, and that\u2019s certainly what we will be going forward. As you know, SaaS companies will become increasingly dependent over time on existing customers. That\u2019s just the nature of the way the model eventually works. So we\u2019re really well set up to be able to run that the way we\u2019re currently organized. Alex Zukin : And Mike, can you just talk a little bit about what drove the upside to cash flow in the quarter? Michael Scarpelli : You know, we had some really, really strong collections in the quarter. We had a number of customers who paid us earlier than we were expecting. That\u2019s one of the things that we noticed. I was surprised at some of the large payments that came in in sub-30 days. Still annual. There was nothing because of multiple year payments, but I can give you one example of one customer that should have paid us in April on 30 days. It was two point something million. I was shocked they paid us in March, within 22 days or something like that of the contract. So it\u2019s just the timing of cash collections is the biggest driver that we saw. Alex Zukin : Are you guys seeing any more evidence of leading with applications outside of IT and HR, in finance and facilities this quarter? Frank Slootman : Well, that\u2019s part of our go-to-market thrust, so our organization is directed and instrumented to campaign our platform, not just in IT. Obviously, we\u2019re going after IT, but there\u2019s many situations where IT, for whatever reason, is not up for grabs. It could be contractual, for whatever reason. So it\u2019s really great that we can go after a human resources department or sometimes just pure platform applications. So we don\u2019t easily strike out. If we can\u2019t go through the front door, we go in through a side door. We have many arrows in the quiver, many clubs in the bag, so to speak, to pursue business. And certainly our sales people like that a lot. We don\u2019t easily strike out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : I actually want to focus on the business here, on the new customer acquisition, from some of the newer applications. Last quarter, you gave some color of some wins outside of your traditional IT customers, folks that weren\u2019t using the IT [indiscernible] product. Wondering if you could give some color on that, what you saw this quarter, what the pipeline looks like for the rest of the year. Frank Slootman : That information is all anecdotal for the reasons that I mentioned earlier, which is now we\u2019re just selling one service management SKU, and we let our customers decide how they use them. And over time, they actually move them around between one service domain, like IT, to another service domain, like facilities. The downside of that, of course, is that we don\u2019t have precise data anymore, whether the uptake is one discipline or another. But the anecdotal evidence is very, very strong, that the uptake in HR is very, very good. And the thing about human resources, we\u2019re not just getting involved in the HR on the service management side either. We\u2019re involved in compensation planning applications, we\u2019re involved in onboarding/offboarding applications. Actually going to show some of that with one of our partners at the conference next week. So HR\u2019s become a whole domain of service management applications, not just the traditional case management, knowledge management, request management, which is what people most associate with what we do. So these areas are getting much more deeper, much broader, than they historically have been understood. The same thing is true in facilities areas as well. There\u2019s capital request planning, there\u2019s not just all the usual request oriented type of applications. So the nice thing about getting time in market for these apps is that we\u2019re getting past the standard service management capabilities into a lot of other interesting areas. That\u2019s just how our business develops. People start understanding what the platform can do for them, and then the new services are being discovered, that are interesting to be stood up on our platform. Philip Winslow : And just obviously building on some of the anecdotal side, because obviously you guys do have that single SKU now, but when you think about sort of the near and the long term, just the end user side here, especially kind of the newer user bases that you\u2019re going after - you\u2019ve obviously talked about HR, field service, facilities management, GRC, you even made an acquisition in GRC - which do you think is a bigger near term opportunity that can drive revenue for you faster versus what\u2019s the bigger, longer term market for you? Frank Slootman : Well, I think that the IT operations management, especially under the influence of our Service Watch product, which we acquired last summer, I think it\u2019s a super important product. There is a ton of interest in the product. There\u2019s a lot of proof of value kind of steps going on. So we\u2019re very excited about that, because it\u2019s the tip of the spear, if you will, for our entire operations management strategy, and it just leverages the services management side absolutely perfectly. So we see that as an important area for us. Service management is such a big area. We got started in IT. Obviously, everybody understands that part of our business. Then we\u2019re getting into adjacent service domains, sometimes referred to as business services. But increasingly, we\u2019re getting involved into, with services now, that actually run the business not just support the business. And I mentioned this in the prepared remarks as well. Next week at conference, we have somebody speaking on how they\u2019re running an admissions process inside a university, which is really more like a CRM application. And in other words, a lot of the boundaries that we\u2019ve traditionally seen between CRM applications and service management applications are becoming much fuzzier. And we\u2019re now involved in take offs against SalesForce and Oracle, and companies like that. Well, you never saw that a few short years ago. So that\u2019s all very existing for us, and that\u2019s why I mentioned the product line reorganization we did last December, because our organizations are really getting in position to drive us down those paths. Operator : And at this time, there are no additional questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call and the broadcast of our financial analyst day will be available as a webcast in the investor section of our website. Thanks for joining us today.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ServiceNow Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mija and I will be your operator for today.

Our press release, our quarterly IR deck and the simultaneous broadcast of this call can be accessed at investors.servicenow.com. We may make forward-looking statements on this conference call such as those using the words may, will, expect, believes, pipeline, prospects, or similar phrases to convey that this information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for information on risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. Total revenues for the second quarter were $247 million, up 48% over the same period last year. During the quarter we saw strong renewals at 97% and healthy upsells at 43%. We recorded nine new transactions with ACV above $1 million. The company now has 186 customers with ACV in excess of $1 million, a 68% increase from last year. This reflects both new customers with larger initial contracts as well as customers who expanded their use of ServiceNow. We also landed 21 new Global 2000 customers including Caterpillar, Novo Nordisk and Alliant Energy. One of our existing Global 2000 customers, a financial institution, signed our largest upsell transaction ever with ACV in excess of $6 million. They are focused on modernizing service by providing employees with an online user experience and structured workflow for managing requests across the entire bank. This initiative was driven by the CEO with a vision to transform the entire organization. During Q2, we saw strong performance of the emerging products that are outside our core service management offerings. Our Performance Analytics solutions had a quarterly record for new customers and ACV including its single \u2013 its largest single transaction ever. The ACV for our IT operations management portfolio nearly doubled year-over-year driven by 21 deals larger than $100,000. The ServiceWatch solution had a record quarter and was our best performing product in the ITOM portfolio with strong interest from our existing customer base. On the heels of our acquisition of Intr\u00e9is, our GRC solution recorded its largest transaction with ACV of nearly $2 million and growing interest from our existing customers. During the quarter, our ServiceNow Express product landed 74 new customers including its largest. Seven of our existing Express customers upgraded to our enterprise version in Q2. We also booked the first transactions for our new financial management application with six customers and a robust pipeline of pilots and prospects. Finally, we set new attendance records at our Knowledge15 conference in Las Vegas with more than 30% growth. Our conference is branching out beyond the boundaries of IT with 25% of the breakout sessions focused on topics outside of IT. Our inaugural developer conference, CreatorCon, exceeded our expectations with nearly 1,500 registered professional developers and application architects. We certified more than 400 developers at the event. Since we launched our CreateNow Developer Program, we have nearly 10,000 sign-ups and provision more than 4,000 developer instances, an essential resource to help developers learn and build market applications on the ServiceNow platform. To help these developers monetize their applications, we also launched the ServiceNow Store. We now have 96 applications and integrations published on the store with almost as many in the pipeline going through certification. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Frank. During today's call we will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q3 and full year 2015. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results, in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investor.servicenow.com. Our total revenues for the second quarter were $247 million, increasing 48% year-over-year and 59% in constant currency, an $18 million FX impact. We now have 186 customers that pay us more than $1 million in annualized contract value, an increase of 18 customers or 11% quarter-over-quarter and 75 customers or 68% year-over-year. Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells and renewals were 31.1, 26.0 and 22.6 months respectively. Our annualized contract value per Global 2000 customer as of Q2 was $804,000, up 34% from the prior year and up 7% from the prior quarter. Total revenues based on geography were $174 million in North America, $56 million in EMEA and $17 million in Asia-Pacific and Other, representing 71%, 22% and 7% of total revenues respectively. Our calculated billing is using the change in deferred revenue from the statement of cash flows was $281 million in the quarter increasing 50% year-over-year and 62% in constant currency, a $23 million FX impact. We also noted that several analysts and investors continue to calculate our billings using the change in deferred revenue from the balance sheet. As we previously mentioned calculated billings derived from the statement of cash flows better aligns with our actual billings. Our foreign currency statement of cash flows translate into U.S. dollars using average quarterly FX rate where our foreign currency balance sheets translate into U.S. dollars using a spot rate at the end of the quarter. We bill throughout the quarter so the calculated billings using an average FX rate from the statement of cash flows better represents and is consistently closer to our actual billings. Our weighted average subscription billings term was 12.2 months for the second quarter compared to 11.7 months in the prior year. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 82% compared to 78% in the prior year. Professional services and other gross margin was 38% compared to 34% in the prior year. This includes $11 million of revenue related to Knowledge while all related expenses run through sales and marketing. Excluding the Knowledge revenue our professional services and other gross margin was 19% compared to 13% in the prior year. Our overall gross margin was 74% compared to 69% in the prior year. Excluding the Knowledge revenue overall gross margin was 72% compared to 67% in the prior year. Operating margin was 6% compared to negative 3% in the prior year, including net expenses of $10 million related to Knowledge. We ended the quarter with 3,187 total employees, a net increase of 140 from the prior quarter. We continue to expect between 850 and 900 net employee additions in 2015. Net income for the second quarter was $7 million or $0.05 per basic and $0.04 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $9 million or negative $0.07 per basic and diluted share in the prior year. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 154 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 168 million. During the second quarter, we generated $79 million in cash flow from operation and we used $15 million for capital expenditures resulting in $64 million in free cash flow. This compares to $26 million of free cash flow in the prior year. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments. Let's turn to guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2015 based on FX rates as of the end of Q2. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues between $252 million and $257 million representing year-over-year growth between 41% and 44% and between 49% and 52% in constant currency, an approximately $14 million FX impact. We expect subscription revenues between $216 million and $220 million and professional services and other revenues between $36 million and $37 million. We expect billings between $280 million and $285 million representing year-over-year growth between 35% and 37% and between 42% and 45% in constant currency, an approximately $15 million FX impact. We expect subscription gross margins of approximately 80%, professional services and other gross margin of approximately 14% and overall gross margin of approximately 71%. We expect an operating margin of approximately 8% and free cash flow of approximately $35 million. For full year 2015, we expect total revenues between $985 million and $1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 44% and 47% and between 52% and 55% in constant currency, and approximately $54 million FX impact. Our total annual revenue estimates consists of subscription revenues between $830 million and $840 million and professional services and other revenues between $155 million and $160 million. We expect full year 2015 billings of approximately $1.2 billion representing year-over-year growth of approximately 41% and approximately 49% in constant currency, an approximately $70 million FX impact. We expect approximately 6% operating margin for the full year and to end the year with approximately 180 million fully diluted gross shares outstanding, which includes all basic shares, stock options and RSUs outstanding before applying the treasury stock method. As a final reminder, we've included a high-level reconciliation of constant currency for Q2 results and guidance in the Appendix of our quarterly investor deck posted at investors.servicenow.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Mike, just on the billings guide, I'm curious, obviously the constant currency you gave was a healthy metric. But anything else that you're looking at that's having an impact as it relates to how you look at billings? And realizing you've got the FX headwinds and the bigger comp from last year. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : No, a lot of it has to do with timing of renewals and other things and billing our backlog. And remember, the biggest chunk of our billings is actually billing our contracted backlog and based upon the historical billings terms that they had, as well as new renewals that we do. And it does get impacted. There is potential upside in any quarter in billings if you're able to pull some renewals into a current quarter with upsells. And we just don't forecast that. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And maybe for Frank, just as it relates to the traction among the Global 2000. You continue to make very good progress there. I'm curious if you could just shed what you're seeing as it relates to some of the larger enterprise contracts and how you think about the pipeline in the back half of the year. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Feeling good about it, Brent. I mean, we've consistently been skewed toward the very large enterprise in our business more and more so over the last several years. And we continue to do well there. It's not just the new logos that we're landing; it's also that our footprint in the Global 2000 logos that we already have continues to expand very nicely. It's really a key part of our strategy to land in those enterprises and then grow our footprint in them. And it's one of the reasons why we highlighted the traction that we're having with our emerging products, because that all flows into those large institutions as well. So it's really an ongoing opportunity for the company to sell new and existing products. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, you obviously launched a store at the customer conference. Can you give us any initial feedback you've seen from customers and partners? Thank you. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Raimo, people have been pretty happy with the fact that we have a monetization feature in our community at this point. As you know, we had our Share facility, allows people to upload and share contact. But what's new of course is the ability to monetize. It really becomes a route to market for professional software developers, people that not just build software for a living, but also have to sell it for a living. So it's really opened things up. It really goes hand-in-hand with a bigger program that we have to attract professional developers to our platform. That's why we made a whole bunch of other announcements around it as well. So, we signed up 10,000 developers to the program. We're now provisioning developer instances to developers for free. All we need is an email address. So we've really lowered the bar to allow people to come in, stay a while, learn, really explore and experience what it's like to be on our platform. I think the store is just sort of one aspect of that overall strategy for us. And so far it's been well received. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. And one quick one for Mike. Your gross margins are trending obviously nicely in the right direction. Could you just talk about the puts and takes you see there for the second half, please? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : The second half is really just as we continue to expand within some of our data centers, there is some new capacity coming online that's going to hit us with depreciation. And that's reflected. And also, we plan on stepping up some of our hiring in second half of the year within both our support and our cloud infrastructure. That will negatively impact the subscription margin line, hence why we guided to 80% from the 82% that we achieved last quarter. But long term, I will reiterate the guidance we gave at our Analyst Day, long term we see the leverage we'll be able to get out of our subscription line. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Lovely. Thank you. Well done. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Very nice quarter, guys and thank you for taking the question. Just in terms of the sales re-org at the beginning of the year, it looks like any sort of issues in terms of getting people online have been solved. Can we just get an update there? Do you guys feel comfortable that those issues have been smoothed over and the sales force is operating as expected or as you'd planned on a go-forward basis? And then related to that, on the hiring front, given that you haven't changed your targets for the full year, it seems like you have a lot of work to do in terms of hiring to the back half of the year. To what extent are you having issues or having trouble sort of meeting the targets for sales hiring in particular? Are you on target there? And does that have any impact, is there any supply constraint, if you will, or capacity constraint on the business based upon hiring? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so, Keith, this is Frank. On the re-org, as we emphasized during the quarter, this is something that straightens itself out in the normal course of business. And, for example, the big re-org was to really split our organization between enterprise business and commercial business. And we saw our commercial between Q1 and Q2 grow sequentially about 72%, which really is a fairly healthy indicator that things are normalizing and straightening themselves out. So we think that's really behind us. In terms of your other question, hiring obviously is an enormous responsibility and a huge task that we have every quarter to bring so many people on in all different categories that we're hiring. We were certainly under where we would have liked to have been in Q2, but we reiterated our guidance for the full year. So we have not backed off of our intentions to hire in all the categories. So, obviously having things like big conferences like Knowledge in the mix doesn't help, but we had a good start on hiring coming into Q3 and we'll have to pedal down for the rest of the year. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much. Frank, I was just wondering along with the launch of the store, obviously you guys are trying to build out more of an ISV community on top of your platform. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how that's going and what we should maybe be thinking about in terms of seeing some ISVs sign up to build more, I guess, discrete solutions on top of the platform. And then, Mike, I was wondering if you could just talk about the government business. Last year you guys had a really strong third quarter. Just what are your expectations heading into what is obviously a strong seasonal time for the government? Thanks. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Kirk, there's really no update beyond what I talked about in the prepared remarks. It's very early going. This sort of thing has a slow fuse on it and we've really started seeding the marketplace with developer programs, with free developer instances. As I said, we're approaching 100 absent integrations on the store. There's another number like that in the pipeline. So we're at the very beginning, I feel in terms of that entire process and before people fully sign-up, fill the applications are ready to go to market, quite a bit of time goes, but you got to get started and that's what we've done here. So we'll be updating you in future calls on where are with this. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : And on the federal government, Kirk, as you know, Q3 generally is one of the stronger quarters for the federal government and as of right now, it looks like we will have a good quarter, but we really don't talk about individual lines of business in terms of segmentation, how they do. But as you know, we've had the big investment in our federal organization, not just on the sales side, but our data center, so we're very hopeful long term that will be very meaningful for us. Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks for the color. Congrats on the results. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Co. Please proceed. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys and congrats. I wanted to ask about rep productivity. Frank, you talked about it as a bit sequentially, but on a year-on-year basis within the entire sales team, what did you see from a productivity standpoint? And then, on hiring side of things, it sounds like no change, is that the same with the sales rep side of things in terms of your expectations of hire for full year? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. In terms of our reps in our sales and when we talk about head count, we always talk about sales and marketing headcounts in total. And we are continuing to add with what we've said before and that's not changing. In terms of productivity, we did see an increase in productivity sequentially from Q1 to Q2 which we're very pleased with and it was pretty much flat from the year ago quarter. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And what about \u2013 you called out the revenue side on the \u2013 from geography, but from a new business standpoint was there anything that was particularly strong, weak across Europe, U.S., APAC that stood out? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : From a geography standpoint? No. It was pretty much consistent as you saw on our revenue side. Some of our big deals, I will say, that big financial institution we talked about was the European one. And so upsells were very strong in EMEA and we are pleased with our results in Asia Pacific as well last quarter. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then, just one last one on free cash flow, I think at your Analyst Day you kind of up $160 million as sort of a proxy for this year, it seems like you're tracking well above that. I know you're not necessarily guiding to it, but what's the right way to think about growth and free cash flow, looking out the back of this year and then over the next few years relative to maybe your P&L or is there anything else? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Stay tuned for long-term guidance on free cash flow in January for 2016. We really don't give long-term guidance there and as we said earlier we're expecting about $35 million in free cash flow in Q3. And one of the reasons it's down quite a bit from the $65 million, we just did is, as we mentioned at our Analyst Day, we're off to a very strong start in Q2. And as a result we did a lot of billing early in the quarter and collected where historically we would have done the billing in the quarter and collected in Q3 for instance. So that's one of the reasons why our free cash flow is there, but we're very pleased and we're tracking well ahead of where we thought we would be at this time in the year and for the full year. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys and congrats. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Michael Turits. Mike, the \u2013 during the re-org there were some changes I think in the way that you rolled up the pipe and looked at visibility and adjustments that had to be made there. Where are we and do you feel like you've got visibility back where we want it? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : As Frank mentioned, we're very pleased with what we saw, the growth in our commercial business. And we think it's back to where it needs to be right now and we think that's behind us now but obviously time will tell. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, I'm not sure if it was in the prepared remarks, Frank, but did you mention platform licenses and where you are with those or progress you made in getting those going? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, it was not in the prepared remarks. The thing that, I keep emphasizing, all of the ServiceNow business is platform business, right? It's only one thing. You're referring specifically to the licenses for custom bespoke applications, which is something separate. We did not disclose the data. I don't have that on me either. But that continues to do very well. I mean, we have 85% of our customers have \u2013 on average, 6.5, 7 applications deployed on our platform. It's just something that's very part and parcel on virtually all of our customers, the way they use our platform. And they have a lot of services on there that are standard that they buy from us and then there are a lot of services they either built themselves or they have partners built for them. So that continues very well. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could give us, I know you would have a single \u2013 a single SKU now, but to sort of some color on feedback from both existing and potential customers on field service management, HR, just the newer functionality to the platform? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so \u2013 this is Frank \u2013 you're correct, I mean, we've really made a strong push to SKU ourselves around service management to allow customers to really embrace that enterprise wide enough for us to \u2013 for them to have to keep track of licenses that they use for IT versus human resources versus facilities and so on. The downside of that, of course, is we don't necessarily know what people are using it for, how they're moving it around. We just know anecdotally that human resources is still by far the area outside of IT that has the most traction and that is reporting a lot of resources behind that as well. We're very optimistic about the momentum that we have in those areas. Some of the others are trailing behind that in terms of procurement, facilities, legal, marketing, you mentioned field management. There's obviously a lot of other areas. One of the things that we released in our \u2013 in the current release of our software is a setup template capabilities to allow people to stand up their own service management applications, because it's a very, very fragmented business in the sense that there's all kind of service domains that people can build service management capabilities for. So it's not always as discrete and big bucketed as it is with things like human resources and facilities, which is sort of the bigger go-to items, if you will, after the IT category. Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thanks, guys. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats on the quarter as well. Mike, you alluded to in the last quarter Q2 got off to a very strong start. I'm wondering if you could talk about the linearity in the quarter, certainly as deals get larger and as cross-sell increases, is it becoming more back-end loaded? And maybe as a follow-up, has Q3 gotten off to a similar strong start that you saw in Q2? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : So I apologize, Matt, you cut out a little bit, so if I don't answer your question properly, I couldn't really hear the first part. I think you were asking the linearity in Q2, how was that? Yes. It was one of our fastest starts to the quarter as we had mentioned before and it's one of the beads in our subscription because the revenue came in \u2013 or the deals closed sooner so we were able to recognize more of that revenue in the current quarter. In terms of Q3, we're pleased with the start, where we are today. It's not as fast as last quarter but we weren't expecting that to be, but I would say it's slightly ahead of where we have normally been in the past in Q3. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. Frank, hopefully you can hear me on my last question here, but can you talk about the competitive landscape, be it the legacy vendors or more your emerging competitors like Salesforce.com on the platform or services side? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. The competitive dynamic is really not changing that much. I mean, we look at our \u2013 sort of our top five brands that we replace, that mix has consistently the same. Most of the sort of the energy, if you will, in the marketplace is at the low-end especially the extreme low-end all the way down on the SMB side. One of the reasons that we stood up the whole commercial sales organization alongside our enterprise sales organization is because we're going to become much stronger in that marketplace, that's also why we launched the Express products to be very, very active in that opportunity. So that's sort of where that all stands, I forgot what the other half of the question was. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Oh, maybe just more on Salesforce.com. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, SalesForce.com, obviously is a \u2013 they show up in platform situations. There aren't that many sort of head-on collisions where people go out to bid on platform opportunities. I mean, ServiceNow platform is sort of something that happens as an extension of deployment that they already have. They typically are not brand new procurements. It does happen. In those cases, it tends to be competitive with people like Salesforce, but most of the time they're really follow-on contracts and opportunities that are not competitively contested, which is actually a great advantage for us. So it isn't really a marketplace where you're out-and-out contesting platform opportunities, it's really growth from existing deployments. And that's probably something that people really need to appreciate and understand more because if you go to Garvin Group, (30:57) they always wonder why they don't get more questions about us. And the reason is the questions that have already been answered as a byproduct of people already buying into ServiceNow. They already own it. They're already using it. They're buying incremental licenses to be able to do more things with it. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot, Frank. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest. Please proceed. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : Great. Thank you very much and good afternoon. If I look at the first half, you guys have either hit or exceeded the high end of your revenue range. So as you guide for the remainder of the year, what keeps you from increasing the high-end of the range at this point? Because it's not like you guys with your subscription based model can pull things forward. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : I would just say, Rob, we're comfortable with the guidance that we gave for Q3 on the revenue side in the balance of the year and... Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : But you're not foreshadowing anything happening with the pipeline. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : No, not foreshadowing anything happening with the pipeline. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : And I'm sorry. I cut you off, Mike. You were saying something about FX? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : And you also see where FX rates are today as well. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : Sure. But they've been pretty consistent for the last couple of quarters. And then, second on the free cash flow side, if I look at the trailing 12 months you've had a free cash flow margin of roughly 15%, I think. Is there any reason to think as the business continues to grow, especially at this rate and scale why that might decline? And again, I'm looking at a 12-month basis just to kind of take out some of the one-time things that can happen with cash flow. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Long, for quite some time, our free cash flow margin will exceed our operating cash flow margin as we continued to grow here. And so, I don't see us long-term coming down below that number where it's at, because obviously we're showing margin expansion on the operating margin line on a non-GAAP basis, so there is nothing that \u2013 you wouldn't expect it to go down from there. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : Great. Thank you very much. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Brean Capital. Please proceed. Sarah Hindlian - Brean Capital LLC : Thanks for providing all of the constant currency numbers and reconciliations. I think we all appreciate that. Just a couple questions for you. Can you talk a little bit more about your sales cycles and any dynamics you've seen there that are different versus Q1? Mike, I think you recently noted that it was about a nine-month sales cycle and I'm just wondering if that's still kind of what you're seeing there. And then my second question is for Frank. And that is, I think the mid-market opportunity is really interesting. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the demand you're seeing there and where you think that could trend? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, so on the sales cycles, obviously commercial accounts can have a much shorter sales cycle. On average, though, we're still seeing nine-plus month sales cycle. Large Global 2000 accounts, you can have two-year plus sales cycles. So it does vary quite a bit by the type of customer we're selling into. And I really don't expect that initial sales cycle is going to change anytime soon, especially on large accounts because, remember, there are no Greenfield opportunities in the initial sale when we're selling into many of these people on an ITSM replacement. Now, upsells tend to happen much quicker than accounts. But once again, it varies by customer. Sarah Hindlian - Brean Capital LLC : Okay. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Frank. The only other thing I'll say about it is it's not always as neat as the sales cycle is x number of months. Sometimes transactions can just disappear because just turnover in the executive ranks, there's other priorities and they literally go dormant or even just go away for a period of time and then they get hot again. And that's just the world we live in, I mean, these are like ERP-grade type undertakings and they have a bit of an unpredictable character to them. So it's really incumbent upon us to have the volume of business to be able to absorb the ebbs and flows of the business. So it's very hard to say it is exactly this number. They are really averages and there's a huge range. We have seen very large transactions happen very, very quickly and we've seen all kinds of transactions just come wax and wane and not happen. I mean, we had one transaction close this quarter, I think I've pushed like five or six quarters in a row. That's the kind of crazy stuff that happens in our business. But the good news is they always happen. I mean, time is our friend and typically for a customer time is not their friend because things are getting older every day and more painful. On your question on the mid-market, that is the reason why we pulled through that entire sales re-org that's been talked about so much to have a full-on commercial sales organization that operates completely separately from our enterprise organization. And we're also following that up with different approaches, different types of people and different product, quite frankly, a product that is often simpler that is more aggressively priced and that really goes after a customer that looks very different than the large enterprise customer where we've been very successful. So we're really very specifically taking aim at that commercial mid-market with our products and our sales organization. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Mike, you're seeing some pretty good leverage in the business at this point. And I know you've always talked about that would come through. I'm wondering as we look the type of leverage that your guidance implies into Q3 and presumably into Q4, is there anything that we should expect that would work against that that might not let that continue for example into Q4 and into next year as we model forward? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : No, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, you won't always see that type of leverage. But you should expect to see year-over-year quarter, we will continue to show leverage in our model. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then... Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : It's just the nature of our revenues growing faster than our costs. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. And then, Frank, you sounded like you're seeing, I don't know, maybe I'd characterize it as a little bit of an inflection on the non-IT apps this quarter. And I'm wondering if that's caused you to do anything mid-year, reprioritize some of your development efforts or put incremental investment into some of those areas like the financial management app, the HR onboarding app and other areas that you may be developing apps that you haven't talked about at this point? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You know, we've been in the mode for some time to really evolve the business from being predominantly one product, one market, to multiple products, multiple markets. And we've completely reorganized ourselves on the product side to be able to execute that way. We're following through in all the other functions, sales, pre-sales, service and so on to be able to support that so that we have multiple growth engines executing simultaneously in the business. And what we highlighted this quarter is that we're seeing some really good traction within the businesses that are not in the core service management area. So that is very much part of our vision. It's very strategic to move us from the $1 billion run rate to the $4 billion run rate that Mike characterized at the Financial Analysts Day back in April on 2020 timeframe. So we have to make that transition successfully to really fully take advantage of our total addressable market opportunity. And we're seeing some evidence that that is beginning to contribute to the overall business. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you so much. I would just like to ask a little bit following on on Walter's question there about the ITOM business specifically. You've now baked in ServiceWatch. Has that helped change the trajectory of that business? Has that allowed you to have conversations you haven't had before? Maybe we could just get an update on what's going on there. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, this is Frank. ServiceWatch has been a very hot product for us. It's become the lead product for the ITOM portfolio in the sense that that's what the sales organization tees up first and likes to talk about. It attracts the attention of the entire organization. It's something that we feel everybody has to have. It's really understanding the impacts of all kinds of incidents and how it affects the services and the users that are supported by those physical assets. It is a component everybody has to have. We're having a lot of traction where the ServiceWatch, had a great quarter. We have a tremendous pipeline for that product. Very excited to have it. And it is the tip of the spear of the entire ITOM portfolio because it then drives the components right along with it, notably Discovery because Discovery and ServiceWatch go hand-in-hand. But also Event Management had a very strong quarter, Orchestration and so on. We're finding in general that selling ITOM is a very, very natural sales motion after service management. And a sales organization is really lining up worldwide in that way. So we're excited about the momentum that we're seeing in that way. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then, I'd just like to ask about your Developer Program. If we were to juxtapose your platform and development program against some of your competitors like Salesforce1, are there any key differences you might point out to us? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. One key difference that I would point out is that our platform caters to a much broader set of skill sets. We cater to professional developers and government groups sometimes refer to them as code developers. That's actually a relatively small group. Secondly, we cater to what we call low-code developers, which is a much larger group. That's been the traditional ServiceNow group. These are people that are mostly people that understand data, that know how to handle declarative constructs, but have very light scripting skills. They're not hardcore programmers. That's a group of people that ServiceNow has stood out with and sort of what put us on the map. And then, we also cater to no-code developers at all and that was people that just have to define and publish services and have absolutely no procedural skills whatsoever. So we, and by the way we outlined it at our conference that, that is really the big difference between ServiceNow and everybody else out there is that we have a very broad spectrum of developers that our platform can cater to. And that was absolutely not the case with the competition. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna. Please proceed. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great, thanks. Frank, exciting to hear about just the largest upsell ACV deal ever, just would be curious to hear a bit more about this transaction, how it came to fruition, why you won, who you displaced, the breadth of the product, adoption? Just a little bit more color on this would be great. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as we said, it's a large financial institution in Europe and just by the very scale of that institution it ended up being a very large deal. But alongside of that is we sold virtually everything that we had in that transaction as well including Performance Analytics and GRC and so on. So that was a very successful platform sell. It was the entire enchilada, if you will, which is our favorite way to sell where people really embrace the entire platform and sort of are not picking and choosing a few components or a few services. So that's really what made it big. It was a replacement of one of our large legacy people that we typically displace. What was interesting about this account was the way it wasn't just driven from the IT side which is sort of traditionally where our bigger deals come from, but we had a lot of stakeholders all the way up to the CEO office as well as the CTO, so very broad-based executive involvement in this transaction. They were looking for a big transformation on how they were doing things inside that institution. It's just nice to see transactions of the magnitude, where it's becoming that strategic for that large of an organization and we're looking for a lot more of those. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : That's great. And I guess as a follow-up, as customers are looking to adopt a platform, a breadth of modules, it would seem that there would be more of a need to help bring in best practices and more focus on ITIL frameworks and such. And how do you weigh the need to kind of have that internal consulting expertise versus leaning on partners and maybe if you could just give an update on the partner front? That'd be great. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, our general posture is we're very partner-friendly. We're not driving scale in our services business for the sake of it, because we all know it is a drag on margins. So we're basically running our services business at the pace that we feel is appropriate for the strategic need that it serves and that is we have to be able to step up. When a customer says to us, you have to lead the engagement then we have to have the ability to do it. And that requires a certain levels of mass for us to have that and also have all the skill sets that you mentioned that we can bring those to the table. And for the services organization, it's becoming a little bit more challenging because they now also need to know about project management, they need to know about ITOM, the whole operations side of the house, they need to be specialists from ServiceWatch. So we have a much greater diversity of skills now that we're asking for from our own services organization as well as from our ecosystem. But our first order of business is always we don't want to crowd out our partners. We want them to be heavily invested in our business and we always make room for our partners when we have an opportunity to do so. So it's balance, it's a mix and we will continue down that path. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I just wanted to return, Mike, to the operating margins. I think on the Q1 call, you had guided to full year non-GAAP operating margins of 5%. I might have missed it on this call, but did you update that guide? It feels like you're tracking well above that, so I'd love an update. And then secondly, related question, you materially outperformed against your operating margin guide for 2Q. Just so I understand that, was that primarily because you under hired? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Karl. So the full year guidance we gave was 6% per operating margin. In terms of the Q2 beat, there was a combination. One was we came under quite a bit in our expenses around our K15 event which we were \u2013 we managed that very well. The other thing is, hiring as you did mention. And thirdly, there were just some expenses particularly around some of our legal expenses and it was the timing of those where we were expecting we're going to come in Q2 and they pushed them to Q3. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's super helpful. And if I could just follow up on that second one, Mike or Frank, just on the hiring front. Just in terms of why it might be a little bit more back-end loaded, is that because it's a pretty tough competitive hiring market out there? And if that's the case we're certainly hearing that from plenty of other technology companies. Or is it a little bit more internal where you feel like you need to fine tune the funneling and recruiting process? Thank you. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Frank. It's mostly internal. Hiring is always hard. It's never easy. It hasn't been easy for all the time that we've been in here. We've been very good at it. We do have from time to time \u2013 we have strong quarters, we have weaker quarters. That's why we always sort of focus you back on what the annual commitment is because whatever we lose in one quarter we make it up in the next. So I would not read that much into it. It's an internal execution issue for us. We don't think the external conditions have materially changed. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Good color, thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. Please proceed. Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on renewals, just being a bit of variable with respect to the billings guidance, I wanted to ask about the effect of this greater renewal activity in the back half on maybe sales rep productivity with respect to new business. Are they having to spend more and more time on that aspect? Is there a separate team handling that? Just any color would be good. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : So there is a separate team that handles renewals, but the sales people are actively involved in those renewals, especially on our larger accounts and what I was referring to on the billings around the renewals, many times our sales people are negotiating upsells with customers and we end up doing the renewal early with those upsells that relate in billings that is very hard to forecast is what I was referring to. And that's been something that we've been dealing with for years as a company. Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it, that's helpful. And then can you maybe talk a little bit more about the traction with the Express product and the fact that you have some customers that actually in the enterprise, you get upsold or convert to the enterprise version of that product? Is that more of a strategy that you're building out and then maybe the competitive environment in that segment as well? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Frank. You know we really built Express because we felt there was sort of a section at the lower end of the marketplace where we weren't as good a fit with our enterprise product, both in terms of the feature set, user experience, the pricing, the contractual model, how automated the provisioning was, the low touch nature of the whole marketing and sales model, these people typically don't go on site for those kind of things. We got off to a very strong start with the Express product. I mean, the sequential growth is very, very fast and it's also a product that we're focusing very much on the commercial markets, probably more so than the SMB side of it. The SMB side is very low end, whereas in the commercial market, it really becomes a product where that sales organization can be much more aggressive with that product than they can be with the enterprise product. So, it's just a different model altogether in terms of the user experience, the feature set that it has, the pricing model, the contractual model, all those kinds of things. And we, we're excited to have that. The competitive dynamic is different. It's different people that show up in that space. So interestingly enough we do see people graduate from \u2013 and we highlighted that in the prepared remarks, they graduate from the Express product to the enterprise product and before we have that product we might have just never seen those people and lost them altogether. So this has really sort of grown a core capability to the overall product line that we think is super helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Frank, I think you mentioned 96 applications in the store. Can you discuss what type of functionality are they addressing? What's the common thread in those applications and how do you expect your momentum in that area to progress from here? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a lot of those applications are not brand new. They've come over from the previous shared capabilities. A lot of our partners that have been with us for a long time, a lot of them are integrations, in other words capabilities that really help ServiceNow work with other products. The traction that we're having, yes, we had about 96 of those in the system. There is another number in that order of magnitude of people that are going through various phases of certification. So it's a little bit too early to give a good characterization and we may do that in a future call and then give you a little bit more color on exactly what this is. And alternatively if you feel like getting on the site and looking at it, you're welcome to do that as well. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thanks. And, Mike, your sequential billings growth expectations of roughly flat in Q3 seem conservative as you normally experience growth in the third quarter. So was there any pull forward of deals from third quarter to second quarter or any other factors in play here that could result in below normal seasonality in third and fourth quarters? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Well, what I would say in Q2 as we mentioned our weighted average billing term was 12.2 months versus 11.7 months in the previous quarter. And as a result that was about a $10 million pickup we had because we had some multiyear billings in the quarter. And I don't \u2013 we don't forecast multiyear billings in our billings guidance. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Please proceed. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. You had mentioned that new customers are starting with larger initial transactions, I was hoping you could just give a little color on whether that's more a function of adopting a lot more users upfront versus adoption of some of the emerging products you had mentioned? Thank you. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the \u2013 this is Frank \u2013 we're selling broader and higher these days than we ever have. It was a, sort of a key thrust for us coming in 2015 to not sell sort of tactically in narrow categories, but really position the company broadly and widely and that does drive bigger transactions upfront. So this is what we expect to see happen, it doesn't always happen that way. We talked about our largest upsell project we've ever seen, that was an upsell that was not an initial deal. So it's happened many times that we may have an ACV contract with somebody for a couple hundred thousand and then we have an upsell that's worth millions. And it doesn't really matter all that much, whether we land with a small transaction first and do a much bigger transaction afterwards because what we really look at is and what we really track and measure is really how many customers would we have in that ACV range. And I think we said we have 168 customers now that are over $1 million in ACV. That's really what matters. How they got there and how many transactions is really not as important because we will campaign the customer for the entire product line regardless of whether they get started with us small or whether they sort of bite off the whole thing upfront. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thank you. I was curious to drill into the ACV of $6 million in the financial services sector. So when you look at companies like Salesforce.com that have been through your phase, they are a comparable size, I think a little bit larger, they signed a big deal with HP, some $10 million, $15 million in ACV per year or something like that. Could this be the beginning of a turn in the way big deals are done by ServiceNow? In other words, is this a one-off or do you see validation for what could be building in the pipeline for more of these mega deals? And my second follow-up was, if you were to look at a new ACV, that is (56:50) the renewal and look at new ACVs, was there a change in the composition of new ACVs by the core ITSM versus the non-core? Thank you. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of the mega, this is Frank, I always take the position that, if I can do one, I can do more than one, if not hundreds. And I'm not just saying that in regards to this particular transaction. But we saw an almost $2 million transaction with our GRC product. If we can do one, we can do more. The same thing on the ITOM side with ServiceWatch. If we do a handful, we can do a lot more. It's really proving to yourself that you can do it and then we will scale it broadly and deeply. So the answer generally to your question is yes. We can do it once and we believe that that becomes the evidence that we can do it many, many, many more times. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : As a follow up to your other part of your question, initial deals still tend to have a bigger service management component and the follow-on deals tend to be more skewed towards products outside of service management. That doesn't surprise us because our land-and-expand strategy all along has been we sell into IT, it's generally an ITSM replacement. We are starting to do more beyond that in initial deals. But, remember, because we have so many old customers that started with ITSM, a big portion of upsells tends to be outside of service management. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I see. Then when you look at the upsells specifically, is there a change in the composition of the new products versus existing ITSM add-on? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : I guess that's looks like a derivative question. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I would generally say yes and I will add to that. What Mike's saying is absolutely correct. That has been our historical go-to-market motion. It still very much dominates in how we do things. But as we fully transition to a multi-product, multi-market model, I would not be surprised to see us lead with transactions that are not service management at all. That is going to happen. And we've already seen we've done human resources deals, for example, in accounts where we've done absolutely nothing on the IT side. And that's going to happen as a byproduct of how we're organized and multiple prongs that we have going into our sales campaigns. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sounds very exciting. Thank you. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Please proceed. Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Yeah, two quick questions here. On the Express customers who migrated to the enterprise, what features or capabilities were they looking for? And I know it's a small sample size. And how did that affect their ACV? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, this is Frank. It affects their ACV immediately. That's a much bigger bill. The features that make them graduate, usually it has to do with client or service-side scripting and the ability to really take advantage of the platform. As you recall, Express was very much designed as a product that can deploy in hours and days, not weeks and months. And we do that because there's really nothing to do other than loading in your users and their credentials and you just hit the button and you go. All the processes are predefined. That's the concept behind Express. That's why it's called Express. When customers get into that, then they all of a sudden are starting to develop all kinds of requirements that don't fit that highly standardized model. Now we're going into the enterprise model, it costs more money and it's a much more powerful product. That's typically what happens. People often think going into the process that that product will suit their needs very, very well. And then they get into the process and they develop requirements that they did not originally envision. So, it's not a bait and switch. It's just that as people learn what it is that they really want to do, sometimes that triggers an upgrade. And the great thing about the way the product is architected is it's a push-button upgrade. So we can take people's instances from Express to enterprise in a very, very simple, straightforward manner. So there is no painful conversion migration associated with that process. Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. And can you give us maybe like a percentage on the ACV increase? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Well, generally our minimum deal on the enterprise is $42,000 a year. The average ACV on Express is somewhere between $10,000 to $15,000. So you can see the uplift. Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just one, in the past you guys used to give a cohort analysis on the number of apps that were used on the platform. I think you were mentioning that earlier, Frank. Do you guys still track that and can you share it with us? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do track that. I don't have the latest and greatest data on me. But I think we said the average is about 6.5 apps right now. 85% of our customers have on average 6.5 apps on the platform. We will update that again, that data. We look at that in every six month on a cohort basis to see how that is progressing. Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Rizzuto with SunTrust. Please proceed. John Christopher Rizzuto - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. I might ask you a question about platform-as-a-service. And not yours in particular, but the movement toward. It's been very slow for enterprise adoption, but that seems to be accelerating. So as that changes, the face of the IT industry changes. So I'm really looking for two indications. A, if you think it's going to make a change, good, bad or indifferent to your business? And then, B, has anything happened as more enterprises, perhaps even your own customers starting to go toward the Cloud with their own development needs and their own IT needs? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, this is Frank. I find that delineation between platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service is just too stark a contrast because the reality is that people would love to have standard services that they don't have to build because it's obviously a lot quicker and easier to take things off the shelf. If you can figure modify for your needs and you go, we typically see that people get started with standard services and then as they learn how things work and they develop new requirements, they start to add custom services where they are now using the platform as a platform and they add that it, so it's a very fluid mix of using platform and standard services. That to us is typical. It is not typical to see pure platform deals where people are not using any standard services and everything is from scratch. We have those customers. They exist, but that is not the main mode of our business. The main mode of our business is very, very much mixed use between standard and custom. John Christopher Rizzuto - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. But. Frank, what I was asking about was if I \u2013 if say Proctor & Gamble, one of your customers, starts to do some of its own custom application on Microsoft's Azure, certainly the service desk component, different components of the IT that it may have as a customer of yours, it can still use. I'm just wondering if that's a catalyst as some of your existing customers or potential customers go to another past service, again migrating to cloud adoption more broadly, how that might have an affect or you don't think it may, or it might not? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, our used cases on the platform are much more associated with the service model in general. So we sort of have not ventured into the very broad world of custom application development where sort of any type of project can be attempted. I mean that is a totally different market. So our platform applications are always downstream from where we already are with the domains that we're serving, okay. So we're not a general purpose infrastructure as a service capability like an Azure or Amazon Web Services where it's the infrastructure and then some ancillary services to help people along. So our platform orientation is very different from those kind of offerings. John Christopher Rizzuto - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no more questions in the queue. I will now turn the call back to you, Michael, for any closing remarks. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the investors Section of our website. Thank you for joining us today.

Landing new logos, renewing contracts and upselling existing customers continues to be our formula for growth. We now have 605 Global 2000 customers, a net increase of 39 during the quarter. New Global 2000 logos include Humana, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Express Scripts and The Dow Chemical Company. Additionally, our upsell rate was 37% and our renewal rate was 98%. There are three observations to the quarter worthy of note. First, the CIOs increasingly view ServiceNow as an enterprise platform, not a portfolio of point products. We've been successful providing customers a single platform solution with many options to help them transform a variety of service domains. Many of those services are within the realm of enterprise IT but the scope has no limits and can be internal or exertional to the enterprise. We gauge our progress by tracking revenue per customer, not revenue per product. In the third quarter, our ACV per Global 2000 customer was 816,000, a 28% increase over last. We now have 206 customers with more than 1 million in ACV, a 62% increase over last year and on average our customers increase their initial ACV by more than 50% every year. While this trend of growing dollars per customer is being driving by success across the entire ServiceNow platform, we were pleased to see strong contribution during the quarter from our ITOM which represented 14% of our net new ACV and grew 170% year-over-year and from Performance Analytics which represented 5% of our net new ACV and grew 179% year-over-year. Second, our partner ecosystem is becoming a substantial vector of growth for our business. We believe CSC's acquisition Fruition Partners and Accenture's acquisition of Cloud Sherpas during the quarter will fuel service transformations across a much broader range of businesses around the world. In addition to global system integrators, managed service providers are increasingly choosing ServiceNow to replace legacy solutions for their customers. Among them, Dell substantially stepped up its commitment to the ServiceNow platform during the quarter. ACV for managed service providers grew 84% year-over-year and now represents approximately 10% of our total our ACV. Finally, Q3 was our strongest federal government quarter-to-date. We signed 15 new federal partners and closed 58 deals representing 9% of our net new ACV this quarter compared to 39 deals representing 6% of net new ACV last year. Additionally, net new ACV from federal increased 86% year-over-year. We were awarded contracts with the U.S. Army, The Air Force, Homeland Security, Veteran Affairs and The Department of Justice. We also extended our relationship with existing customers including agencies within the Intelligence Community, the State Department, Health and Human Services and the Treasury Department. This quarter also marks the company punching through the $1 billion revenue run rate and ServiceNow is increasingly well positioned to achieve the long-term objectives we outlined at our Financial Analysts Day in April this year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Frank. During today's call, we will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q4 and full year 2015. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investor.servicenow.com. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $261 million, increasing 46% year-over-year and 55% in constant currency, a negative impact of $16 million. Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells and renewals were 31.6 months, 27.8 months and 22.9 months respectively. Total revenues based on geography were $181 million in North America, $62 million in EMEA and $18 million in Asia-Pacific and Other, representing 69%, 24% and 7% of total revenues respectively. Our calculated billings were $286 million in the quarter increasing 38% year-over-year and 46% in constant currency, a negative impact of $16 million. Our weighted average subscription billings term was 11.8 months for the third quarter compared to 11.9 months in the prior year or a negative impact of $3 million year-over-year and compared to 12.2 months in the prior quarter or a negative impact of $9 million sequentially. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 83% compared to 79% in the prior year. Professional services and other gross margin was 21% compared to 13% in the prior year. Overall gross margin was 74% compared to 69% in the prior year. Operating margin was 15% compared to 6% in the prior year. We ended the quarter with 3,402 employees, a net increase of 215 from the prior quarter. For full year 2015, we expect to add approximately 825 net new employees. Net income for the third quarter was $25 million or $0.16 per basic and $0.15 per diluted share compared to a net income of $6 million or $0.04 per basic and $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 157 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 169 million. During the third quarter, we generated $63 million in cash flow from operation and we used $21 million for capital expenditures resulting in $42 million in free cash flow. This compares to $7 million of free cash flow in the prior year. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments. Let's turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of Q3. For the fourth quarter 2015, we expect total revenues between $277 million and $282 million, representing year-over-year growth between 40% and 42% and between 44% and 47% in constant currency, a negative impact of $9 million. We expect subscription revenues between $239 million and $243 million and professional services and other revenues between $38 million and $39 million. We expect billings between $370 million and $375 million representing year-over-year growth between 35% and 37% and between 39% and 41% in constant currency, a negative impact of $12 million. We expect subscription gross margin of approximately 82%, professional services and other gross margin of approximately 15% and overall gross margin of approximately 73%. We expect an operating margin of 9% and free cash flow of approximately $60 million. Based on Q4 guidance, the implied full year 2015 guidance for total revenue is approximately $1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 47% and approximately 55% in constant currency, a negative impact of $56 million. The implied full year 2015 guidance for billings is approximately $1.2 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 41% and 49% in constant currency, a negative impact of $71 million. The implied full year 2015 guidance for operating margin and free cash flow is approximately 9% and $207 million respectively. We expect to end the year with approximately $180 million fully diluted gross shares outstanding which includes all basic shares, stock options and RSUs outstanding before applying the treasury stock method. As a final reminder, we've included a high-level reconciliation of constant currency for Q3 results and guidance in the appendix of our quarterly investor's deck posted at investors.servicenow.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Standby for your first question, which comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open, Walter, please go ahead. You may be on mute. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Please go ahead, Brent. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Mike, there was just some open questions on the billings this quarter and the deceleration from Q2, I'm just curious if you could comment and I know you don't give out the backlog, but I know billings only paints a smaller picture of the overall momentum of the company, but if you could comment, that would be great. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Well, if you're looking at from Q2 to Q3, as a reminder, Q2 was abnormally high because of the 12.2 months weighted average billings which we disclosed last quarter and we said that's not normal. We're normally running in the 11.7 months to 11.9 months, we're at 11.8 months this quarter and as a result that actually cost us about $9 million in this quarter billings. However, we were expecting that to come down and hence why we are just slightly ahead of where we guided our billings. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up on operating margins, you exceeded expectations pretty handily this quarter, 15% operating margin yet you're bringing the margin guide down for Q4. Just may be walk through why such overage this quarter and why it will contract by 600 basis points in Q4? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So this quarter a lot of it was because of the timing of expenses and a lot of our hiring was backend loaded in the quarter. What's really driving though the Q4 coming down is more so as many people know we're moving our head office. There is a provision in our Q4 guidance where we still have yet to sublease our space here and the move cost us about $10 million in one-time cost associated with moving out of our facility here to our new facility that's running through our forecast. On top of that we're also running our NOW Forums in Europe in Q4 as well as in Asia Pacific and our federal NOW Forum which are kind of mini-knowledge conferences where there is about $2 million in expenses running through that as well. The new lease and some other leases we have that are full quarters next quarter that are partially came on this quarter and will come on next quarter into the future. Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, guys for taking the question. I just want to ask a little bit about professional services. It looks like as you are ramping up sort of the partner ecosystem, the growth that we're seeing on the professional services line seems to be coming down and it definitely seems true in Q4 as well. Is this a concerted effort on your part to push out more professional services to the partners and then maybe sort of take out some of that off the income statement for you guys? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, this is Frank. It is a concerted effort and we've talked about this consistently over the years that we were not driving our professional services revenue to big numbers. Obviously professional services is always a drag on the margin profile on the overall business and it really exists as a strategic resource and we're sizing it to where it needs to be for us to be able to deliver on our core mission. The good news is that our partner ecosystem which we have very aggressively fostered over the years has grown enormously both in size as well as in capability. There were a bunch of inflection points during the quarter and we highlighted that during the prepared remarks where CSC made a big acquisition in the space. Accenture made a big acquisition in the space. So a lot of our big GSI partners are really putting their money where their mouth is. They are doubling and tripling down our business. That's very, very positive for ServiceNow, because we can sort of retreat from the primary pole position, if you will, in terms of delivering services and really yield to our partners. It doesn't mean we're going to be exiting the business. It just means that in relative terms that contribution will be coming down gradually. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Congrats on the quarter. Frank, actually just a follow-up on your point earlier about the acquisition we've seen in some of your bigger GSI \u2013 or some of your bigger partners. Longer term clearly having cloud service and Fruition on bigger platform would seem to be a huge benefit from you guys. I guess is there any concern as they get integrated that some of the deals that they might have been working on get caught up or delayed. I think the longer term benefit clearly outstrips any sort of near-term noise. But I was just kind of curious about how you think about that in the near term and if that impacts your, I guess your near-term guidance at all? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think so. We really have no reason to believe that. I think our market has really very positively embraced that news. We're very happy with these very large integrators stepping up the way they are. This is really good for our customer base. We highlighted the fact that we have an enormous presence in Global 2000 accounts and of course that's where Accenture and CSC and all the others, that's where they are. So this increases the confidence of our customers to really invest more broadly, more deeply in the ServiceNow platform because the ecosystem just growing in size and prominence because this is all good. Kirk Materne - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay. And just if I could ask a quick follow up for Mike. Just on cash flow obviously incredibly strong cash flow this quarter, I assume some of that just drops down from the margin outperformance. As we think out to 2016, I guess how should we be thinking about cash flow maybe relative to revenue growth next year? I guess does that kind of come back into line with revenue growth, or are they any things, I guess we should contemplate as we're building out our models on cash flow for next year? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : I expect that 2016 cash flow will outpace our revenue growth for next year and in January we will give you formal guidance around what we're seeing cash flow for 2016. Kirk Materne - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks guys for taking my questions. I wanted to ask another one on the SI movement this quarter. Certainly we like to see that, the mix shift here. Frank, can you talk about the compositions of some of these wins coming from the platform? Do they look more like your classic ITSM or are they more HR or finance just sort of \u2013 what are some of the composition of those deals look like? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Are you asking me about platform deals specifically what they look like? Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Well, I guess, maybe more specifically what like Cloud Sherpas or the Fruition, what is the mix of those deals look like, I would assume it would look more like HR, more like sort of non-core ITSM deals, but just wanted to get a confirmation of that. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Those guys are definitely core ITSM. They've really sort of grown up in their business, whether it's \u2013 Cloud Sherpas, obviously, they got into the ServiceNow business through an acquisition as well of one of our long-term partners. And these are all folks that have been in the service management business with ServiceNow going all the way back to the mid-2000. So they're very much meat-and-potatoes type of partners in the core business. It's really the Accentures of the world that are sort of branching out into the higher levels of process design, business process optimization things that are not core service management type applications. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. And then, maybe just a quick one for Mike, maybe sort of a follow-on to the services offloading again here, is there a way to quantify the impact to your Q4 billings guide if you were to not be offloading that revenue component? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Geez. Well, first of all, professional services is not that big a component of our overall billings. As you can see, last quarter, we're guiding $38 million to $39 million professional services. And pretty much what the billings \u2013 what the revenue is, that's equal to the billings because everything is done on a time and material basis in general. So I think from where consensus is for the full year, we're taking down our PS revenue, but we're increasing our subscription revenue relative to consensus. And I think subscription is going up at the top end of the range by close to $7 million and PS is coming down about $2 million to $3 million, and so as a result you could say that $2 million to $3 million of our billings is coming out of professional services. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Please go ahead, Michael. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys, a couple of quick questions. First off, Mike, are we now at a point where that 11.9 months does that look stable for the future or should we see any change? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : You are always going to see some variability, but on average we've running at around 11.7 months to 11.9 months is what our weighted average billings. I am not going to say we're never going to be above or below that, but in general we should be there. As we get bigger as a company, you should see less variability, but there could one day be a very large customer that wants to prepay multiple years in advance that will skew that and, unfortunately, we don't have much visibility hence why every quarter we disclose what our weighted average billings are and we normalize for that. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Two other quick ones. One, it looks like you did upside on the subscription gross margin and also it looks like your head count target \u2013 head count add target might be a little lower than it was, can you just address that? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We've taken down part of our numbers for hiring, most of it is coming out of our support and cloud infrastructure as well as our G&A functions. Our sales and marketing and R&D are pretty much the same from where they were at the beginning of the year. Professional services is one from the beginning, as we've talked about before, that we've taken quite a bit out of that head count add, but that matches with what we're taking down our PS because we want our partners to be doing more of the PS work so. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And the gross margin (22:33) subscription? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : ....pretty much. Sorry, what was that? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I didn't mean to interrupt you, Mike, sorry. But I was just going to ask on the upside on the subscription gross margin? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : That's really timing on certain assets within our data center starting to depreciate as well as we're starting to see a little bit more scale in our data center and timing with some of those head count starts. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Brean Capital. Please go ahead. Sarah Hindlian - Brean Capital LLC : Thank you for taking my question, guys, and congratulations on the quarter. I think looking through the numbers, that's pretty clear there is a nice mix shift away from professional services, which looks like we didn't take full account for in our numbers, but it's certainly good thing. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the ITOM business, which I heard you comment has grown to 14% of new billings. What are you guys seeing there and how is that shaping up? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Frank, Sarah. We've had a pretty good focus on the ITOM business really since the beginning of the year since we organized our product organization and got a lot more dedicated focus in terms of billing and supporting and marketing those products, so we've gotten a lot more deliberate in terms of our outbound go-to-market motion with these products. And seeing the last of couple of quarters as a percentage of the mix, these things are moving in leaps and bounds. ITOM is a very strategic component of our business because operations management and service management shared the underlying CMDB, the asset repository, they're sort of like two sides of a coin. This is absolutely imperative for us that we are present and that we compete in that business and we're just pleased that we're making the kind of headway that we are. It's exactly the same buyers, the same budgets. So it is extremely compatible with the business that we were already in. It's sort of, if you will, the closest cousin of our core service management business is what the ITOM business is. And the moving parts there are discovery, orchestration. Obviously, the service mapping technology that we acquired last year are all in the mix. We've created ITOM portfolios and a lot of our customers are sort of consuming the whole portfolio now rather than just some of the individual component. So we're looking to put more fuel in the fire in this business and our sales organization is pretty charged up about having these products to sell. Sarah Hindlian - Brean Capital LLC : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please go ahead. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks. Actually a follow-up there on the ITOM question. I'm wondering given your success, Frank, so far this year and, I guess, late last year to this year, with those ITOM products, does it make you look at potentially expanding the product line more aggressively in ITOM into sort of what we considered in the past some of the manager managers event management APM type areas that you are not in today. And then I just had a follow-up for Mike. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Walter, we are an event management because our acquisition of Neebula last year actually having an event management component that we actually combined with our own capabilities. And our next major software release, which is now imminent, has a full blown event manager in it and we already recorded very substantial ACV in Q3 to the event management category, so we're in it. But to answer your question more specifically, absolutely we are evaluating assets continually in terms of things that we want to build, things that we want buy. As you know, we are an acquirer of assets, but we're not ultra aggressive because we have hard time convincing ourselves that we want to own something. But when we do, we move and I think so far our track record on buying assets and converting them to yield has been quite good. But this is a focus area and we see opportunity, we will absolutely be pursuing it. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then, Mike, just I'm not sure how much you really talked about this, but from a Q1 seasonality perspective, back in 2014, you had a really strong Q1 with billings actually up sequentially and then last year or this year you sort of had more of a normal kind of company getting bigger seasonality in there. I'm wondering if you could help us just sort of think about Q1 the right way and just so we're not surprised in three months as you guide? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Q4 to Q1 historically has been pretty \u2013 you'd expect it to almost be flat, don't expect it to go up. It's really Q4 every quarter when you look at it historically that has the big jump. Remember, a lot of the deals we sign in Q4 have January 1 start date and hence that becomes part of our January 1 billing and historically there is a lot of backlog that gets built in January as well, too, which impacts our Q1 billings. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So flattish more than down is what you're saying? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. And you'll get more detailed guidance in January. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Mike. Just wanted to ask you a question about the fourth quarter billings guide at 39% to 41% constant currency. It assumes more moderate growth. I think we understand the 3Q just given the tough compare and that $9 million hit. But on 4Q, it's a slower growth, yet it feels like the momentum of the business is pretty solid. So I'm wondering if you could help reconcile that and let us know whether the Geneva release, assuming it's coming in 4Q, has any impact at all on your guide? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : The Geneva release has no impact on our billings at all. And we are guiding $370 million to $375 million in billings, which is up from the $286 million that we did just right now. So we think that is a reasonable guidance. I really don't have anything else to add to that. The consensus right now is at $370 million for this quarter for Q4. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Frank, can you share some success stories of outside of IT where you had the most success and how is your pipeline looking for that? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I didn't catch that. Tell me again. Success stories in regards to what? Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Outside of IT, in HR? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, outside of IT. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. And areas where you're having the most success and how is your pipeline looking for those types of implementations? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So one of the things to remember and we keep reminding people sort of every quarter of this notion, right? We don't manage our business sort of IT/non-IT because most of the time we don't even know when people are inside of IT or outside of IT. There are application areas that cross the boundaries of IT, for example, purchase requisitioning apps involve IT because they process IT purchase requisitions, they can also relate to non-IT. The same thing is true with project management. Those work flows are IT and non-IT. So, we don't manage the business that way. These days we talk about service management and the contacts will indicate whether that service management for IT that are known as ITSM or whether it's service management for customer service, whether it's service management for human resources or any other sort of global service domain that you find in the enterprise. It is becoming much more accepted in large institutions, large enterprises to sort of view service management in the context of global business services. Lot of big companies now have global business service executives that are sort of peers of the CIO, sometimes the CIO is the head of global business services. So they are addressing the service domain in a much more global manner versus having systems for IT, systems for HR and so on. So we've come a long way in the last four years and really sort of move into market in terms of how they have to think about service management. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're really not so much trying to measure every single variety of service management. We're really looking at what is the overall investment that customers have in service. Now that really indicates what their degree of commitment to our platform is and it varies quite a lot where it's coming from because some people are very heavy on the ITOM site. We have customers that start out with us in HR and end up on the IT site much later on. We had one customer this quarter who bought one of our partner's application solutions that was built on our platform that actually derived a platform deal for us, but then downstream it's going to yield opportunities for IT. So our business arrives in many forms and flavors and sorry for your long answer, but I just don't have an answer to your question because that's not the way we think about the business not the way we manage and report it to ourselves. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: No, thanks. That was helpful. Frank and I'm sorry Mike I know you're not talking about 2016 yet, but can you give some qualitative color on how we should think about your need for investments versus margin expansion? You have a 2020 target of 30% margin. How should we expect the trajectory of your margin from the current level? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : So, at a very high level, and we'll give more detailed guidance later on. As we mentioned, we expect about a 9% operating margin this year and we expect that to be kind of in the \u2013 at a high level right now, somewhere in the 11% to 14% margin, 13% margin. We're still planning our 2016 investments right now. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Pacific Securities. Please go ahead. Ben McFadden - Pacific Crest Securities : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. This is actually Ben McFadden on for Rob. I wanted to start with just a question on kind of what you're seeing with the broad macro environment? Was there any, I mean I know you guys are still seeing healthy growth, but was there any verticals or deals where you saw slippage in deals in the quarter? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Frank. Ben, one area that immediately jumps out and I've been in the recent months to Houston, Calgary. The oil patch is brutal. It has come to in a very abrupt halt and basically businesses that are dependent on those sectors are hurting in a huge way. So we felt that as well as is everybody else. It doesn't matter what you do wherever you are. You are not going to escape that trend. So that one is sort of first and foremost. We don't have too much sort of macroeconomic overhang. Sometimes it's even hard for us to sort of know whether something is macro or micro or secular or whatever it is and we don't have too many excuses because I think we have the ability to drive our business sort of regardless of what's going on in the macro because we're driving transformations and optimizations that people are going to need no matter what's going on out there. Ben McFadden - Pacific Crest Securities : So when we think of linearity in the quarter, was it pretty linear or was it \u2013 or did you see a shift as far as how that was weighted? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : We thought that it was very similar to most quarters. Remember, as I've said many times at conferences, this is no different than any other typical enterprise software company. There is majority of businesses in month three of any quarter and there is a lot of business that's booked in the last two weeks of the quarter. And we continue to see that this quarter like we've done every quarter. Ben McFadden - Pacific Crest Securities : Sure. I just wanted to follow-up real quick with just \u2013 any metrics that you can give us as far as kind of what you're seeing with CreateNow and the ServiceNow store? Just something, any metrics you can provide as far as what you're seeing with developer traction there would be great. Thanks. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. This is Frank. I think we've given metrics in the past on our cohort analysis. About 85% of our customers have custom applications build. In average they're about, I think it's about six to seven apps now that they have. So that's still something that continues to move up into the right. In terms of our store, we see the amount of content in terms of number of entrees growing sequentially in the 20% to 25% range. Those are some things that sort of come to mind that gives you some character to that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Joanna Kamien - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, it's actually Joanna Kamien on for Phil. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment at all on the customer uptake of Discovery and Orchestration and if you could give any feedback from customers? Thanks. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. This is Frank. It's been very good. Certainly it's helped that we really have combined Discovery with our service mapping technology, which has made that a more integral solution. That's made actually most products more marketable. Orchestration is something where we have built some out of the box applications for in terms of provisioning. That's actually made that easier to sell and more marketable. They are a pretty good size component of the overall ITOM component. And so it's going well and we're pushing on that. They're foundational to the ITOM suite. Joanna Kamien - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great and congrats on the quarter. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi, thank you very much. I am trying to get a better handle on the guidance. Mike, I appreciate the fact that contract duration came down to 11.8, it was 11.8 months Q4 of last year. So I'm assuming you're using 11.8 months for your Q4 forecast and contract duration is not going to hurt you and I'm looking at ACV for your G2K, it's been steadily going up 10% sequentially, so no problem there. And I'm looking at your customers paying more than $1 million in ACV and the average ACV per customer paying you more than $1 million is up from $2 million to $2.1 million and you added more new customers paying $1 million in ACV this quarter than you did in Q2 or in Q1 for the matter (38:45) in the past four quarters, this is the record high. So help us understand why you're guiding to report a deceleration in billings terms? Are you just assuming some conservatism which I completely respect given that we're living in uncertain times, but otherwise outside of that had a question for Frank, if you get the time to get through my questions on the financial side? Thank you very much. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : So, first of all, we're not guiding to a deceleration in billings term because we're still assuming that we're going to be somewhere in that 11.7 months to 11.9 months weighted average billing term that's not changing. In the billings that we are giving guidance for, we think is a reasonable amount of $370 million to $375 million. As we said last quarter, we expect that the number to be in the $1.2 billion for the full year. When you apply that total we just did, I think it comes in around $1.207 billion is what our full year billings guidance is and we'll see December 31 what our actual billings was. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it. And Mike, did you, did I catch you right that we said from Q4 to Q1 you think billings will be flat and not down just to clarify Walter's question? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Right now based upon where we are looking, without me giving full guidance, because once again it depends a lot on the terms of what we sign right now I expect that Q1 will be roughly equal to what Q4 is and you saw that last year where it's slightly up actually last year. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it. Question for you, Frank. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Adjusting for FX. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yeah. I got it. ITOM is significant, fantastic statistics here. Are you going to have a specialist sales force and go-to-market changes next year? That's it for me. Thank you. Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have established a sales team with and it's essentially an overlay function to have. We have hired experts for not just for ITOM but for whole series of product lines. We also do it for Performance Analytics; we do it for human resources; we have it around financial management and DRC. So, we have embarked on really overlaying our sales force with sales experts in all these categories for some time now, which is one of the reasons why we are having really, really strong traction in a lot of these emerging product areas is because of the focus that we have had on it and we're having really good success cross-selling, upselling these products right behind our core platform. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you very much. Congrats. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell from JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Just one quick question. Obviously the 29 new Global 2000 customers is really impressive and that's even more than what you added in your last Q4. My question has to do with the ACV per G2K customer. It looks like it was up 3% sequentially and on a sequential basis that's lower than it traditionally is. Now, I was just wondering what drove that? Is that a function of just the sheer amount of customers you added or does that have to do with the mix of what was sought or was it something else? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : It's a number of things, but one of the things is the \u2013 if you look at the average ACV for most \u2013 net 29 Global 2000, it was relatively low amount relative to what our average Global 2000 is. It was somewhere in the mid 250,000. We seeded a lot of Global 2000 accounts. There were a couple of big ones in there but what I will say is then we had a couple deals where we're stepping in as an example. We have one Global 2000 we landed now which was well below our average but that they have a contractual upsell of $4.5 million on December 31. So we did some of those deals that aren't reflected now that you'll see next quarter. So I'm not concerned about the long-term 4% sequential growth, we need to see out of our Global 2000. As a reminder, we did 7% last quarter. And so you will see some variability but long term we think that 4% is very reasonable. And if you look at our cohort slide that is our investor deck you can continue to see that our customers that we brought in in 2014, we've already grown the ACV and those on average by 50%. So, we still have another quarter to go of upsells to those. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. This is Jason Velkavrh on for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you would talk about the Fuji release, what's customer response been to that and how actively is that being adopted versus past releases? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's Frank here. Fuji is already sort of ancient (43:55) history for us because we're literally on the eve now of our Geneva release. So we're about ready to start upgrading our internal systems all those kind of stuff. So Fuji has been out there and people have moved very aggressively towards it because the content has been very compelling. It's been a very good release. We expect the same thing out of Geneva. We have even higher hopes for because there is just a lot of reasons for people to want to move to Geneva. Because our organization has grown so much, I mean, there is ever more and more compelling content in these releases, which keeps our customers moving from one to the other, so it's all been good. Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. And then just one follow-up, to dig into ITOM a bit more, just in general, your senior customers, your IT op customers been able to reduce head count in the wake of adoption of your ITOM products? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't have any real authoritative evidence to say yes/no anecdotally. Sure, we hear about that but a lot of it has to do what organizations really trying to lighten up and modernize this kind of portfolio of tools. I think as many of you know, the tools in the ITOM space are just like they used to be on the service management side, they're quite old. They date back to the 1980s and the 1990s. They're often very expensive; they're really not well suited for modern platforms and architectures. So this is often driven by organizations that really want to go through tool consolidations, tool modernizations. And the big advantage that we have is the single platform orientation and a complete integration with the CMDB. It's an extremely compelling way of going about modernizing this portfolio of capabilities. So that's really what it's about it. People are saving money on the software side and obviously they are after automation in the process as well and so lightening up on staffing along the way. Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Stephens PH (sic) [Stephens, Inc]. Please go ahead. Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys thank you for taking my question. Maybe the first one, can you guys talk about the number of new seven figure deals and also mention if there were any elephant-size deals in the quarter? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, we did. I think we did nine deals that were north of $1 million, three were new customers, six were upsells and there were no elephant deals in the quarter, defining, what's \u2013 I am assuming what you mean by elephant is more than $3 million in net new ACV. There were none of those in the quarter. Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And then are you seeing any change in the cadence that you are closing some of your larger deals or upsells and maybe also just talk about sales rep productivity and where hiring came in versus your expectations for sales reps? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : So, in terms of the cadence of closing deals as we said before, this is a very long sales cycle. This is a 9-plus month sale cycle for large deals. I haven't really seen any change there since the time I have been with the company. In terms of productivity, we saw pretty even productivity in the Americas and Asia Pacific. It was down quarter-over- quarter in EMEA, but remember, Q2 was very high in EMEA unusually high because we had one deal in particular that was very large that skewed that, nothing that gives us any concern this quarter. The pipeline looks good and... Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Staffing. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : And staffing, we don't talk about sales reps themselves. We're a few head count behind in our sales and marketing organization but nothing that has us concerned there. Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Thank you, guys, for taking my questions. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks. You guys had 35% growth in new customer wins. It looks like that's the highest in three years and, obviously, you had a strong uptick in Global 2000 as well. Could you talk about the new coverage model, how that's playing into driving kind of broader new customer strength and what the key ingredients in the segmentation strategy are right now? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Frank. I don't have too much to add to this. I mean, you remember that the first of the year, we split our Americas organization up in commercial and enterprise, which I think people are still trying to get over. But that actually was a very good thing for us to do because we've had \u2013 we made really good progress in the commercial market that's trending really, really well. But it has also made our enterprise organization a lot more focused at the same time. So a lot of the progress that you're seeing that we're making is because our deployment model is just much more precise, much more fine grind, and I actually think we have quite a bit of room up in 2016 in really optimizing the deployment model. How we're taking resources and where we're putting them in is really one of the key things that drives growth and productivity in our organization. So I think we have better runway there to see more benefit. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : That's great. And then, Mike, what's the channel contribution right now and do you have any longer-term targets for indirect? Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : So, first of all, very little of our business goes directly through the channel, it's under 15% of our business goes through the channel. However, the channel does heavily influence our deals. The problem is it's hard to track to what extent they influence and we definitely do not have any target for what amount of our business needs to go through the channel, I don't think it's going to go \u2013 I think it will be for quite some time below 20%. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Frank, I was wondering if you look at the remaining Global 2000 that you don't count as customers today, what percent of them do you think are using MSPs? And then just how important are some of these acquisitions like CSC and the Dell announcement and Accenture in terms of further penetrating that opportunity? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's not the MSPs, that's the GSIs, it's probably what you mean, they are Global System Integrators, they're super important. The Accentures and KPMGs and EY, Deloitte are enormous influencers of these kind of transactions, so that's why, what's going on in their part of the business is very, very good for us. So we still have a long ways to go. We have 30%, but there is a ton of them out there. The saturation now we have and the ones where we have footprint is still long ways in terms of being usurped as business. So the GSIs are very, very important business. I can't overstate the importance of it in the Global 2000 segment of our business. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. But, I guess, again like CSC for example a big MSP provider, they acquired Fruition and it sounds like they have aspirations not going into all of these EMC accounts and ripping that out and putting in service. I am wondering like how much of that Global 2000 that's not today a customer are using outsourced ITSM and what do you think some of these deals and the delta (52:08) does for you to penetrate that opportunity? Frank Slootman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't think they are using outsourced, that's what I meant to say they are not MSPs, they are not using so much outsourced ITSM, but they happen to own their own systems, but they use the GSIs to do process design and do the general consulting and implementation around it. So when it comes time to change systems that have been sitting there for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, having a very trusted Global System Integrator in the account is very important, to give the account the confidence to go on that journey. It's not easy to turn off systems that have been around for that long and replace them. These are knifepoint transition. They have to turn one off, turn another one on, and having a GSI in the account sort of handhold the account through it, is a big part of making this business happen. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : You are correct, Justin, and that the number of CSC have a very big MSP practice but they also have a very big GSI practice as well, but most of the Global 2000 use the GSIs. There are many Global 2000 who use the MSPs, but the vast majority are running around systems they may augment their staff with some of the GSIs, but it's the Global 2000 who are making the purchase decisions not the MSP for them. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then just quickly on the pipeline. If you look at it today, just curious what the mix of ITSM versus non-ITSM looks like maybe versus a year ago? And then if you think about ITOM and platform those two together, what do you think will be sort of the more meaningful of the two as a growth driver getting you to that $4 billion number over the next several years? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : So Justin, as Frank said at the beginning, when our customers are buying and the way we sell leads, we really manage our business by the dollars we extract out of our customer and most of our customers are buying service management, not necessarily distinguishing between ITSM and the different service management applications we have. Long-term on that road to $4 billion, yes. ITOM will become a more meaningful piece of our business, but the majority of that revenue will still be coming from service management which ITSM is a part of. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael Scarpelli for closing remarks. Michael P. Scarpelli - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you very much and have a very good day.",

With the close of fiscal 2015 ServiceNow became the second enterprise SaaS company in history to report more than $1 billion in annual revenue. This milestone was driven by solid execution across the board; total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 44% year-on-year to $286 million and we continue to see strong demands from our customer base with a 99% renewal rate and a 39% upsell rate. The fourth quarter set the record for net new ACV. We now have 230 customers with ACV in excess of $1 million a net increase of 24. Additionally we have 638 Global 2000 customers a net increase of 26. New Global 2000 logos include Michelin and Hirschi Company our average ACV per Global 2000 customer was $868,000 a 6% sequential increase. At the beginning of 2015 we restructured our sales effort to increase focus on the commercial market. As a result we grew our commercial business 48% in the quarter in addition to robust growth the commercial sales team also booked multiple transactions in excess of $1 million throughout the year. Our total addressable market continues to expand and is now estimated to add $60 billion with our latest software release in December known as Geneva we launched two major new services that expand or scope into service management market, customer service and security operations adding more than an estimated $13 billion to our addressable market. Our customer service offering provides a holistic approach that integrates customer engagement with the underlying engineering and operational processes.  We already signed five deals for customer service including Pfizer the leading global provider of financial services technology. In addition we signed four customers for security operations including Raymond James Financial, a leading diversified financial services company. This new offering connects security events for market leading technologies with our advance work capabilities. A key value proposition is the institution of a shared workflow between IT and security teams. Our focus is not on detecting, but on processing security incidents in a highly structured experience and transparent fashion. This has been surely missing in the battle for cyber security. In 2016 our focus on helping customers, to transform their businesses using a service centric approach is intensifying, in this vision everything becomes defined and operated as a service and every enterprise will increasingly manifest itself as a software cloud. To help customers achieve this outcome we stood up and lead consulting team to map out their journey. This new team, which we call Inspire is currently working with a large customer to develop a long-term strategy around the industrial internet of things.  This customer plans to roll out a range of internal and external phasing cloud services that will more than triple our segment revenue by 2020. This is an existing customer, but this new engagement change the scope from an operational discussion to a strategic one. Another customer was in the midst of a corporate transformation along with the integration of a major acquisition instead of focusing just on an ITSM rip and replace the Inspire team showed them how IT could support the company\u2019s long-term transformation.  As a result we worked alongside to customers, stakeholders to build the strategy, roadmap and architecture for IT and a new business process service center that roadmap will have us replace seven systems in total starting with IT and moving throughout the business. Finally I look forward to seeing you all at the Knowledge \u201816 the week of May 16th in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. With that I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, Frank. During today\u2019s call we will review our fourth quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was $160 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $171 million. During the fourth quarter we generated $105 million in cash flow from operations and we used $25 million for capital expenditures resulting in $80 million in free cash flow. This compares to $39 million of free cash flow in the prior year. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments.

For those who cannot join in person, we will hold a webcast of the event accessible on our IR website. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Please proceed. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. Very strong margins, but a little light relative to the billings guide granted with a little bit where FX headwind, anything that happened similar to last year in terms of restructuring around the sales force? And then I have a follow-up question, just a housekeeping question. Frank Slootman : Hey, Michael. This is Frank. We don\u2019t have any restructurings planned for this year. So the realignment that you saw last year on to commercial organization, which by the way we highlighted in our prepared remarks, has really worked out excellent for our business. We\u2019re not planning on doing anything like that coming into 2016. Michael Turits : And then, Mike, anything further on that relative to the billings at the low-end of the guide, granted a little bit more FX headwind? Michael Scarpelli : Well, there is a number of things that go into billing that are both positive and negative when you\u2019re doing the forecasting. But I will say that there was an error in our forecasting. And if that error did not occur, we would have ended within -- we would have landed within the midpoint of our range. Michael Turits : Okay. And then I just have a housekeeping question. Can you let us know what your expectations are for the non-GAAP tax rate for 1Q \u201816 and 2016? Michael Scarpelli : For Q1 and all of \u201816, we\u2019re anticipating that it\u2019s going to be somewhere around 35%. Michael Turits : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed. Brent Thill : Thanks. Mike, just not to dwell on the billing, but just related to the error that you just mentioned, what was that? And also can you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re factoring in the macro condition for how you look at the billings guide? I think everything is obviously obsessed with that metric. Was there any more conservative view that you put into that or are you not seeing the macro at all show up in the pipeline in terms of the forecast that you gave to the street? Michael Scarpelli : The error had to do with looking at the system for what was our renewal opportunity that we had. And it was clearly an error that we captured and identified on December 15th. So, once again, if we had known that, we would have guided lower, and we would have ended within the midpoint of that the guidance we would have given. And I\u2019ll just say, our guidance is based upon where we see the business for 2016 right now, and we\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we\u2019re giving. Brent Thill : Okay. So no extra macro cushion that you\u2019ve factored in. Frank Slootman : This is Frank, Brent. I mean, we\u2019re not really seeing any macro effect yet. I mean, we\u2019re such a secular business. We know, we have not really felt any effects up to this point, nor can we see it sort of down the road that is affecting our business. So that\u2019s not in our guidance. Brent Thill : Okay. Just one more clarification, sales headcount accrued total headcount in this last year, do you anticipate your 1,000 net adds with the growth rate in sales hiring out -- continue to outpace the rest of the headcount? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. So we added roughly 405 people into the sales and marketing organization in all of 2015. And we expect in 2016 we\u2019re going to add about that same absolute number give or take depending on the quality of people we find. Brent Thill : Great. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Keith Eric Weiss : Thank you for taking the question. Two questions, one on the top-line and one on the bottom-line. On the top line, if we look at your guidance for the full year, particularly the billing guidance, you guys have very good sustainability of growth throughout the full year stating mid to low 30s throughout the full year, which isn\u2019t too much different from what you\u2019ve done in the most recent quarter on a constant currency basis. What gives you confidence in the sustainability of that growth what you\u2019re seeing in your pipeline in terms of the opportunity that could help you sustain that high level of growth despite the fact you guys are coming to a pretty big scale as you\u2019re at over a $1 billion? And then on the bottom-line, really nice free cash flows in this quarter. Anything one time in nature or anything we should keep in mind in terms of forecasting cash flows on a going forward basis that might need to be caught up at some point or do you think these sort of cash flow margin improvements are durable on a go forward basis? Michael Scarpelli : So I will answer the cash flow first, Keith. So you are going to get some variability in cash flow on a quarter-to-quarter basis and the two quarters where we\u2019re going to generally have our lower cash flow is going to be Q1 and Q2. And a lot of that has to do around our Q1 and Q3 and that has to do with our ESPP plan and the way that that gets funded. And you can see that on the cash flow statement. But we feel pretty good about showing some more leverage in our cash flow this year and hence why we\u2019re guiding to 24% for the full year. There is nothing big that\u2019s going to happen there. CapEx as a percent of revenue is going to be somewhere in the slightly down from last year I think we are about 9.5%, 9.4% in 2015. I\u2019m expecting it\u2019s going to be somewhere around 8%, 8.5% in 2016.  And then in terms of your other question and in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in our pipeline and I will let Frank talk what gives us the confidence there. Frank Slootman : Yeah, the confidence comes from the fact that we now have quite a few years of operating history under our belts. So we have seen those patterns are very persistent in terms of the way our renewals are working the way, our upsells are working the way we land new logos for averaged deal sizes the whole cohort analysis. You know, when you take all of that into account, we really have quite strong visibility in how the business plays out from one quarter to the next, and it\u2019s a nice thing about a SaaS business where you have also big backlogs and deferred [ph] that it\u2019s really rock solid that way. We really don\u2019t depend on one quarter or another being an outlier either to the positive or the negative. So it\u2019s really a function of our history in the business and the persistence of the patterns that we\u2019ve been able to observe. Keith Eric Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Matthew Hedberg : Thanks, guys. I guess I am wondering into year and I know there\u2019s always some deals that move in and out of a quarter but was there anything abnormal guys this quarter in terms of large deals that may have slipped into 2016? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. There are always deals that slip from one quarter to the other. Likewise, you are always pulling deals in. I will say like most Q4s it was a very backend loaded quarter. But as Frank mentioned, we had record net new ACV in Q4 and we\u2019re very pleased with what we saw. Matthew Hedberg : Okay. And then in terms of the full year guide, services revenue I think was about $30 million light of consensus in our number. And obviously you\u2019re having some success this quarter. Is that accelerating to the SI channels and is that something we should continue to bake into our model longer term? Michael Scarpelli : Yes, it\u2019s definitely something you should bake into your model as we\u2019ve been saying for a while. The SIs are becoming more important to us for doing service delivery, and we don\u2019t want to be seen as competing with the SIs. As I mentioned, we\u2019re trying to make our own internal PS resources kind of more strategic and we would like the kind of the basic implementation work to be done more and more by our partners. And hey, that\u2019s why the guys like CSV bought Fruition and Accenture bought Cloud Sherpas and we\u2019re going to let those guys continue to grow their businesses. We\u2019re more interested in the long-term subscription revenue from our customers. We just need to make sure that our partners are doing a good job of standing up our customers and want to really focus on that. Matthew Hedberg : Maybe a just quick follow-up to that. With this offloading to the SIs, is there anecdotal evidence that you are seeing an acceleration in that SI business due to the Cloud Sherpas or Fruition or things of that nature? Frank Slootman : Yes, this is Frank. There is an acceleration. Our SI business used to be opportunistic. In other words you know, when the opportunities presented itself they would bid on these opportunities, but it\u2019s different now. Because these organizations, they have bought companies, they have made investments and they now have real plans around to service in our business and to driving it to target. So they are much more disciplined, they are much more methodical, much more goal driven in the way they go about pursuing the ServiceNow business. And that\u2019s very, very different from the way it was in years past. As Mike said, we really want to make a room for them, make sure that we enable them. They also play a strategic role with our customers. And that\u2019s really important. We want our customers to have really a broad variety of choices and often times, we partner with these SIs as well. In other words, we will sub them or sometimes they sub us. So it\u2019s a very collaborative relationship that we have with them with our customers. Matthew Hedberg : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Mike I just wanted to dive into the question or the statement you made in the release and just mentioned on new ACV being at record levels, which I guess we would expect given that to Q4 you are a growing company. I am wondering, if I look at deferred commissions on the cash flow statement looks like the cash impact of that was roughly flattish year-over-year and your billings, I think we thought with forecasting but your billings you definitely benefited from the 99% renewal rate and I think is an all-time high for your company. So just wondering how we kind of quantify the new ACV and it grew but did it grow at the rates that it grown earlier in the year because it seems like maybe a slowed down a bit there? Michael Scarpelli : Well, I guess, the first thing Walter is, we don\u2019t disclose the actual net new ACV but you can see in looking at our deferred revenue and backlog that we just signed, you can see the gross increase in backlog and deferred revenue. And doing an apples-to-apples comparison of 2014, deferred commissions to 2016 is not -- or 2015 is not an apples-to-apples because the 2015 comp plan was not nearly as rich as the 2014 comp plan. I will say in our guidance going forward for 2016 we\u2019re making our comp plan a little bit richer next year. And that it all depends I would say in 2014 we had a lot more -- we had a lot of reps who really, really blew their number away with acceleration. This year we had guys into acceleration, but they weren\u2019t blowing the numbers away as much in acceleration. So you didn\u2019t have as much as bigger commission payments being paid out, but net-net, our net new ACV was up quite nicely year-over-year quarter. Walter Pritchard : Got it. And just a quick clarification on what Matt asked on the impact of services. I guess if we look at the delta between where you guided [indiscernible] of revenue and sort of where we were at, I am wondering, is the delta -- the impact on the lower [indiscernible] billing the same in other words the impact, that 1.6 number just trying to get a sense as to how the services may have impacted that number. Michael Scarpelli : Well, the services is pretty much any services revenue that is recognized flows through immediately into billing. There is nothing upfront with that. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Just want to make sure, that still the case. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Walter Pritchard : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Ted Lin : Hi. This is actually Ted Lin on behalf of Kirk. Just wanted to ask, can you guys talk about, whether you saw any extension of deal cycles or if you saw the initial size of deals change over the course of the quarter? Michael Scarpelli : No, really didn\u2019t see anything different in terms of deal cycle and deal sizes was pretty consistent from what we\u2019ve seen in the past. We had about 10 deals that were north of $1 million and that\u2019s been pretty consistent in that range. Ted Lin : Okay, thanks. Just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about any sort of momentum trends that you are saying with respect to your app store? Frank Slootman : This is Frank. That continues to grow quite nicely quarter-to-quarter. I don\u2019t have the numbers right off the top of my head. But the number of apps that have been contributed to the store number, number of downloads, all those metrics, they move sequentially quite a bit. So I think there is about 140, 150 applications up on the store now. And it\u2019s going to be quite active. So good progress there since we introduced it in the summer. Ted Lin : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. Please proceed. Alex Zukin : Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick ones. Maybe one for Mike first. Was there anything that you were disappointed by in the quarter? I mean if I look at the net new customer adds in 4Q versus 3Q they were down a little bit, 176 to 174, if I look at Global 2000 adds, they were also down sequentially a little bit, and obviously deferred revenue sequentially the growth was a little weaker than last two years. Is there anything at all that you were disappointed by outside of kind of the error around billings guidance? Michael Scarpelli : Really, just the error in the billings that, and I take full responsibility for that. Alex Zukin : Okay, got it. And then, Frank, maybe just a question about product. One, we\u2019ve heard a lot about verticalization in the industry, particularly from sales force mostly, but as you look at the global SI channel and how ordinate certain verticals are for you guys, can you talk at all about the strategy around verticalization either from a product perspective or from a go-to-market perspective in 2016? Frank Slootman : Yeah. So you\u2019re correct that the ADSIs of course have a very strong verticalized go-to-market motion, we\u2019ve not had that. The changes that we introduced during 2015 is that we went to a business unit structure. ServiceNow used to be single product, single market, mostly single channel type company. Last year that all changed. We\u2019ve broken our whole organization into business units. They\u2019re not verticalized, were organized by product. And we\u2019re seeing the effects of that quite dramatically, because the merchant products have taken off very, very strongly over the year. The business mix is changing very, very rapidly for ServiceNow, because these new products are taken off with a lot of momentum and that is impart because of the organizational structure and the resources that are behind it. So we\u2019re executing in that mode right now. And I\u2019m certainly not excluding the possibility that we will have a vertical vector to our go-to-market motion as well. But we\u2019re still in the middle of going through the transition to product which is working out really, really well for us, really, really happy with the progress we made in 2015, because that was really a big transition for the company to execute in that mode. I did talk about customer service. That\u2019s certainly something that initially is going to get really focused on technology type businesses, because we have very, very strong fit with the product there, but in the forms of time I think that will take a vertical focus as well, because that business is very different from one vertical to the next. Alex Zukin : Got it. And then, maybe on competition, as you go -- as you look at and as you launch customer service and the adjacencies between you and Salesforce grow, what -- how often do you see Salesforce and deals, what\u2019s that competitive framework look like going forward? Frank Slootman : Well, we see Salesforce in a number of places. Obviously, we feel we\u2019ve had sort of a borders skirmish around a product that they call RemedyForce, which is really a product by BMC that Salesforce also markets, that\u2019s based on the Force platform. That\u2019s not been a big competitive factor between us and Salesforce. Where we\u2019ve seen that more is in platform opportunities where customers are standing up, custom applications and they\u2019re trying to figure out whether they going to do it Force, or they\u2019re going to do it on ServiceNow. What I will tell you is that with our entry into customer service management, that\u2019s a head on collision with service cloud. And I said in the prepared remarks we\u2019ve done five or six major transactions already, and most of them were contentious with Salesforce and there is just no hiding from that reality. So it\u2019s going to become more intense between us and Salesforce as we get further into 2016. Alex Zukin : Got it, thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Abhay Lamba of Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks. This is Parthiv [ph] standing in for Abhay. Are you seeing customers implement the Geneva release for any new used cases, and any color on the possible effects of the release on ACVs would be very helpful. Thanks. Frank Slootman : Well, Geneva just came out in December. So all new projects will be -- that have gone live since that time they\u2019re going live hopefully most of them will be on Geneva. Typically our customer base just gear quite rapidly and in terms of new applications in Geneva; the two that I mentioned, security management there is a huge amount of interest in that new product, because it\u2019s such a no brainer to layer that on to the platform strategy that our customers have with ServiceNow. Then the other one that\u2019s a little bit further afield positioning wise around customer service. And we were quite sort of surprised how rapidly that took off as well because that\u2019s a different sales motion for us traditionally than selling to a core IT. But IT has always been a conduit and something that we can leverage very strongly to get into these new used cases. But we have very high expectations to continue on selling a lot of operations management, software applications. This was very strong in 2015, it will be very strong in 2016, and we have great expectations of these new services with Geneva in 2016 as well. We just had our global sales kickoff in Orlando last week and they were introduced to our sales organization for the first time. So there is a lot of energy brewing behind those initiatives. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed. Raimo Lenschow : Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions. Frank, you talked about IT ops there in your last answer, can you talk a little bit about how do you see that evolving in 2016 with Geneva in terms of like how meaningful will that be for you guys? Is it just a first step for customers to go in there, or do you think that\u2019s going to be already meaningful? And then I have one follow-up for Mike. Frank Slootman : Well, IT operations management anything last I think year went from 10% to 12% of our business, and it\u2019s not easy to do to grow your share of the pie considering that the whole pie is still growing at a blistering rate as well. IT operations management is an ideal add-on opportunity for our sales organization. It\u2019s just a natural leverage of the core platform. We\u2019re only, for example, with service watch, which is probably that we acquired about a year and a half ago, we just got down in the Geneva release with completely re-platforming that acquisition. That means that it runs on our cloud, it\u2019s re-implemented in our platform, our UI framework, it is a completely native ServiceNow service you can\u2019t really tell that that was acquired or that has origins from another company. We only have penetrated 5% of our customers with our product so far. And it\u2019s a red hot product, so there is enormous upside for us not just sell that, but it leverages everything else it\u2019s used by our security product, it\u2019s used in event management applications. So, operations management is -- there is an enormous amount of runway for us there, and we\u2019re going to be building other assets and potentially acquiring assets in that area as well. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, perfect. Interesting. And then a question for Mike. Mike, if you keep the hiring on sales and marketing constant, in a way, that kind of means is a less productivity for the existing guys keeps going higher. That basically means you have a guide path going down. What\u2019s the puts and takes on your plan for 2016 to kind of say or keep it constant because it\u2019s difficult to find new people versus I need to increase it if I want to keep the growth rate higher for longer? Thanks. Michael Scarpelli : Well, the driving factor behind adding roughly 400-plus people into our sales and marketing organization in \u201816 is we still truly do believe we\u2019re a more market constrained or, I mean, distribution constrained than market. There is still a lot of markets, especially in Asia Pacific where we\u2019re just starting to go into China and some of the other emerging markets in the world. And South America we actually had a very good quarter in South America last quarter, and we have high hopes. Remember, this is a long sales cycle. So it\u2019s going to take a year when we hire these people to really see were we able to get these people productive. And based upon the opportunity we see, we think that\u2019s the right number to continue to add people at that pace. Raimo Lenschow : Yeah. So the acceleration can only kind of like a lot of these are in the greenfield markets where you have to kind of see the market and go to market and then you could do something more. Is that the right way to think about it? Michael Scarpelli : Well, that\u2019s part of it. But remember, we are as well continuing to split territories in North America and EMEA because we\u2019re not saturated with salespeople. Listen, we still don\u2019t even have 50% of the Global 2000 in North America because a lot of those that still aren\u2019t covered yet. We need to have more people. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Karl Keirstead : Thanks. One for Mike and one for Frank. Mike, just to be clear and I think it\u2019s a question that Walter was trying to drive at a little bit earlier. If you look at your billings guidance for 2016 of 33% to 34% in constant currency, is there any way for you to sort of quantify what the slower growth in services and narrowing your services focus is having on that constant currency growth and if you would encourage the street as a result to focus a little bit more on subscription billings? And then, for Frank, I\u2019ll just throw it in now. Investor interest in AWS, Asher [ph] and the public cloud shift is very high. It\u2019s probably very early for you guys. But I\u2019m curious, among ServiceNow\u2019s customers that are making that journey, have you seen any impact and are there any ITOM or other tools that could actually see a demand as customers move workloads? Thank you, both. Michael Scarpelli : So, I guess, Karl, I\u2019ll answer first. The bulk of our billings comes from subscription, not from professional services. If you look at where our professional service guide in revenue, that is pretty much dollar for dollar what our total billings is going to be for subscription -- for professional services. Now, when you look at the balance, which is left there, which is the bulk of the $1.6 million the subscription, most of that is actually coming out of billing, our contracted backlog, then renewals and then new business. And our guidance is the $1.6 billion, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with right now. Frank Slootman : Karl it's Frank. Your question about public hybrid cloud. We actually think that that trend is very beneficial to ServiceNow. And the reason is we have never really focused on managing deep infrastructure. That\u2019s more been the legacy focus of companies like BMC and HP and IBM and CA. What we\u2019ve always done, we\u2019ve always focused on the service orientation, understanding the operational characteristics and availability performance of the services. That is just as important, actually it\u2019s even more important in a public cloud type of environment because customers will be deploying and redeploying constantly between these different platforms and understanding what services are affected by what cloud is what we do, and that\u2019s going to be really important. Secondly, I will tell you that our focus on service integration which really means is that we can really create a single service experience for all these different cloud resources, of the requesting of these resources or the provisioning of these resources, that\u2019s becoming an intense focus of our business as well. We are the company to provide that service integration infrastructure for the public cloud. So these are things that are going to help and fuel our business as opposed to become an impediment to our business because we\u2019re really not focused on deep infrastructure. That\u2019s been -- that\u2019s where the legacy companies have been, that\u2019s not where ServiceNow has been or where we are going. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Great color. Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Kasaro [ph] with Pacific Crest. Please proceed. Rob Owens : Yeah. Hi, guys. Rob Owens with Pac Crest. Couple of questions around the ITOM the opportunity. You mentioned about a 5% penetration rate at this point. Can you help me understand just with those customers what is done to ACV overall, I think 2016 was pointed to as kind of a critical year in inflection point for ServiceWatch, what metrics should we expect to see out of that portion of the business? Thanks. Michael Scarpelli : So the only new thing that we\u2019re going to start to disclose with our K which is going to get filed as we\u2019ve told people as now we are -- we started tracking ITOM revenue separately because it is license different than the rest of our products is done on a per device or person script basis. And so for 2015 ITOM revenue was 8% of our total subscription revenue and for the quarter it was actually 8.2% for Q4. And so that\u2019s the one new metric that you\u2019re going to start to see, and you will see that in our quarterly numbers as we go forward for 2016. Rob Owens : So if we think about that from a bigger picture, what\u2019s it typically add to a customer that\u2019s taking it in terms of ACV? Michael Scarpelli : You know, it depends upon the -- it depends upon the customer\u2019s environment. We have some customers that have almost doubled their ACV. We have others that are and these are we have a number of million dollar plus deals and it\u2019s really ServiceWatch has been a key piece of that, but it\u2019s not just ServiceWatch there is other things as well too. We have another customer who is paying us over about $6 million and almost two thirds of that is ITOM. So it depends upon the customer. Rob Owens : Thanks for the color, Mike. Frank Slootman : This is Frank. Rob I mean, we believe that the ITOM business from a revenue standpoint booking standpoint is easily equivalent to what we have had in service management and overtime will be bigger than that. Rob Owens : Thanks, Frank. Frank Slootman : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Please proceed. Greg McDowell : Great, thank you. Just one question for you Mike. We only get that backlog number once a year or so I wanted to drill a little bit into that for the full year up 40% constant currency. And I just want to ask, I mean there has been a pretty close historical relationship between the backlog and deferred and next year\u2019s revenue, and it does suggest again that it could be -- your 2016 revenue could be higher than your guidance you just provided. So I was just wondering is there anything different about the components of backlog this year than previous years, and maybe how FX is impacting what\u2019s in backlog? Thanks. Michael Scarpelli : So as we did mention that our backlog, our reported backlog, as of December 31st is $65 million year-over-year just because of FX is down, and once again, our guidance, we\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we gave for both our billings and revenue for 2016. Greg McDowell : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby, William Blair & Company. Please proceed. Justin Furby : First, on ITOM, Frank. I might have missed this, but can you call out in terms of new ACV in Q4 what that was and what it grew year-on-year and just curious when you think about fiscal \u201816 in your billings guidance, and the different areas of potential upside, what you think maybe is the biggest opportunity whether it\u2019s platform, ITOM certain geographies, different package apps, just anything that may surprise you to the upside and then I got a follow-up. Frank Slootman : Yes, I think ITOM for the full year, I think, grew around 66%, somewhere around there. So that\u2019s that number. As I said earlier, I have huge expectations of our efforts. We\u2019re doing very large transactions in this area. I think the market for ITOM is bigger, will be bigger than four IT service management and the combination of these products especially with the way we\u2019re approaching it, which is very different from what historically has been done. It is super compelling and ServiceWatch is a very catalytic technology because it helps customers understand what opportunities they have to really advance, how you manage services in an enterprise versus just managing infrastructure. So that\u2019s a big one. Obviously we have a lot more irons in the fire right now. So our business is just becoming very exciting because we\u2019re just pushing on a number of different areas and they are all moving, and this just we used to be a business that was driven primarily on the replacement of legacy helped us businesses that we have coming off a long way since that time. We are just becoming a very strategic platform for our customers. Justin Furby : Got it, and then, Frank, just a follow up. You talked a little bit about it I think maybe Mike did about the different comp plans, so just curious if you can give a little more color in terms of the thought process of fiscal \u201814 versus \u20185 and \u201816 and why it sort of changes back and forth there? Michael Scarpelli : I mean you are always trying to tweak your comp plan, and through our sales organization, there were decisions to change the plan and coming into 2016 now, we decided we wanted to make our plan a little bit richer because that will help attract people and retain people in our sales and marketing organization. Frank Slootman : This is Frank. The one thing that I can add to that, you\u2019re probably wondering why don\u2019t these plans will get cheaper consistently over time, again, it\u2019s not a spreadsheet. Sometimes when we\u2019re adding territories where people are going to need more time to get productive. We\u2019re not going to have an aggressive -- we are going to have an aggressive comp plan there, right. So the bigger you get, the more you are in nascent territories you have to tweak your plans to make sure that people have an opportunity to make money. So depending on what phase we\u2019re in, what territory we\u2019re in, you are going to see that move around. So I think we are being just very thoughtful that we are doing it the right way rather than taking purely a spreadsheet mentality to do that thing. Justin Furby : Got it. Thanks. And if I could just ask one more just on Q4 billing and I hate to go back to it, but services revenue Mike I\u2019m just curious if the difference between you being the midpoint of guidance versus beating it, does it have to do with services I guess did it surprise you in terms of the deflection to the partnering ecosystem or was it in line with what you thought for Q4? Michael Scarpelli : It was in line with what we thought for Q4, and it was purely a subscription renewal error. Justin Furby : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Jesse Hulsing : Thanks for taking my question. Frank, when you look at the mix of opportunities on the service management side of the house, how was the mix trending between what you might call traditional ITSM and finance facilities, HR, kind of the newer platform opportunities? Frank Slootman : Yeah, I don\u2019t have any sort of hard data to sort of characterize that in a very fundamental way. But more in a qualitative sense, the vast majority of our customers are now looking at service management really as an enterprise initiative, as an enterprise platform. They are looking at service integration strategies. They really don\u2019t want their organization to have to know that you have to go to IT for this thing, you got to go to HR for that thing. People shouldn\u2019t have to know what the boundaries between organizations are, especially when it comes to procurement. Does this go through IT? Does this go through facilities? Does this go through purchasing? So that\u2019s where organizations are looking to put a service cloud infrastructure in place where nobody needs to know what happens behind the curtain. That\u2019s the whole nature of cloud is that you obfuscate the whole backend infrastructure and you just don\u2019t need to know. You just submit your request and it gets automatically provisioned. It works the same way as Federal Express and Amazon information will find you, you don\u2019t have to keep checking back. That\u2019s really what our customers are after. Yes, oftentimes IT is the starting point. I think that will be the case for a long time to come because IT tends to be the leader in the organization that\u2019s really bringing the service model to the other service domain in the enterprise. But we probably have 300, 400 customers now that are on HR service management. That\u2019s growing a leaps and bounds. We have all business units around it. Customer service also ties in facilities management. That\u2019s a big area because that\u2019s now the external phasing side of service management. So we just think that we have just tons and tons of opportunity. The days that this was strictly an IT function, they are well in the past at this point. Jesse Hulsing : And a quick follow-up. I am looking at your investor deck and you\u2019ve broken out your addressable markets and provided a lot of granularity about how you are arriving at those numbers. But a lot of them are outside of traditional ITSM. Outside of ITOM which you have broken out metrics for, which one of those buckets, whether it\u2019s customer service or PPM or another bucket, do you expect to have the most growth in \u201816 and into \u201817? Frank Slootman : Well, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. All of those things are hot, they really are. They are on the move. Depending on who you ask, you will get a different answer. Security is red hot. Customer service surprised the hell out of us, the deals were very large. They were very rapid. They came from places that we didn\u2019t necessarily expect. So we\u2019re learning all kinds of things. The combination of PPM, which is project management and financials, is becoming a very hot commodity as well. We have such a nice opportunity upselling from our platform with all these different services. So it\u2019s great to be in sales at this company. Jesse Hulsing : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Steven Ashley : Thanks so much. I wonder if you could just comment first of all on ELA activity in the period if there was much and if you\u2019re seeing an increase in that? Michael Scarpelli : No, we really didn\u2019t see the ELAs in the period at all. It was our typical licensing. Steven Ashley : Great. And then, lastly, ITOM, everyone has been drilling on it and you guys have pointed out that really there is a great enterprise opportunity. Is that also a commercial/mid-market opportunity with the ITOM products? Frank Slootman : Well, absolutely, there is. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever set something to the contrary, that really doesn\u2019t stop at the large enterprise doors. Our products scale down very nicely. Even in Express, one of the things that we have added to Express was our discovery kit ability. That was one of the things that was glaringly missing in the first incarnation of that product. People had to have that. And you\u2019re talking about really small shops now that want to be able to discover all the laptops and desktops and service that they have and be able to manage the operating histories. So ITOM is integral to any service management deployment, whether it\u2019s huge or whether it\u2019s small. Steven Ashley : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Kash Rangan : Hey, guys. Thank you. I\u2019m just looking at the stock down about 50%, big move, and I\u2019m wondering to myself, as solid as your growth is, there is a bit of deceleration in billings relative to where you were at the start of the year whether you look at ACV of your G2K, the growth rate there, the sequential deferred revenue growth rate. Now, on the flipside, you are turning way the hell more profitable than anybody expected about a year back or so. So, clearly, your cash flow and op income generation are significantly ahead of people\u2019s expectations. But the growth did decelerate a little bit. And I do completely appreciate the point that you -- had you known what you knew on December 15th, the numbers would have been right in line midpoint or even high-end, perhaps. Is this merely a conscious decision on your part to slow down the rate at which you\u2019re -- not slow down the rate at which you\u2019re hiring, but the second derivative sales headcount you\u2019re adding 400, you added last year 400 is it a conscious decision that as you progress being a larger company going through revenue deceleration that you get that natural margin expansion or is it that the market itself is somewhat limited that you have to slow down the growth rate and not necessarily keep up that $1 billion business growing 50% as you have been at the start of this year? Frank Slootman : This is Frank. Maybe, again, I can put a little bit of an angle to this. We went and we are still going through a bit of a transformation in the sense that we are becoming a multiproduct, multimarket and even multichannel type company. Before we were literally scaling on the single product, single market, single channel and by the way that went exceptionally well for us, but the transformation as I just described it is not trivial one over a year ago we completely changed our product organization to be able to drive on multiple fronts at the same time. And we have gradually implemented that focus throughout the organization in the solution consulting teams, which is a pre-sales organization and the sales organization itself, so that we can bring that multiproduct orientation to the entire company. That\u2019s not an easy transition to go through. You just don\u2019t keep sort of ramming bodies and maintain the same momentum. Because there are different kind of hiring profiles, skill profiles, different organizations that absorb these people. But we went through a ton of that transition in 2015 and we feel we\u2019re in a really, really good place to be able to grow and expand with the structure and the model that we have. We\u2019ll be able to buy assets, we\u2019re able to build assets and really add-on to our model. So that\u2019s probably the best explanation that I can give. Obviously, there is large numbers as well. We just cruised through the $1 billion full year revenue. We haven\u2019t been there yet right, and so we\u2019re also getting used to the scale and size of everything that\u2019s going on in this company. We have offices in 64 different places around the world. It\u2019s becoming a good size business and we\u2019re growing into it and we\u2019re pushing hard. So feeling good -- feeling very good about where we are in our evolution. Kash Rangan : Got it. And one for Scarpelli, no change to close rates in Q4 relative to Q4 last year, or was there any change sequentially year-over-year, and if yes, what kind of close rate assumption are you using for your billings forecast, Mike, for 2016? That's it from me. Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : So first of all, we never disclose close rates\u2026 Kash Rangan : Directionally\u2026 Michael Scarpelli : There was nothing unusual about this Q4 in comparison to last Q4. And I am comfortable with the guidance we gave for 2016. Kash Rangan : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed. Derrick Wood : Thanks. Frank, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the strength to the commercial business and the productivity you\u2019ve seen there, but didn\u2019t hear any commentary on the enterprise side. Could you just characterize the kind of the level of productivity tracking out of that segment? Frank Slootman : Yeah, there was a reason I mentioned the commercial businesses because you guys got so rattled a year ago, and it took several quarters to shake that off. So, I thought I\u2019d just make a few -- put some color on that business, because it\u2019s been a very successful transformation for us. The reality is our business is sort of 50-50 large enterprise global on the one hand, and then the commercial business the other half. So we have to really drive both sides of that business equally hard. I mean, our growth assumptions are based on both those business be able to sort of maintain that 50% share of the overall pie. But there\u2019s no doubt that if you left everybody here to their own devices, we would gravitate towards the very large enterprise, because those are the most productive, most lucrative business relationships that we have in this company. And that\u2019s the reason why we created the commercial organization, because we were not to let that happen. We were going to make sure that we would have dedicated focus on these other markets. It\u2019s more fragmented, the deals are smaller, but still outstanding business for us and we like it. Michael Scarpelli : And Derrick, just to support the strength in enterprise, we did add 26 Global 2000 in the quarter. It was actually 33 with adjustments with acquisitions and stuff. So we now have 638 Global 2000 and you saw that we now have over 200 -- we have 230 customers that pay us over $1 million a year each. I think the average is right around $2.1 million. Derrick Wood : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then\u2026 Michael Scarpelli : And that continues to grow. Derrick Wood : Okay. And then, Frank, you mentioned the CSC and Accenture having acquired two of your biggest partners. Just be curious to hear how those relationships have evolved? Has there been any disruption or vice versa, are you using were tailwinds with kind of resources and pull through? Just to hear about how those evolved that would be helpful. Thanks. Frank Slootman : Yeah. It\u2019s actually made our relationships with those folks more intense, more strategic. We\u2019ve just become more important, in relative terms to them as a platform than we were before they made these acquisitions. Right? So the fun and games is over with. We now have real live investments in it. The real business is they have managers, they have plans, they have targets. Accenture was a premier sponsor at our global sales kickoff last week. This is a really big growth opportunity for them and we\u2019re happy to be partnering with them. We were -- the nice thing about having folks like CSC and Accenture is they have transformational capabilities that they can bring to our very large customers. We\u2019re really raising the expectations on what outcomes people really should expect from ServiceNow deployment. So we\u2019re thrilled to have these people in our business and our customers are happy as well. They have real good variety of choices, a very broad pool of talent to engage. That\u2019s been a complaint that we historically have had is that we grew very rapidly and we were always exhausting the resources in the marketplace. So this is one of the reasons why we\u2019ve carefully cultivated our ecosystem. We didn\u2019t want to crowd out our partners, because we would really constrain our own growth if we did that. So I think these relationships are great, and they\u2019re going to be growing and more important -- become more important as we go on here. Derrick Wood : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Phil Winslow : Hi. Thanks guys for taking my questions. Frank, you mentioned this in your continuing sort of increasing TAM or just applicability of your guys' services, security, customer service, et cetera. And when you think about just the go-to-market strategy here, is there anything changing as you just continue to expand the applicability in \u201816 versus \u201815? I know you talked on the comp plan, but anything sort of structural to the Salesforce on the go-to-market strategy? And then, a quick follow up to just for housekeeping items. Wonder if you just quantify the billings error there and was it $4 million, $5 million, just sort of how much lower would have guidance with that? Michael Scarpelli : So the billing error was $5 million. Frank Slootman : On your question, Phil. This is Frank. The structural difference that we started that we have embarked on and that\u2019s still going on is that we have a high degree of product specialization in the various organizations, and we started that on the pre-sales side. We have it on the sales side. We have it on the professional services side. Obviously this all started in the -- with the product team. So our whole organization has a fully built out product dimension to it. And but not all GEOs have the same amount of product specialization. So that investment will be ongoing as we scale we will be having more and more dedicated resources that relate to these specific areas. You can imagine the security management, we are not a security company by our DNA set if you will, but we stood up a product organization with nothing but security people in there. We have always had security people in the field because being a cloud company security is a really big topic of conversation with our customers. But we have to have very dedicated, very specialized people to be very effective and credible with our customers to drive those kinds of businesses. But the opportunity is so great that for us to make those investments is a no-brainer and that\u2019s what we are doing. Phil Winslow : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : There are no further questions. Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Michael Scarpelli for closing remarks. A - Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the investors section of our website. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your first speaker for today, Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. Have your floor sir. Michael Scarpelli : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our Chief Executive Officer.

I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman : Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. We\u2019re off to strong start in 2016 with our best first quarter ever. Revenues grew 44% year-on-year to $306 million driven by strong demand from new business and 97% renewal rate. Our Global 2000 business continues to grow at a consistently high rate with 22 new customers during the quarter including TATA Steel Limited and the Bank of Ireland. Our average our per Global 2000 customer was $906,000, a 4% sequential increase and a 21% year-over-year increase. In our two keys transforms we\u2019ve noted first, upsells continue to be a leading growth factor as current customers expand their service and our usage. We now have 249 customers each with annualized contract values in excess of $1 million, an annual increase of 48%. We landed a record 13 upsells in the quarter each with new ACV greater than $1 million. Our Q1 tends to be a seasonally challenging quarter, we recorded two of our largest upsells ever. An existing Global 2000 customer signed a $20 million upsell over five years increasing its commitment by approximately 380%. The upsell was driven by significant product expansion including service-watch, platform and project portfolio suite. Another existing Global 2000 customer signed a $10 million upsell over five years doubling its initial 2015 contract value and this upsell was driven by the adoption of an enterprise license agreement. The second key trend is excellent growth in customer traction within our emerging products. In Q1 we saw new ACV from IT operations management grow a 166% year-over-year and represents 16% of total new ACV, up from 7% a year ago. This was driven in large part by the success of service-watch which was fully re-platform on ServiceNow in December. We\u2019ve a tremendous opportunity to upsell service-watch to our existing customers given the low penetration of this technology. The success of the service-watch acquisition has pioneered in model, acquire strategic assets and talent that strengthen our overall portfolio and then re-implement the assets to leverage to full benefits of the ServiceNow platform. This is the same strategy we will use with our acquisition of ITapp earlier this month as more enterprise workloads move to public and hybrid clouds, we\u2019re in a strong position to provide customer with visibility and control of the cloud application services. ITapp represents the reinvention of operations management for cloud hosted applications world. We expect to complete the re-platforming of ITapp in 2017. Of the item, we\u2019re pleased with the only progress of security operations and customer service. During the quarter we signed an 11 new security customers including 4 in the Global 2000. One customer in highly regulated industry broaden ServiceNow to eliminate it\u2019s manual and unstructured security processes and decrease its overall exposure. The customer sees our solution as key to improve in collaboration and getting better leverage out of the security investments. We landed 11 new customer service management logos in the quarter including three Global 2000. We are seeing good traction in the tech enabled industries including software, telecom managed services, financial services, government and healthcare. Customers are choosing us over CRM based products because of the holistic service management approach which includes incident, problem and change management disciplines. This provides a better closed loop solution not only to improve the quality of the service but also of the core product. Also worthy of note, we achieved FedRAMP certification in February significant milestone for our federal business. This multi-year effort to meet the government's most rigorous technical standard for cloud computing will have a material impact on our ability to sell into the federal market for years to come. ServiceNow operates the only enterprise service management cloud platform granted this highest level of FedRAMP certification. And finally, I look forward to seeing you all at our knowledge conference in next month in Los Vegas. We expect to surpass 10,000 attendees another record in the history of our conference. With that I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, Frank. During today's call we will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q2 and full year 2016. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarter's previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. Total revenues for the first quarter were $306 million, increasing 44% year-over-year. Foreign exchange fluctuations did not significantly impact our actual year-over-year revenue or billings growth. Of our total revenues, subscription revenues were $267 million increasing 49% year-over-year and professional services and other revenues were $38 million increasing 20% year-over-year. We are pleased with the continued evolution of our partner ecosystem and expanding role they play in ServiceNow deployment. Our average contract terms for new customers\u2019 upsells and renewals were 32.0, 22.8 and 25.5 months respectively. Total revenues based on geography were $211 million in North America, $74 million in EMEA and $21 million in Asia-Pacific and other representing 69%, 24% and 7% of total revenues respectively. Billings were $377 million in the quarter increasing 41% year-over-year. We realized approximately $1 million in additional billing due to the increase in average foreign exchange rates during the quarter compared to the beginning of the year. Our average billings duration was 11.7 months for the first quarter unchanged from the same period in the prior year. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 84% compared to 81% in the prior year. Professional services and other gross margin was 10% compared to 9% in the prior year. Overall gross margin was 74% compared to 70% in the prior year. Operating margin was 8% compared to 3% in the prior year. We ended the quarter with 3,991 total employees, a net increase of 305 in the quarter. Net income for the first quarter was $14 million or $0.09 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $2 million or $0.02 per basic and $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding were $162 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $170 million. Free cash flow margin was 22% compared to 19% in the prior year and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, short term and long term investment. Let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2016 based on foreign exchange rates at the end of the first quarter, we are not forecasting a significant impact to our expected year-over-year revenue or billings growth due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation. Additionally, we do not expect the recent acquisition of ITaap to have a material impact on our 2016 guidance. For the second quarter 2016, we expect total revenues between $332 million and $335 million representing year-over-year growth between 35% and 36%, this includes subscription revenues between $284 million and $286 million representing year-over-year growth between 42% and 43% and professional services and other revenues between $48 million and $49 million representing year-over-year growth between 4% and 6%. Professional services and other revenues guidance includes approximately $11 million related to knowledge with the related expenses of approximately $26 million recorded in sales and marketing. Moving onto billings. We expect billings between $370 million and $375 million representing year-over-year growth between 31% and 33%, this includes subscription billings between $330 million and $335 million representing year-over-year growth between 37% and 39% and professional services and other billing of approximately $40 million which is flat to the prior year. We would like to remind you that our average billings duration in Q2 2015 was unusually high at 12.2 months due to one large customer requesting multi-year billings. As noted on our Q2, 2015 earnings call, this increased our billings by approximately 10 million when compared to the same period in the prior year. For Q2, 2016 we do not expect substantial customer request for multi-year billings and our guidance assumes a billing duration of 11.7 months which is in-line with the historical averages. For year-over-year comparison purpose at our Q2, 2016 billing guidance including constant billings duration of 12.2 months, our guidance would have been included approximately 14 million of additional billings. As a result year-over-year total billing growth would have been between 36% and 38% instead of 31% and 33% and year-over-year subscription billings growth would have been 43% and 45% instead of 37% and 39%. For additional information on cost and billings duration please refer to our IR presentation. Turning to gross margin we expect subscription gross margin of approximately 83%, professional services and other gross margin excluding knowledge revenue of approximately 11% and overall gross margin excluding knowledge revenue of approximately 75%. We expect an operating margin of 7% including net expenses of 15 million related to knowledge and free cash flow margin of approximately 22%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately $172 million. For full year 2016, we expect total revenues between $1.355 billion and $1.380 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 35% and 37%. This includes subscription revenues between $1.195 billion and $1.210 billion representing year-over-year growth between 41% and 43% and professional services and other revenues between $160 million and $170 million representing year-over-year growth between 2% and 8%. We expect total billings of approximately $1.6 billion representing year-over-year growth of approximately 33%, this includes subscription billings of approximately $1.42 billion representing year-over-year growth of 37% and professional services and other billings of approximately $180 million representing year-over-year growth of 10%. We expect an operating margin and free cash flow margin of approximately 12% and 24% respectively. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be $173 million for the year and we expect to add approximately 1,000 net employees in 2016. As a reference in our 8-K filing last week, we have settled all outstanding litigation and have no ongoing expenses. There is no impact to our products or services as a result of these settlements. Under the terms of the settlements, we are prohibited from disclosing any information that is not exclusively stated in the 8-K filing. All settlement amounts have been excluded from non-GAAP results. Please note, our financial Analyst Day will be held in conjunction with Analyst Conference on Monday, May 16th in Las Vegas at Four Seasons. Please send an email to ir@servicenow.com if you would like to attend in person. For those who cannot join in person, we will hold a webcast of the event accessible on our IR website. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much, and congrats in the quarter. Yes, Frank, I just want to ask you, obviously last year you put in the commercial sales organization and that was a big undertaking. I was wondering if you just talk a little bit about how that going for you all in terms of bringing in net new customers that you may even talking to last year at this time. And then just talk about the strong start of this year in terms of just execution having everybody in place, even how much of that was reflected in the results today? Thanks very much. Frank Slootman : Yes, Kirk, we're actually super placed with the progress that our commercial sales organization which we really stood up in the US. That's what our announcement a year ago was about. So, we now have a whole year of experience under our belt. That organization grew in excess of a 100% on bookings over the last year. So, that's really good. Commercial market is really important in the long-term basis. We cannot just be driving our business from global 2000 accounts. So, these investments have to be made and are actually feel that they're paying off well ahead of schedule here. In terms of your second question, we've been diligently working on all the changes that we have to make the company in terms of preparing ourselves to go to market with multiple products and multiple markets and multiple channels. And as you can see from the results that is gradually paying off, but it's a marathon one quarter, is not the entire story. So, we're pleased with the results showing that the investment we're making are yielding. So, we were at that place. Kirk Materne : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Thanks for taking my question. Guys, congrats on the quarter as well. Mike, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about the eco system. I am wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail there, the Sis should certainly provide that, we think of a benefit going forward here. I'm not only into the services mix shift, but selling additional non sort of core apps. Can you talk about some of the progress you're seeing there? Michael Scarpelli : So, as part of our Analyst Financial Analyst Day, we're going to talk more about the impact of the G SIs. Right now we're still trying to figure out some meaningful matrix that we can share with this tree. As I mentioned before in Q4, we were looking at some new matrix and how we would report that and we just haven\u2019t made any decisions and we will start to talk about that at our Analyst Day. Matt Hedberg : Okay, and then maybe one more, I know headcount, additions is always critical matric for you guys adding talent. I'm curious you had a nice headcount adding Q1 here and it sounds like a 1000 for the years is pretty consistent. Are you having less churn right on their which is a more capacity a new plant foregoing into the year? Michael Scarpelli : No, I don\u2019t think there is more capacity. We did see kind of in the last kind of in March we start to see some churn within our organization, but we're kind of where we need to be right now. There was a fair bit of want to churn that we really worked on. You usually see that in Q1, was more towards the end of the quarter but we're comfortable with the capacity we have on hand now. That\u2019s all reflected in our operating margin guidance for the year. Matt Hedberg : All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Frank, back to your comment about this steam the cash best Q1 ever, beyond the couple of mega contracts that you sign. Can you just give us a little more sense of that what why you would characterize as your best Q1. What are the other things that surprised you and stood out in Q1? Frank Slootman : Well, the reality is that for high growth company like ours. Every quarter sort of has to be our best quarter ever. So, this is not sort out of the ordinary for us to observe that about our business. But as I said in the prepared remarks, one of the things that was super strong is our whole upsell dynamic in our business. I think we're unusually in the whole SaaS universe, how strong our app store business is. So, we have a really good ability to land even with modest presence and have the ability to dramatically expand that in a relatively short period of time. We really like that sales dynamic and the reason is it's much harder to do very large transactions from start where you have zero presence in account. So, once we have established that beach has the our ability to sell and accelerate that presence is well established and we liked it at launch. Brent Thill : And then quickly, for Mike, just on the two large mega contracts. Did you disclose what was built versus what hearing in Q1 or all those some of that built in Q1, was that related built bill? Michael Scarpelli : Well, all of those contracts are their annual billings. There was some co-term that happened and on average they're coming in at about an 11.7 months as factored into our overall billings guide. Brent Thill : Okay, great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats as well. Quick question, so now that you have and is a focus for you guys as well, do sell a broader product portfolio. How did you set up the salesforce for this year? Are they carrying quotas for all the different product? How do you intent to like them to kind of go out and continue to do the ups cross sale that you're already seeing? Frank Slootman : Raimo, this is Frank. Our people are carrying a global quota and they can choose how they retire quota. We obviously have overlays built into our sales model and now especially on the solution consulting site, but also on the sales side. People that have dedicated number, dedicated to products. We are beginning to move in a direction where for product lines that there are farther afield from our normal sales dynamic where we're going to have dedicated teams. In other words, sales teams that can only sell that product line. We haven\u2019t done that yet. We are moving in that direction. And that sort of a new chapter in our evolution of our sales model, if you will and we'll report on that as we go along here. But generally speaking, no, there is one quota and they retire that in the best way they know how. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, perfect. And then last, just to clarify like, you know, lastly you obviously had quite a few changes in terms of sales territory and to split. Am I not correct to assume that this year was very minimal changes? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Michael, do you think about the past to the $4 billion plan you put out with the Global 2000 customer growth. I think the one thing that strikes me there is you\u2019ve had great traction in the US. You have a really good market sharing in Europe as well in Asia, still I think its 7% market share. Can you talk just about specifically that geography and your competitive position there, sort of where you see the encumbrance, I think they could be stronger today than the newer as well as you\u2019re the evolution you go to market organization and your ability to ramp the market share in Asia like you have in these other two geographies. Frank Slootman : Yes, this is Frank, Walter. Now, Asia is sort of a tail of two regions. We've done exceptionally well in Australia. We got in early and we've really outperformed our own expectation in that market really great accounts and really great presence. It's a very mature organization. Now, that's in contrast to what's going on in Asia and Japan where we got a much later start and where we are still relatively immature. Those are very different routes to markets. And we're still in the midst of really figuring out how to best do business there. We are making that way, we are selling, we are getting customers. But as you observe from the percentage, this is not yet kicking in the way we would like it to Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thanks, very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question and nice quarter. I want to drill into the legal settlements from far from two side, if you can go into it. One from a topline perspective. Think to any pent up demand behind settling those losses, people who were maybe sitting on the side lines, who sale cycles that got extended because of what you guys had to do to convince people that it wasn\u2019t liability or it wasn\u2019t risk behind this. That's the one side equation. Then on the other side of the equation, is there any OpEx that was sort of in the budget in the model for this year that now comes out because you're a little bit more in for investment or margin expansion that I should be aware of? Frank Slootman : Keith, this is Frank. I'll answer the first question and then I'll let Mike answer the second question. So, the answer to your first question is really not, there the litigation was a slight overhang in the sense that it cost some distraction and some friction. I'm not aware of it causing any business not to happen. So, I don\u2019t think there is any pent up demand that we're envisioning, that's going to free up here with the settlement? Michael Scarpelli : In terms of the cost associated with the litigation, we have incurred cost in Q1 through the settlement and actually into April. The budget has in essence been reallocated for the ITapp acquisition and that's why we said ITapp acquisition we don\u2019t expect to have any material impact on our guidance for the year. And hence while we let in at the 12% operating margin. So, we will see a shift between G&A and R&D, but that's not going to drop to the bottom line. Keith Weiss : Excellent, this one. Well, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hi, guys, two quick ones from me. First off, congratulations on the quarter. If you look at your pipeline from an ACV perspective, from new versus existing customers. How does it look like this year versus the prior year? Michael Scarpelli : Well, as our install base and customers get bigger, upsells becomes a bigger piece. So, obviously our ACV pipeline is bigger this year for new customers than it was last year. And it's bigger for two reasons. One, because they're install base customers is bigger but also our sales force is a lot bigger now. Alex Zukin : All right, that's helpful. Any update on the app store initiative, how that's been trending versus your expectations at any sense of what percentage of revenue or bookings is coming from platform license at this point? Frank Slootman : This is Frank. That continues to trend upwards. We are realizing substantial amounts there, but it's not of the order of magnitude where we think we need to call it out in our prepared remarks and so on. It's a long-term investment you'll see at our conference in Vegas last month. Next month that we have a good portion of the conference dedicated to platform, platform enable months, store, is really helping people monetize their investments that are making on the platform. But we are not view, depending on this or viewing this as a major impactful source of business in the current time frame. Alex Zukin : That's helpful, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits : Hey Guy, Michael Turits. Two questions. One, Frank and Mike, you pulled out a lot of applications including security and others. And now you're also talking about rolling potentially rolling out some, sounds like overlay sales force. It seems like it's working really well. Is there any more cost associated with this as opposed to what seems like your earlier strategy which was more of a platform and strategy with customers and partners developing application? Frank Slootman : It's Frank, Michael, now. That really because the way we view it is we look at how well we develop pipeline both in the aggregate as well as by different classes of products. So, we're going to allocate head counts in our sales organizations in such a way that drives the development of demand, the quickest. So, it's really -- we can either sub divide, continue to sub divide territories, or we can move them into a product classes and then at this point where we're seeing demand developing faster when we start dedicating more resources to these new product opportunity. So, it really is not incremental in terms of cost. Michael Turits : And then, a follow-up question I have in sort of different direction. But, you raise the revenue guide but not the billings guide. Is something to get clarity in terms of duration going into next quarter but in last quarter and fourth quarter there was some duration issues especially to the shorter end. Is it, do you feel like you have got to handle on where duration is going, any risk that you could have customers looking for much shorter duration even some one year and is that part of, any lack of visibility on the billings for the full year? Frank Slootman : No, what I would say is there is a lot more judgment that goes into billings, forecasting billings than the recent subscription revenue just because it's very easy to pull in renewals, customers can delay renewals. And if a contract is signed in the last day of the quarter or the day one of the next quarter that can emphasis a big contract that could have a $5 million impact or $5 million contract for revenue on the last day of the quarter as zero impact on your revenue. Hence why, we said at the beginning of the year, our full year's billing guidance is approximate, last year we never gave you billings guidance for the full year until the second half. And in the second half of this year we will give you a more accurate or an actual range of where we think the billings guidance is going to be for the full year. Michael Turits : Great, thanks very much. Thanks Frank. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jesse Hulsing : Yes, thanks guys, appreciate it. ITaap, Frank can you talk about the acquisition and the timeline for integration and also when you think about how this ITaap portfolio of solutions of all overtime, how much is going to be driven by M&A versus internal development? Thank you. Frank Slootman : Yes, the whole notion of cloud management has been on our radar for years and we have had our own internal development in this area as well and a bunch of our customers are using our provisioning capabilities for EWS and as you are in and things like that. We have prosecute opportunities to buy technology in this area for a while now and we are pleased that we succeeded in acquiring this company. We are going to fully re-platform meaning that this is not going to be integrated, we don't do an equation, we do re-implementation and that means it's going to run on our clouds, on our platform, in our UI framework there really be no seams, no separation between these services and the ones we have built previously that's going to be completed sometime during the first half of 2017. This is not trivial technology it takes time to mature because there is just a ton of variables that this kind of software needs to take into account it's not a simple application at all. We think this is a marketplace or segment of the marketplace that is in its infancy and it's going to take considerable amount of time for people to learn and understand how to deploy this. It\u2019s a complete reinvention of how operations management and system management really works in a cloud hosted environment. So we need to own this. It is strategic to us. The reason is that it is a key resource that gets requested and provisions through our platform, so the ability to provide that is very, very important we cannot, not be in this marketplace we got a very strong response from our large Global 2000 customers saying this is exactly the right thing for you to be doing. So it's nice to see that kind of validation of strategy when we announced this deal. Jesse Hulsing : Thanks Frank. Frank Slootman : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : Thanks. It's Hindlian. Congratulations guys on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions too. I was wondering if you could give us some color around what drove your strong upsell. Do you really view that Mike and Frank as seat expansion or you are thinking about that in terms of ARPU growth and when we are considering this upsell could you give us a little bit more color as well on where you are seeing the most traction and then maybe I can sneak in one more question, but maybe this is little bit redundant but are you seeing any seat contraction in the core ITSM product from any sort of public cloud usage at all? Frank Slootman : This is Frank, yes, to your last question is no. Not at all, but yes to your first question in terms of what drives the upsells. What\u2019s really going on is that in our customer base people are really gaining the confidence to have longer relationships and bigger relationships with us. They are stepping up in a much more strategic sense. The notion I am just going through replace some legacy apps, do some modernization that's sort in a rearview mirror. They are moving with much stronger strategic intent on ServiceNow as a key platform in their overall technology portfolio and that's really what\u2019s driving. And big upsells really reflect strategic intent on the part of our customers, which is why we called it out in our prepared remarks because we think it's really core to what\u2019s going on with our company. Michael Scarpelli : With those upsells we are seeing both seat expansion and new products as we introduce new products especially ITOM and some of the newer products with customer security and customer service. Sarah Hindlian : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Pacific Crest. Your line is open. Rob Owens : Great and thanks for taking my question. I want to drill down just a little bit into the security operations opportunity and I think you had said you had four customers in backlog or in trial when you released the product. You mentioned 11 new security customers. I am curious as to exactly what they are doing. You mentioned eliminating manual security process, so is this automating changes within infrastructures or more automation of IT task number one and just maybe at a high level customer example of how they are using it? Thanks. Frank Slootman : Yes Rob it's Frank. This is really into the management for security that's the simple way to think about it. What\u2019s going on in the world of security is that enterprises and institutions make huge investments in detection and scanning all the companies that you are familiar with in that universe. But as the scanning and detection takes place, the ability to process and act on those events is incredibly immature. The security operation centers is comprised of these people sitting around desk, staring at screens and spreadsheets and texting each other and talking to the IT department there is really no sense of disciplined structure and work flow to dealing with these alerts. Now on the IT side we have that because we have matured that over the last 10-20 years we\u2019re very, very disciplined in that area and the reason we\u2019ve had to be that way is because of the sheer volume. Well, that reality is now sinking on the security side of the house as well and the second reason is that security and IT have to work together. There is no other way and the reason is when security people need something done on the IT infrastructure they do not have the authority or the ability to make those changes. Those are going to run through IT. So making sure that the workload is integrated within security and IT that is what we do. That is what this product does. The response to the basic concept of what this new product does has been incredibly strong and there has been a lot of action in the marketplace as well, IBM acquired a competitor there has been a number of acquisitions in this area, everybody is waking up to this basic capability. We just happen to be very, very well equipped with an extremely matured rich platform to be able to tackle this. Now we are not a security company by background, but we have staffed up in the entire organization with security people to go and prosecute this and as I said earlier we are also going to adapt our selling motion to make sure that we fully explore the opportunity that is presenting itself. Rob Owens : And are there any go-to market technology partners then from content perspective and I assume you talking about the resilience system acquisition by IBM or is this more from the peer work flow perspective? Frank Slootman : This is from the peer work flow expected. There is a huge ecosystem play here because all the folks that are on the detection and scanning side in terms of follow ups, networks, fire eye etcetera those all become key partners for us in this game as is Plunk and so on. But we think security is such a fragmented diverse world having a single integrated work flow is going to be incredibly important for that whole process to work and be functional. I think everybody knows that a lot of the big breeches that we have seen advertised on the front pages of the Wall Street Journal is not due to our inability to detect them, it's due to our inability to act on them and that's really where we come in. Rob Owens : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Steven Ashley : Thanks so much. I just wanted to ask on ITOM, which modules are you seeing the strongest adaption for here in the early going? Frank Slootman : This is Frank. ITOM, actually the great thing about ITOM is, we are selling it as a suite. So in other words it's not sold in individual pieces. Now that said discovery is a core capability because that's what populates the CMDB, I mean we believe our ability has to have that orchestration is really the ability to bring about change in the on premise infrastructure, so the penetration on that has grown a lot. Service-watch has been a runaway success for the company as we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Yet and the value of the transactions is quite high. Yet, the penetration in our customer base is still single digits. So, we have an enormous opportunity yet to go with ITOM, but the whole thing is it's a very holistic approach it's not a point and product sale for us. Steven Ashley : Great. And then, I just like to ask one follow-up question on the sales force organization. You talked in the last conference call about the fact that last year you transitioned, you had to go to more of a business unit kind of structure Australia you talked about having dedicated sales teams for certain products. Can you give us just a little more color on the current sales force structure around how it's laid out today? Frank Slootman : So the sales force structure essentially has sort of four quadrants if you will. We have a global accounts organization and we both have a new logo organization, a resource or focus if you will as well as an existing accounts focusing organization. We have the same thing on the commercial site, we have a new account, hunting focus into commercial organization and we have one that takes care of existing customers. That model is quite mature in North America when you get over to Europe and Asia where we are not as mature we don't have the mass due to bring about that entire focus. You see the separation at the rep level but not yet at the organizational level. That will happen in four months time because those model will eventually carry through the way that I described. But the two vectors are commercial versus enterprise, and the other vectors is new accounts versus existing account that is fundamentally how we break down. The business unit structure that you reference is on the product side of the house not on the sales side of the house, but what I did say earlier is that we are now starting to make the first steps in having some dedicated focus for product lines that we view as farther afield from our core selling motion. ITOM is not far afield from our core selling motion which is why we are not separating that out and it works very well for us there is no reason to change that. But on the security side customer service side as I said, we would like to see those pipelines grow faster and we think we are definitely going to achieve that with the dedicated sales focus. Steven Ashley : Perfect that's helpful, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair. Your line is open. Justin Furby : Thanks guys and congrats. I wanted to ask about bookings mix I guess if you were to look at new ACV come into door, it sounds like it was 16% from ITaap this quarter. I am wondering if you were add up the other areas like platforms, CX, CRC security, the other 9 ITSM products, are we at a point where it's 40% or more of new bookings and what did that maybe look like a year ago, I\u2019m curious what you think it looks like a year out from now? Thanks. Frank Slootman : This is Frank. It was actually about 30% and a year ago it was about 82% so that's the breakdown. Justin Furby : Sorry it was, say that one more time Frank. It was 82% a year ago of booking that came from non-ITSM or ITSM was 80%? Michael Scarpelli : ITSM was 82%, it was 70, service management is what we are saying and service management was 70% this quarter. Justin Furby : Versus 80 last Q1? Frank Slootman : 82% year end. Justin Furby : And if you look at a year from now what would be a guess of what you think it might look like just curious? Frank Slootman : Look we\u2019ve, by the way this starts to become just speculation to something great. But we think that by 2020 service management will end up being about half our business. We may be underestimating over estimating that but that's sort of an end state where we are envisioning at that. It's right where we are going, it could actually be less because emerging products are coming online a lot faster than we had anticipated. Justin Furby : Got it. And then if you think about geographies within those different products, are there any areas if you look at the US, is a much more of a propensity to sell other products or what does it look like across US, Europe and A-Pac in terms of penetration of those newer product? Thanks. Michael Scarpelli : They are more mature to market, they're more you see diversified selling take place. In markets that are less mature, the initial selling motion is always around surplus management because it's a well-worn path very well understood. So, the more mature then more penetrate, then more saturated, the more you see the diversified sales happening. Justin Furby : Got it. Thanks very much; appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. With respect to ITOM, what percentage of the sales force actually can sell ITOM and are you really comfortable that the end market is at the point where somebody that is used to buying ITSM or a sales person that's used to selling ITSM has made the appropriate contacts and introduction on to the IT operations set of house because in the large companies these two divisions can be completely separate. How comfortable are you that we're at the point where the market is able to buy this as a suite from one sales person with securing a combined quota from both of these products? Frank Slootman : Well it's Frank. Actually I don't think they are completely separate because the buying center is really fundamentally the same at the CIO level. It\u2019s one conversation and I can make that very apparent to you because even if you look at the legacy companies, they all have operations management and service management product portfolio and that's not by accident because there is very high leverage between these respected capabilities and the generation of software that we are working in now. That's very high degrees of automation. It is just essential that service and operational management, they're not just closed cousins, I mean, they're completely integrated in terms of work flow and processes. And everybody that we talked to is viewing service and operation management as bridges that they have to cross. It's \u2013 this is the reason why we are in the business. It's not optional for us to be in the operation management business because it's really two halves of the whole. That's probably the best way to say it. Kash Rangan : Would you get price, that last year results were great but we had a couple of quarters of good billings, some quarters of not as good billings. So, would you think that we are at the point where ITOM ITSM sales cycles too. We're converting. Sales force says better shot at producing deals that we don\u2019t have to worry about the traditionally tough quarter consistencies in terms of billings. Frank Slootman : You know what? We got a pay to worry about tough quarters. It's a hard fight out there, we take nothing for granted. We are pleased with the strength that we saw here but we are on the next quarter. These things are customers, they make major commitments. It's not just that they pay a lot of money. They also go through gut wrenching reimplementations, redeployments, big change in their infrastructure. They can't always chew that off. They sometimes have to push that out. So, this is a real world marketplace, right? This is not Facebook signing up another million users. This is a real enterprise business. Kash Rangan : Got it. Frank, why would you not raise your sales hiring plans given the success of the quarter? That's it from me, thank you. Frank Slootman : We are hiring staffs as we know how to do it in productive fashion. By the way, sales productivity is what we use as our guide to determine whether we are hiring faster or slower. We are always trying to drive sales productivity down because if it's going up, that means we are not hiring fast enough. So, that's how we determine the pace and how we follow the rate at which we bring people in. If you hire too fast you are going to get unwanted attrition, you start tracking really unhealthy dynamics. So, we are always sort of walking that fine line between the little too much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Greg McDowell : Great, thank you. One quick question about the traction around customer service management. You mentioned some wins in the Global 2000. I was just hoping you could give us some color on what those deals typically look like, are they green field opportunities, replacement opportunities, how competitive are those deals? And maybe a second part of that question is how should we think about the initial ASP of customer service management versus the initial ASP of your traditional ITSM stuff? Thanks. Frank Slootman : Yes, it's Frank. It's been a really interesting couple of months for us to sort of see the initial transactions take place. Our positioning irrelative to customer service is different from the traditional CRM approach that you might get from Deluxe of Oracle and sales force. Because we are going out with the service model as it has been defined and pioneered and matured on the IT side and it's a holistic model because it doesn't just care about the engagement model with the customer but it also cares about root cause analysis which is the engineering vector. And it cares about operations. You know, like how do I change the product or service to make sure that it's higher quality and these people do not keep calling me with the same set of issues and request. Now the IT customer understands this almost innately and intuitively, that's what we take advantage of and we really deal with people that have an intuitive understanding of why this service model makes sense and the more the service model looks like what they deal with in an IT organization the more people will come to the realization that this is the way to do it. So, the initial transaction we've done is there has been very strong conviction on the part of our customers that the model, the philosophy the way we do this is has really been the driver. All the other stuff, the online channel engagement, that's sort of table sticks. Everybody does that. But when you look at the service model, it's a very different offering. So, we are not to showing up with me too offering, we have a very different approach to coming into this marketplace. Greg McDowell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Philip Winslow : Thanks guys. This is actually Michael Turits that join for Phil. I was hoping you could dig in a little bit into the process of shifting some of the sales force to self-dedicated products rather than kind of the whole suite at once. Are these going to be kind of new hires coming into to do this? Are you going to repurchase part of the existing sales force and can you give us just sort of a general timeline for when you expect this to be implemented? Thanks. Frank Slootman : So, this is another one time thing. This is something that will start happening on an ongoing basis. We are going to start off at a modest level, is probably couple of dozen people involved and certainly in the coming quarter that are going to get this kind of a sales dedicated focus. It may involve existing people. It will surely involve new people. But that's up to the sales organization to decide how and where and who they are going to deploy against these opportunities. This is just a beginning. We are going to learn. We are going to see what works. We are going to do some more of that. What doesn't work, we'll back out. So, this is just a beginning of a journey. Not a one-time structural change and it will be all set and done. So, stay tuned. Michael Scarpelli : And to be clear too, the cost associated with this are factored into our full-year guidance for our operating margin already. Philip Winslow : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald from Wunderlich Securities. Your line is open. Ryan MacDonald : Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly digging a little bit more into the headcount, I think you said earlier that you are expecting to hire a 1000 people net new employees for the year. Can you talk about what segments of the market or specific geographies that you will be focusing on with that expansion? Michael Scarpelli : Well, those people predominately go into sales and marketing and then R&D. The R&D people observe with most of those are going in North America, we are starting to add more people into India, as well as our R&D facilities in Europe and Israel. The sales and marketing it is skewed more towards as a percentage growth of people in our Asia-Pacific and AMEA. But in absolute the US market is still such a vast market. There is a lot more room to split territories here that there will be more of those in absolute going into North America. Ryan MacDonald : Okay. And just a quick just clarification on the new security and customer service. Customers that you wonder in the quarter. Are those completely new customer wins or are they upsells from existing customers? And what was the say competitive dynamics involved with those deals? Frank Slootman : No security site, I think they were all upsells. There really wasn't a competitive dynamic because this is something that customers want to deploy on the ServiceNow platform because it's not viewed as a standalone service. It has to take advantage of event management capabilities. CMDB, everything that's the collaboration kit bell, the notification, all that stuff plays into it. But on the customer service side, we've had some opportunities where these were not customers previously. So, those are some new logo, new land type of opportunities which has been interesting to see. It's early going, it's fairly a random in the sense that the patterns are not all crystallized at this point. Ryan MacDonald : All right. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of F. A Lima [ph] from East/west Securities. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you. Back in the cloud management space what are the key competitive you expect to see and how do you plan to differentiate world system? Also, based on your earlier comments it seems like it's at least a 2018 revenue event. Do you think you need to buy more technologies to round out the portfolio or will it be all organic development as part of the platforming? Frank Slootman : Well when it comes to cloud management, we acquire what we needed and everything else we are going to build. I mean an acquisition is not just about technology, it's also about the talent. And so we have this core group of people that has come into the company and we will extend that group of people to do what we need to do. In terms of competition, very early going but as you have noticed, there has been a bunch of acquisitions in these area. CISCO just bought a company. Oracle just bought a company. VMware has been the long standing player in this space. We believe that because of the ServiceNow platform, that this is not a standalone marketplace at all and we think that we come in with a very compelling advantage, a launch in this service from the ServiceNow platform because again this all runs through the catalog. It runs through all the orchestration capabilities, the way people consume IT as a service. The entire service experience around it like so many things they start off as one off standalone things and then people realize they are not separate assets. They are really show bizzes that operate in the broader framework. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : And with regards to your comment to buy that it's a 2018 revenue. As we mentioned, it is being re-platformed on our platform and we do two releases a year that should be in our April/May release. So, it will start having an impact on bookings in Q2 of 2017. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks, Mike. And any quick comments on the linearity during this first quarter or was it any different from the earlier first quarters? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : No, it was good. Was strong at the beginning and end March. On purpose we are pushing to get feels close sooner and but nothing unusual. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Breindel from Royal Capital. Your line is open. Jeremy Breindel : I was curious about the impact that FX has on the updated guidance in the quarter I think. To start the year you expected FX to have a negative impact from the topline. It sounds like that changed. So, can you tell us how that impacted the guidance? Michael Scarpelli : Well, for the year-over-year right now where we trade where we are. The average for Q1 of 2016 to the average for Q1 of 2015 was pretty consistent. Remember we traded about five different currencies. It is about 30% of our business that is foreign and as we're going right now we just we expect it's going to be similar. Jeremy Breindel : Got you. When you initially guided for revenue, I think you estimated FX would be like a certain headwind for the year. But I believe has that changed? Michael Scarpelli : I don't. I didn't, I give guidance based upon where we saw the average rate was at the beginning of the year and that has not changed that much from where it is today. Slightly up. Jeremy Breindel : Great. Because I thought you said it was $7 million headwind expected for 2016 but now it's not at zero? Michael Scarpelli : On 1.38 billion, that's not a very big number, it's roughly the same. Jeremy Breindel : Got you, okay. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our questions for today. So, I would like to turn the call back over to the management for the closing remarks. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investors section of our website. Thank you, for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference call. This now concludes the program. And you may all disconnect your telephone lines at this time. Everyone have a great day.",

These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Total revenues for the second quarter grew 38% year-over-year to $341 million driven by new customers, upsells to existing customers and a 97% renewal rate. We added 26 Global 2000 customers and we now have 272 customers paying us more than $1 million in ACV, a record increase in the quarter. While service management continues to be our principal selling motion and the main driver of these metrics, our emerging products are growing faster and capturing more net new ACV. Emerging products defined as, everything except ITSM, represented 40% of our net new ACV, up from 24% in Q2 2015. Additionally, 67% of our customers now license multiple products and 15 new deals of our top 20 new deals in the quarter included three or more products. IT Operations Management, or ITOM, continues to be our second largest product suite and represented 13% of our net new ACV, up from 10% in Q2 2015. One of the biggest trends we're seeing in ITOM is customers licensing multiple products instead of one-off products. 53% of ITOM net new ACV included product bundles and 28% included the entire suite. For example, we signed an $840,000 upsell to a state government that purchased the entire ITOM suite to improve governance, remediation and self service. Customer Service Management officially launched in May at Knowledge16. A 1,300 attendees participated and 14 break-out sessions dedicated to this new service. We now have 40 total customers, 30% of which are new to ServiceNow and 31% of which are Global 2000s. Customer Service Management also participates in broader transactions. For example, we signed a $500,000 deal as part of a larger $1.3 million upsell to a medical equipment company. The customer also integrated Field Service Management to drive down costs and improve service delivery. Security Operations also had another strong quarter. We landed 18 new customers, including nine Global 2000s and we landed our first net new ACV deal over $500,000. We now have 32 total customers since our December launch. In June, we acquired BrightPoint Security to accelerate our investment in security analysis and response. BrightPoint allows customers to prioritize security threats by analyzing external threat data and by showing threat indicators with industry peers. Customers then remediate security threats using our Security Operations' structured workflow. We expect to completely replatform BrightPoint by the first half of 2017. Q2 was our strongest quarter ever for our human resources solution in terms of new business. Average deal sizes for this product continued to increase and we're encouraged by the outlook for the rest of the year. The strong quarter was driven by a $1.4 million HR-led deal to a new public sector customer in Australia. User experience was critical to the HR buyer and we won against an incumbent solution and two additional competitors. Q2 strength was also driven by our annual users conference, Knowledge16. We set a new record with over 10,000 attendees, an increase of 31% from the prior year. Knowledge is our single largest customer prospecting event of the year and 87% of attendees were customers, prospects, partners. We continue to branch out beyond the boundaries of IT as 24% of attendees were in roles outside of IT compared to 10% last year. In conjunction with Knowledge16, we hosted our second annual developer conference, CreatorCon. We saw 3,000 registered developers and application architects and hosted 51 workshop sessions, both an increase of more than 100% from last year. We expect significant growth next year as 94% of attendees indicated they will attend Knowledge17 in Orlando. Finally, we are announcing that our founder, Fred Luddy, intends to retire from active duty before the end of the year. Fred has been writing code for some 44 years and 13 whirlwind years at ServiceNow. We are thankful for his many contributions, as without him we would not be here today. Fred will continue to serve in an advisory capacity as well as on our board of directors going forward. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you, Frank. During today's call we will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q3 and full year 2016. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. Total revenues for the second quarter were $341 million, increasing 38% year-over-year. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not significantly impact our actual year-over-year revenue or billings growth. Subscription revenues were $291 million, increasing 45% year-over-year and professional services and other revenues were $51 million, increasing 9% year-over-year. Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells and renewals were 30.8 months, 27.5 months and 26.2 months respectively. Total revenues based on geography were $234 million in North America, $82 million in EMEA and $25 million in Asia-Pacific and other, representing 69%, 24% and 7% of total revenues respectively. Approximately, 30% of our revenue is in foreign currencies. The majority of our foreign exchange rate exposure is related to euro, however, we have approximately 6% revenue exposure to the British pound. Billings were $375 million in the quarter, increasing 33% year-over-year. Subscription billings were $333 million, increasing 38% year-over-year and professional services and other billings were $42 million, increasing 4% year-over-year. Our average billings duration was 11.8 months for the second quarter compared to 12.2 months in the same period last year, a negative impact of $12 million year-over-year. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 84% compared to 82% in the prior year. Professional services and other gross margin was 33% compared to 38% in the prior year. This includes $13 million of revenue related to our Knowledge Conference, while all related expenses run through sales and marketing. Excluding Knowledge revenue, our professional services and other gross margin was 10% compared to 19% in the prior year. Overall gross margin was 76% compared to 74% in the prior year. Excluding Knowledge revenue, overall gross margin was 76% compared to 72% in the prior year. Operating margin was 10% compared to 7% in the prior year, including net expenses of $11 million related to Knowledge. Our operating margin included higher than expected subscription revenue and lower than expected net expenses from Knowledge. We ended the quarter with 4,241 total employees, a net increase of 250 in the quarter. Net income for the second quarter was $26 million or $0.16 per basic share and $0.15 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $7 million or $0.05 per basic share and $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 164 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 173 million. Free cash flow margin was 23% compared to 26% in the prior year and we ended the quarter with $1.031 billion in cash, short term and long-term investments. Let's turn to guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016. Based on foreign exchange rates at the end of the second quarter, we are not forecasting a significant impact to our year-over-year revenue or billings growth due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues between $350 million and $354 million, representing year-over-year growth between 34% and 36%. Our guidance was negatively impacted by approximately $2 million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We expect subscription revenues between $312 million and $315 million, representing year-over-year growth between 40% and 41% and professional services and other revenues between $38 million and $39 million, representing year-over-year growth between 0% and 3%. We expect billings between $380 million and $385 million, representing year-over-year growth between 33% and 34%. Our guidance was negatively impacted by approximately $3 million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We expect subscription billings between $339 million and $343 million, representing year-over-year growth between 38% and 39%, in line with the growth rate we saw in the same period last year. We expect professional services and other billings between $41 million and $42 million, representing year-over-year growth between 2% and 4%. Turning to gross margins, we expect subscription gross margins of approximately 84%, professional service and other gross margins of approximately 13% and overall gross margins of approximately 76%. We expect an operating margin of approximately 15% and free cash flow margin of approximately 16%. As a reminder, Q3 is seasonally low for free cash flow as we expect to spend approximately $15 million associated with our ESPP purchase. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 174 million. For full year 2016, we expect total revenues between $1.37 billion and $1.38 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 36% and 37%. Our guidance for the rest of the year was negatively impacted by approximately $4 million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We expect subscription revenues between $1.203 billion and $1.211 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 42% and 43% and professional services and other revenues between $167 million and $169 million, representing year-over-year growth between 6% and 8%. We expect total billings of between $1.605 billion and $1.615 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 34%. Our guidance for the rest of the year was negatively impacted by approximately $6 million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We expect subscription billings between $1.427 billion and $1.435 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 37% and 38% and professional services and other billings between $178 million and $180 million, representing year-over-year growth between 9% and 10%. Looking at operating margin and free cash flow guidance. We expect to accelerate investments in sales and R&D in the second half of the year, but we are maintaining our guidance of approximately 12% and 24% respectively. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 173 million for the year and we expect to add approximately 1,000 net employees in 2016. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe to start with, it sounds like FX didn't have a big impact on your numbers here. I'm curious there was no mention of the macros given the timing of Brexit. Was there any impact to quarterly linearity or any thoughts on that, the potential impact on that, on the guide? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: No. We really haven't seen anything as a result of Brexit and coming into this quarter right now, too, we don't see any impact on our business today, but I think it's too early to tell. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And that's great. And then, Frank, maybe you highlighted in your prepared remarks this is a record quarter for HR deals. Are we closer to inflection point there on adoption? And I think at the conference you mentioned that 40% of your business is partner influence. Are you getting additional leverage there on some of these HR wins? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: No. I think that we're \u2013 I don't know whether it's an inflection point or not, we probably need a quarter or more to see how that plays out. But what we're seeing in all our emerging product lines is that the sustained focus and investment that we're making is really starting to push us over the edge as you know, or you may recall that about a year-and-a-half ago, we really changed our organizational model, how we build, how we support, how we go to market is really by product line now. And it just takes time for us to sort of reach critical mass there and there's a sort of a tipping point where things really come together on a lot of different vectors and we're starting to see the effects of that. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would add that to that $1.4 million HR deal was actually through Capgemini. So we are seeing the big system integrators involved in those. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your question please. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Mike, I realize that billings is not the only metric health but given kind of the decel you saw from Q1 to Q3 on the billings growth, can you maybe just reconcile for everyone what's happening there? And I know you don't give out the booking number, but is there anymore color that you could just add to what is just a number of, one of many numbers we see but certainly a focus for the Street. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, I just want to remind people that one of the biggest components of billings is actually the renewals that happens in the quarter. And so, the timing of renewals has a big impact, let me give you an example. There was a few big renewals that didn't get signed until the first day of this quarter that really should have happened last quarter that impacted our billings and there was quite a bit that dollar magnitude of that. And I also want to remind people, too, that why Q1 in our business is relatively big relative to other companies is we do have this phenomena when a lot of our contracts start January 1; even though we booked the deals in Q4, we grossed down that AR and deferred revenue and recognize that in Q1. That artificially inflates the Q1 billings when you look at it that way when you try to compare us with other companies. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And for Frank, with Fred's departure, obviously some big shoes to fill, I realize he is going to stay on the board and continue in an advisory role, but can you maybe just talk a little bit about who will back-fill as a leader for the product group? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, Fred's not a guy that can really be replaced. He's one of a kind and the company obviously has grown up around him over the last five years. When I joined we got about 250 people here, we're now at whatever we are, 4,300. So, there's a ton of talent. Over the years, we have definitely sort of enabled Fred to sort of scale back his day to day because he's been doing some heavy lifting for a very long time. So, we're actually thankful that we've had him as long as we've had him and we're really able to take this in stride. There's a lot of talented people at ServiceNow, a lot of different product lines in our platform. And I think the difference is Fred will be around, he'll be in an advisory capacity. The only difference is he's not going to be riding coat day in, day out and I think he's earned that break. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your question please. Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI : Yes. Thanks very much. I guess first, Frank, you saw actually a really nice jump in sort of that other category in terms of the bookings contribution. And I assume most of that contribution is coming from some of the HR and the Customer Service Management modules that you're offering that you've been talking about earlier in the call. I guess was there anything else in that bucket that we should be aware of that contributed this quarter? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: It was actually strong across the board. We highlighted HR but we highlighted Security, we highlighted Customer Service Management, but one area that was particularly strong was the whole Business Management area, where we do Project Portfolio management, combined with financials, combined with analytics. They had an exceptional strong quarter as well. So, it was very much across the board versus having one outlier. So, the bigger theme here is that the model is working really well for us the way we built go-to market. Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then just one quick one for Mike, obviously the third quarter for you guys is a big quarter in the federal vertical. I guess do you feel like the setup for that is still pretty healthy heading into this quarter in terms of just pipeline, what you're seeing in the pipeline, just normal build into the end of their fiscal year? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would just say, in general, we feel very good about the third quarter where we are sitting today and looking at the pipeline across the board, not just federal. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your question please. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Securities : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions, Frank and Mike. Frank, maybe you could start by talking a little bit about the deal mix in the quarter and particularly I'm wondering about new customers and where they're landing. So, in ITSM and expanding into ITOM or HR services, are you landing any clients with automation beyond IT? I saw one of the top 20 appears to be landed outside of ITSM and was looking for some color beyond the top 20 deals. And then, Mike, another question for you, maybe you can address a little bit where you're expanding partnering in Security Operations and what's driving the traction there with five of the top 20 deals, including Security Operations. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: I'll go first. It's Frank, Sarah. So, in terms of how we land, the preponderance of deals we're landing with Service Management has always been true. It is still true. The vast majority of our top transactions, ITSM, Service Management is core. That said, we have a lot more clubs in the bag now and our sales team is capable of landing with other products and I highlighted that in the prepared remarks that we have a whole bunch of brand new logos now, for example on customer service that are not ITSM customers. So, this ability to land with different products \u2013 I mean, different accounts is a very powerful new dynamic for the customer because we have demonstrated historically that we're very good at upselling customers once we land them. We just have many more opportunities to land them. We think that our overall performance in landing Global 2000 accounts was definitely boosted by having this portfolio of products. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, Sarah, I apologize. I didn't quite understand your question you were asking on the security side, the partners. Could you maybe clarify that question? Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Securities : Yeah. On the security \u2013 thanks, Mike, on the Security Operations side, I know you've announced several partnerships. I was wondering are those really what's driving uptake? Where are you getting some traction? It was pretty remarkable to see five of the top 20 deals including that Securities Operations. And I thought that the sales team was relatively new, so I was just looking for some more color around this. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sarah, it's Frank again. Security, I think most people don't realize but this is really a very close adjacency to our core business and it is very typical that, CSOs, Chief Security Officers report to CIOs. Many, many times when we host large customers here at our executive briefing centers, the CSO is there. We often now these days we're actually making sure that we invite CSOs in, but the whole offering is about combine the IT and security teams into a single system, single work flow, single set of analytics and so on. So, this is actually \u2013 this is not a completely separate market if you will where we sort of have to start up a whole new selling motion. This is actually very high leverage of our core business. We have very good access to this opportunity. So, there's a lot of exciting aspects to that business and that's why we're also making acquisitions in this space. We think it's going to be a very strong business for us over time. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Securities : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just wanted to thank you guys for taking the question and nice quarter. Wanted to sort of feel you guys out in terms of what gives you confidence in the guidance in the back half of the year. When I look at Q3, at the high end of the guidance range it looks like you're seeing accelerating billings growth. We all see stuff like Brexit because we get worried on our side of the fence. Where do you guys garner the confidence that you could actually see growth improve as you go into Q3 potentially at the high-end of that guidance range? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So I'll reiterate, from a billings perspective that you're looking at, the bulk of our billings is already contracted either with our contracted backlog or renewals that we know we're going to get. Remember, we have very good visibility into our renewals because if a customer is going to get off of ServiceNow, it's something we know well in advance. Second thing is, is as I said, we're off to a very strong start to this quarter. We feel very good about what we're seeing in our pipeline that we're looking at our Q4 pipeline. Both our gross and weighted gives us that confidence. And I just want to remind you, too, this is not a short sales cycle. This is a very long sales cycle. We have very good visibility into deals. When we're selling into Global 2000, many times this is a two-plus year sale cycle into these large accounts. So that's what gives us the confidence in these deals. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then drilling in a little bit just on the commercial side of the business. You had a really nice quarter in terms of G2K added 26 customers. Last quarter we saw that commercial business firm up really well. How has that been trending or how did that trend in Q2? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Commercial business continues to be very strong for us. We have continued to do some $1 million-plus transactions in that space, so we're very pleased with what we're seeing, and we think it was definitely the right decision in 2015 to segment our sales force into commercial and enterprise. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your question please? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, I guess I don't feel bad with Turits as it was Keith Weiss a minute ago. So hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. In any case, on the slipped deals, the slipped renewals, I just wanted to clarify, Mike. Did they all get signed, already the ones that slipped? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And is there any reason? Was it execution, longer sales cycles, anything we should worry ourselves about? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Once again, these were renewals that were supposed to have renewed right at the end of the quarter, and it was delays in procurement organizations who tried to renegotiate deals many times, but they've all been signed already. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And then also... Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Just to be clear, this happens every quarter. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Go ahead... Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: There's deals that get pushed and pulled every quarter on the renewal side. I would say this quarter they tended to be more that got pushed. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And that leads into why you have more confidence or strong confidence in this Q as well, right, on the billing side? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I'll just say, we're off to a very good start for Q3 right now where we're sitting today. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And then my follow up is on fed. I can't remember if Kirk mentioned this or not. I think he brought up fed next quarter, but you got FedRAMP certification. Does that increase your confidence, your opportunity pipe likely to convert as you go into 3Q? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank, Michael. We're not fixated on our federal business as the driver of our Q3 number. Mike's already said several times, we're off to a very, very fast start, and we have tremendous visibility in this quarter. That's really what gives us the confidence in the federal business is part and parcel of that overall view of the business. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I just wanted to return to the new ACV mix data. Obviously, phenomenal growth in the other category. But at the risk of looking at the glass half empty, I want to look at the service management piece. 76% a year ago, it's now 60%. Mike, did that grow in terms of new ACV dollars? And could you just update us on how you feel about that core service management piece in terms of new ACV? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So I'm not going to talk about growth in ACV with service management, but what I will say and what Frank said before, if you just look at our 26 Global 2000, 24 of those were they started with ITSM. That is what lands us in the door. It is still the bulk of our revenue and will continue to be the bulk of our revenue for quite some time and it will continue to grow in our revenue. And so that business is still very strong. The fact of the matter is these new emerging products are growing faster because they're off a such smaller base. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, makes sense. Okay. Thank you, Mike, for that. And if I could ask a follow up. Your margin guidance for 3Q and the full-year implies that we might see flat or slightly down margins in 4Q. And I think you touched on it, you mentioned an increase in investment in sales and R&D. Could you elaborate a little bit on where the investment focus is? Thanks a lot. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sure. So, as you know, we've been acquiring companies. For instance, we bought ITapp on the ITOM side. We just bought BrightPoint this quarter. We're making some additional investments in R&D and our core ITSM products. And so we're accelerating R&D hiring and also we're pulling forward, especially around some of these new products and specialty sales from Q4 into Q3. So it's not changing the overall year, but it changes the timing of some of our salespeople as well, too, because of the opportunity we're seeing in some of these newer emerging products. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Good. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your question please. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Terrific. I would just like to ask about the ITOM business and specifically what I'm going to refer to as new ITOM, which is ServiceWatch and Event Management and some of the newer things you're doing. Maybe you could comment on what kind of traction you're seeing with those newer products? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: We continue to do really, really well in that business. It is the second largest revenue stream and bookings opportunity that we have next to service management. It's still very new business to us. As we highlighted during the prepared remarks, the sales teams are really learning to sell the entire suite, the entire strategy. I think it's going really well. The harder part about ITOM for us is, is that from a deployment standpoint, in other words that is a very different motion than what we're used to on the service management side. That has certainly triggered some growing pains on the part of our organization to really become highly proficient on that. We made a lot of investment on the services side of our organization, and we actually think that represents opportunity and upside to us. I think we are getting way, way better at the deployment aspect of that business, which we think then in turn becomes an enabler for even better growth in that business. Because if you can't install rapidly, your follow-on deals obviously take longer. So ITOM is a different kind of a business, but because our core products have such strong value propositions, as you mentioned ServiceWatch, but it's really the entire way we do things with the CMDB being the core depository there has resonated very, very strongly. We just need to get better at rapidly deploying it, rapidly getting the customer to value and I think that will become a further enabler for growth in the ITOM opportunity. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your question please. Alex Zukin - Piper Jaffray Companies : Thanks for taking the question. Hey, guys. Frank, first for you. You mentioned you doubled your customer count basically on the customer service side sequentially. And I was curious how often you're seeing Salesforce, what your win rates are, and why typically you're getting chosen over them in these competitive engagements? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. So, obviously, we're still moving from a small base, but the response we have from the marketplace suggests that what we're doing is resonating. We're not at tit for tat with Salesforce. We really bring the holistic integrated service model to the customer, which really adds to the engagement model, to the engineering and root cause analysis aspect, to the change operational processes, all in one single integrated approach. For people that come from that world, which is typically the IT crowd, they go like, yes, that's the right way to do things. So we often get traction where that integrated holistic model is viewed as a really, really core advantage. So that doesn't apply to every single customer service opportunity, but in the world of IoT and expensive capital equipment type of service models, I think we have the right approach and we're seeing the traction. As you know, this is a very large business. It's probably the single largest market that we're operating in. So we can really invest in this area for a long time to come. We are replacing a lot of legacy systems, home grown systems. It's not that different in that regard from what we're doing on the service management side and the operations management side, very similar dynamic. We typically take up stuff that's very, very old. Alex Zukin - Piper Jaffray Companies : Got it. And then maybe one question, kind of the opposite question of what Keith was asking. If you look at your guidance for subscription billings for the year, any reason or maybe remind us why we should see the kind of growth deceleration in the 4Q period that's implied in the guidance. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: You're getting into the law of large numbers, Alex, and the guidance is what we think is appropriate right now. It's still quite substantial growth over 2015. Alex Zukin - Piper Jaffray Companies : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair. Your question please. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, Frank and Mike. I was just wondering if you could give more detail on what you saw by geography in terms of new bookings in the quarter. And, Frank, I think I've heard you talk about in 2020 that you expect something like 50/50 mix in terms of new ACV from ESM and non-ESM. And it seems like you might be tracking to get there sooner than you thought. And I'm just wondering if that's the case, how it impacts the model, if at all, in terms of margins or growth over the next four to five years. Thanks. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: It's Frank. I'll start. I think you're correct. We're facing at least \u2013 if you meant to imply that \u2013 we are pacing a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be, but that doesn't mean that it will continue at this blistering pace there sort of the mix substitution that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. I think we have so many irons in the fire now, we have a lot of hot products. There's just a ton of opportunity for us to prosecute and deploying the resources to be able to do that is really what we're focused on. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself of knowing exactly how that mix is going to play out here in subsequent quarters. We're just happy to be able to go to market with a lot of interesting value propositions that make a lot of sense together. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And I would just add, Justin, your question on the performance in different geos, EMEA and APAC had very strong quarters, about what we were expecting, and Americas came in pretty much where we were expecting, so. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just one more, if I may. I think in Europe I think you made some changes at the sales organization level over the last six to 12 months. I was just hoping you might be able to comment on what you're seeing from those changes. Thanks. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank. We actually made two major theatre leadership changes last year, this year both for the Americas as well as for Europe. And we believe there's been a very significant impact of that. One of the things we're super pleased about in 2016 is that the fidelity of forecasting, our sales organization's ability to guide the business has dramatically improved from 2015. And that is in no small parts because of the leadership changes that we've made. So we're feeling very good where we are and we're feeling very good at what we're looking at for the second half. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys. And congrats. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen & Co. Your question please. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Mike, great job on the subscription gross margins, but had a question on the services side. Looking at your Q3 guide, it looks like PS margins are going to be under some pressure. Is that due to just intentional slowdown on the services side? Or are there other factors at hand? And I guess with regards to your focus on driving more services from the channel, how has that been tracking relative to expectations? And what are some of the things you guys are doing to accelerate more enablement from your partners? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sure. So we've done a few changes within our professional service organization. A, we elevated the leadership to being a direct report into our CEO, Frank, so that it's outside of the sales organization. And we hired a real GSI leader in to run that organization who just started in the last three months. He's making some changes in that organization, and we're working through the transition of that right now, but I feel very good. We're going to have more of a global delivery model for our professional service organization. But with that I just want to remind you, we try to have most of the services delivered by our partners. We're really focused more on new \u2013 as we have our emerging products, we have to be the one delivering those implementations, because our partners don't know how to do them yet. Once our partners get up and running and trained, we expect they'll do more, and we're pleased with what we're seeing with the amount of business our partners are taking on. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And if I could throw one in there, given the settlement with BMC, any change in terms of velocity of win rates or sales cycles? Or would you consider it to be immaterial in terms of what you're seeing in the field? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank. No real change there. Nothing that we want to attribute to that. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your question please? Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Frank, I'm wondering if you could talk about sales productivity generally? And you talked about accelerating some sales investments. It sounds like that's more of a shifting around. But could you comment on sales productivity and how it's fairing versus a year ago? And especially as you look towards the second half of the year, where you expect to see things accelerate? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. I think you've heard me say this in prior quarters. When sales productivity is where we like it, we tend to accelerate hiring, and when it's not where we like it, we tend to take our foot off the pedal. And since we are moving hiring up in the year, it's a clear indication that we're happy with the way things are going and the opportunity that we think our reps are having. And the big thing about hiring and productivity is that we hire people, we've got to see our way clear that these people become productive because then we all start making money and the whole scheme works for us. So feeling good where productivity is at and we're feeling even better of what we think we can do for the balance of the year. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then, Mike, on the deal slippage on the renewals, it sounds like those are closed. But how are you treating those in your forecast? I guess, we haven't heard actual renewal slipping impacting your forecast. It seems like that's more been of a new business thing. And were those sort of very much one-off events, or were those the types of things that you see normally and you just saw more of it? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, first of all, the renewals and these things slipping one day have virtually no impact on revenue at all. The only thing they have is an impact on is billings, and as renewals become a bigger portion of our overall business, we're at the stage now where renewals is bigger than what our net new ACV we sign in a year. This is the transition year right now that will have a bigger impact on billings, because if it slips from June 30 to July 1, we don't get that billing. So, yes, it was a pretty big number. We saw that slip. But as I said earlier, this has happened all the time. We're always pulling renewals in and renewals get pushed out. It's just this quarter it tended to be a little bit bigger with a couple big ones. Usually they're smaller deals. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: They are signed as of today. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. Your question please. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You guys have been running well ahead on new customer acquisition at Global 2000. I think you laid out a goal of 18 per quarter. Obviously ahead of it this quarter, but hadn't been for some time. So what are the potential impacts on the model? Does this give you confidence you can start to drive upside? Are these deals typically the same size they have been, or are you seeing customers take down I guess smaller chunks upfront with higher renewals as they come back? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So a lot of the Global 2000 that we added, we added is I think about eight of them were in APJ this quarter, and I expect that more as a percent will be in APJ because that's probably the one area where we're the most underpenetrated and we're relatively new into that market. A lot of APJ deals start out low, but I just want to remind you some of our biggest accounts like GE, I think they started out at 80,000 a year. So it's not uncommon for customers to start small and then they grow. Just look at our cohort analysis slide that we put in our investor deck again. That continues to be the case that once a customer buys, they very quickly grow. And so for us, it's all about quality of customers we land, and we think all those Global 2000 that bought this quarter are going to grow to be substantial customers. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.: Second on the security office front, who are you replacing as you're going in? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank, Rob. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.: Hi, Frank. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: No, we're replacing people staring at spreadsheets all day long. There's nothing there. It is the most amazing thing that in a world of cyber security, there's been so much focus, so much investment, on enforcement, on vulnerability scanning, on detection, and then what happens in the back end in terms of the analysis and response. It's a complete dearth of solutions. And those teams, they're in typically the SOCs, the Security Operations Center, being completely separate from the NOC, Network Operations Center, where the IT guys live. The immaturity of how people respond is just incredible. And this is what presents us with this extraordinary opportunity. And because security lives so close to IT, it doesn't take people very long to recognize the significance of what we're bringing to the security equation. That's where our excitement comes from, it's a not a replacement market, it's the reality is there's nothing there, and I think everybody knows that we're pretty damn good in terms of detection, and validating threats, and all of that kind of stuff. Our ability to filter signal out of noise is incredibly impaired in a world of security. And it's done by people right now, rather than by systems, and the ability to execute on the workflow, is what comes after that. Now this is really a whole back end of the cybersecurity workflow that we are addressing and investing in. And we think this is going to become a major, major market. It is inevitable, somebody's going to get it, and it might as well be us. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.: Thanks, Frank. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your question please. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you very much. If you look at the deals that slipped, Mike, not to press too much on this, but if you were to normalize it, do you think the subscription billings could have been materially higher, meaning, there was about 400 basis points of discrepancy between Q1 and Q2, do you think you could have grown your subscription billings at just about the same pace as you did in Q1, which is, I believe, about 41%, 42%, and I have a follow-up question. Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would say, I haven't calculated the percentages, but net-net, we probably had about $6 million that slipped from this quarter into next quarter. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And that, you can also look at it too, for full year billings, we did take $6 million out of our forecast for FX. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Correct, correct. Also you had the duration, which is about four months shorter, I believe, right? Actually, 0.4 months shorter per your calculation, 12.2 months to 11.8 months, and the other question was when you look at the percentage of new business that's coming in, ITOM seemed to have gone down a bit. I'm just wondering if the pipeline for ITOM has shifted into the second half of the year, how confident do you feel that this could come back and also more of a strategic longer \u2013 2017 question. Do you think your subscription billings growth rate is more of a reliable way to look at the growth rate of your business and then trying to help understand what could be the future growth rate of the company. Thank you very much. Because you know the professional services business particularly. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Okay. So answering your question about ITOM. We've mentioned before, and I can't stress enough, these are long sales cycles. We tend to do bigger deals in ITOM, and it's just a matter of the timing of deals. We feel very good about what we're seeing in our ITOM business. This quarter I think it's going to be a good ITOM quarter, and so we're not concerned there at all. In terms of what's a better proxy for estimating our growth, definitely subscription billings is a much better proxy, because the professional service, it's something we want to push more of that off to our partners rather than see that business grow. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Wonderful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your question please. Andrew Kisch - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys. This is Andrew Kisch on for Raimo. So obviously, as you said we're getting to pretty large numbers and we're seeing growth maybe start to slow a little bit, but with that in mind could you help us think through what you might do with the profitability and cash flow and operating margins? As that growth slows, I mean, this year we're still looking at about 150 basis point increase on cash flow margins, I'm just wondering what that might look like in the future. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So if you look at our Analyst Day deck that we put out, you will see there is the framework for growth rates and how that relates to operating margin expansion and cash flow margin expansion. You can go look at our website and you could see that in our investors' section. Clearly defines it, what we're seeing. Andrew Kisch - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Your question please. Brian Schwartz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just had one operational question, Frank, you talked a lot about the sales productivity trends that you're seeing that you're really happy with. Just wanted to ask about the hiring that you've done so far. And just wondered if you can provide an update on the progress year-to-date of onboarding the new sales hires versus your plans. Just wondering if you hit your target here through the first half of the year for your new sales rep hires. Thanks. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: We did good on hiring this quarter, attrition was also down, so I think the sales teams are where they like to be. As a result, Michael already highlighted as we're moving some of the hiring from Q4 to Q3. And obviously we're doing that with an eye towards 2017, as well as because we think we can take advantage of the opportunity. So, we're in a good place. Brian Schwartz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, guys. A question for Frank and then a quick follow up for Mike. Frank, it seems like a lot of the newer products which you're selling are kind of, I don't know if evangelical is the right word, but you're going after new budget or trying to create budget versus ITSM, which was more of a replacement cycle sale. How does that shift your selling approach, if it does? I was hoping you could walk us through that. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, that's actually for most of our products not the case, I mean as I said earlier, customer service we're always replacing something, the project management site, we're replacing something ITOM, we're definitely turning stuff off. So, the vast majority of times, we're turning stuff off. I think where you are correct is on the security side, having this kind of a structure workflow capability that is seamlessly integrated with the Palo Alto Networks and Splunks of the world. That is an awful idea if people have not done that before. That is a little bit more evangelical, that's the word that you used, but the good news here is it is incredibly evident to our customers that that is an idea whose time has come, and they need it in a hurry. Just the ability to be able to track and analyze security incidents is like a whole new deal to them. That's because security and IT have lived in separate spheres and we're busting through those walls and really letting security really benefit from everything that's been learned on the IT side. So for the most part, it is a replacement process which is a good sales motion to be in. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And Mike, I didn't see in your investor deck this quarter, your upsell rate disclosed. Was curious if you could provide that? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: We're not really talking about the upsell rate anymore, we really stopped doing that and the reason we're not doing that as we mentioned before, as our install base grows, upsells tends to be the bigger piece of our business than new customers. So, it's just not a metric that we're disclosing going forward. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your question please. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Mike, can you talk about penetration within the Global 2000 companies? What's the average ACV from that group? And how high can it go? And how high does it need to go for you to meet your 2020 target? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So our 2020 target was predicated on having 1000, Global 2000 at the end of 2020 and on average doing $2 million a year out of the Global 2000. You can see today where the number is \u2013 what's the actual number today, $941,000 on average we're getting out of the 681 Global 2000. So we feel very comfortable that we're tracking towards that target. How high can it be? We're forecasting it to be $2 million on average, but there's many customers, if you look now we have 272 customers. The bulk of those are Global 2000, but they're not all Global 2000. That on average \u2013 that pay us over $1 million, and on average they're paying us about $2.2 million a year right now. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So clearly it can be higher than $2 million. Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Wunderlich Securities. Your question please. Ryan MacDonald - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thanks guys. Frank, you talked earlier about the BrightPoint acquisition, and I believe that's going to be re-platformed, you said, by the first half of next year. Can you talk a little \u2013 go a little bit more into what's going to be involved with that re-platforming? And how BrightPoint is going to be enhancing the security operations offering as well? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. So re-platforming is something that we do with every assets that we require. At ServiceNow, we don't integrate acquisitions, we re-platform them. And what that means is we essentially take them apart and rebuild them on our cloud, on that platform. So it's really indistinguishable from something that we've built. This is really important, because we don't want to saddle our customers with a plethora of different assets that represents the patchwork that they have to keep operable. That's sort of the bane of software existence that people have lived with over the last 20 years, 30 years. So for us it's all one cloud. We make sure that it's all implemented the right way. And when you upgrade from one version to the next, you don't have to worry whether A works with B, with C and so on. So re-platforming is a really big commitment. It sometimes takes us a year and a year-and-a-half to do it, but we bite that bullet. And then when we get out there with the product exactly the way it needs to be, we only want to buy assets where the team that we're bringing on is really in full agreements with us that that is the right way to do it. Otherwise we wouldn't even want to proceed with the acquisition. So yeah, it's going to be somewhere in the first half of 2017. Hopefully there'll be in the earlier part of that, because that really triggers the beginning of the sales process. There's a lot of interest in the capabilities, also with ITapp, that's a deal that we did earlier this year, and then BrightPoint of course is such a natural draft on the security sales motion that we already have. So we're excited about these assets coming into our fold. Ryan MacDonald - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: And as you look at \u2013 just one quick follow-up. As you look at the other areas of, say, the emerging products, whether it be in customer service or in some of the business management areas or segments, is there any other pockets for additional M&A that you think that you'd be interested in, in terms of additional replatforms for small tuck-in acquisitions? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. I mean, we typically look at this in the context of all the business units that we have. Our business unit leaders, all have a list of assets that they're tracking, monitoring, trying to determine what the strategic imperative is. We have a whole bunch of other requirements when we have hot businesses like security, we're obviously going to be motivated to further enhance that, we also bring in talent that our hardcore security people, which is really what we want, what we need, because we're not a security company ourselves, we really have to build that up. The stronger our teams in these areas, the more confident and the more we want to support them when they want to do deals. So most of our M&A activity is going to be in the context of those individual opportunities. Ryan MacDonald - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Your question, please. Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Yeah, most of mine have been asked. But if we take a look at some of the newer applications in ITOM, normally those come as sales as upsells to your ITSM customers. Are you seeing any of those becoming the wedge or beginning to lead into an account, rather than following ITSM? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, we traditionally, I mean, as we said earlier, ITSM is almost always our beachhead, it's how we start the relationship. Not always, there are numerous exceptions to that as well, but the preponderance of evidence says that ITSM is how we land, and then we evolve from there. ITOM has so far been the most natural progression for customers once service management gets implemented. It requires a very solid implementation of the CMDB. Without a solid implementation of the CMDB, it's very difficult to really start on an ITOM journey, so these things all need to happen before sort of the next opportunity can be triggered and pursued. So I think \u2013 it does happen. You know that ITOM leads, but most of the time it's a natural progression from service management to implementation. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: The more common products that we see kind of leading potentially before ITSM is HR and customer service. We have examples of those already. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back to Michael Scarpelli for closing comments. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investors section of our website. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

As a reminder to our audience, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. Sir? [004ZLR-E Mike Scarpelli] Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our Chief Executive Officer.

I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us on today's call. We are pleased to announce an exceptional third quarter. Total revenues grew 37% year-on-year to $358 million driven by record metrics across-the-board. First, we closed 16 new deals with net new ACV greater than $1 million. Second, we posted a 99% renewal rate. Third, 301 customers now pay us more than $1 million in ACV, an increase of 31 in the quarter. And then lastly, 18 customers now pay us more than $5 million in ACV, an increase of six in the quarter. We also continue to see great uptick in Global 2000 accounts, adding 23 new logos in the quarter including Prada, Hilton, and Constellation brands. Our average ACV per Global 2000 is now approximately $1 million, a 6% sequential increase and a 20% year-over-year increase. Large deals in IT, emerging products, and the federal business highlighted the quarter. IT continues to be our strength and primary landing strategy. 18 of our top 20 deals and 22 of our 23 new Global 2000 logos included ITSM, and we see tremendous new business opportunities in this market. The quarter was punctuated by an upsell to a North American Global 100 financial institution. This represented our largest contract value ever and included more than $5 million in net new ACV. The CIO was tasked with driving significant cost savings, increasing employee productivity and improvement of velocity of service delivery. We successfully demonstrated a comprehensive service management solution and the ability to unify processes in a single system of engagement. The deal was led by ITSM to consolidate 66 disparate tools and augmented by ITOM to deliver lights-out automation. This initiative will result in more than a $115 million in savings over five years. Beyond IT, emerging products continue to drive larger deals as customers increase adoption of service management throughout the enterprise. These products represented 41% of our net new ACV in the quarter, up from 28% in the prior year. 15 of our top 20 deals included three or more products and 69% of our customers now license more than one product. Emerging products were highlighted by our largest HR deal ever, a $2 million upsell to a European Global 100 financial institution. As part of their global transformation, this customer is replacing a legacy solution that supported 19 disparate document management tools. We won this RFP against 10 other vendors with a comprehensive platform approach including case management, orchestration to integrate key systems and in-platform analytics. ServiceNow will improve employee engagement for more than 250,000 employees and deliver productivity for more than one million cases per year. We also saw large deals in industry verticals. The federal government represented 11% of our net new ACV compared to 9% a year-ago, including two new deals with ACV greater than $1 million. The civilian sector represented the majority of our wins, the defense net new ACV grew 40% year-on-year and represents a large opportunity going forward. We landed our largest federal deal ever, a $2 million up-sell to an agency within the department of health and human services. This customer contracted ITSM to consolidate 10 legacy systems, performance analytics to gain insight into key trends and discovery to effectively manage assets. Additionally, our FedRAMP certification, led to us becoming the first enterprise-wide cloud platform. Finally, our Chairman, Paul Barber of JMI is retiring from our board of directors after 11 years of service. Paul was our first venture investor, and we appreciate his support all these years. Going forward, I will serve as Chairman and Charlie Giancarlo will serve as Lead Independent Director. We also welcome two new members to our board, Jonathan Chadwick, most recently CFO of VMware; and Paul Chamberlain, most recently Head of Technology and Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley. Both bring significant corporate leadership, industry and management experience to our board. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you, Frank. During today's call, we will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q4 and full year 2016.

With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We ask everyone today participating in today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to one preliminary question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Question please. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter. Love to see the billings accelerate, also the non-ITSM business continues to do extremely well. Mike, I know on the last call you guys talked about accelerating some hiring plans, starting earlier in Q3. I think you were speaking to really the pipeline that you're seeing in non-ITSM deals as you look out into 2017. I think the mix certainly improved this quarter to non-ITSM deals. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the benefits of some of that hiring? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: We're seeing the generation of pipeline and we're very pleased with the pipeline. We see, not just in Q4, but how it's building in 2017 right now. And we think those were very good investments. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And, then one question. I don't think we've touched on this on the \u2013 in the Q&A section in a while. But in terms of the ServiceNow Store, I'm curious, is there any update on the number of developers or apps, number of customers deploying third-party apps, just sort of curious on that initiative? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: That's not really a key metric that I've been looking at because it's not a big piece of our business. As we said before, the ServiceNow Store, what it really does is it drives more user licenses, not necessarily revenue coming from the app themselves, but we have about 56,000 developers in our developer program. Obviously, not all of those have posted things to our App Store. There is \u2013 I think a little over 200 apps that you can now download for purchase in our App Store. We did do three deals that were just over $0.5 million in the quarter. Our biggest one, we talked about before, we did do a $1 million deal in the past, but this past quarter there were just three. So as you can see, it's not that big a piece of our business. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your questions please. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Frank, can you just talk a little bit about the commercial business versus the enterprise business and what you're seeing in that business? And I have a quick follow-up for Mike. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. The commercial business is actually on an ACV basis, the fastest growing business that we have worldwide. It was growing \u2013 it was up I think somewhere around 44% and in the North American organization it was like close to 70%. So the investment that we made almost two years ago to create a dedicated commercial sales organization has paid off in spades for us and we will continue to invest there. It's an outstanding market. So that balance that we have between commercial and enterprise is really a very key part that drives the overall growth of the company. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And Mike, just in terms of the price comments about financial services upsell, it sounds like there were some really large deals. Can you just give us a sense of kind of how you're thinking about that as you go into Q4 in the pipeline? I think many of us believe that financial services may have been not quite as (13:53) strong as it was, but maybe I'm reading too deeply into that. Can you just give us a little more color there? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Financial services was very strong for us. We actually did one of our largest HR deal ever, $2 million a year and that was with a financial service company and we continue to do a number of up-sells. In our pipeline in Q4, we continue to see more in there as well \u2013 as well as our pipeline for 2017. So, we just have strength across-the-board. We really feel we're hitting on all cylinders across all of our product lines right now. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your questions, please. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Mike, I guess, just maybe to follow-up on your comment around the HR deal, it sounds a (14:38) financial services customer. Obviously, the other products continue to really expand as a percentage of new ACV. Can you just talk about what was in there may be driving some of the strength this quarter, or Frank, if you want to take it? In addition maybe the HR platform, I had imagined, is a pretty good product for the government in particular. Can you just give a little bit more color on some of the other products outside of ITSM \u2013 sorry, ITOM, sorry? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. So, like Mike said, we had strength across the board. So, we had a very strong quarter on performance analytics. We had a record quarter on human resources. Our brand new businesses around security and customer service management were really, really strong. Platform was strong as well. So, there literally was no \u2013 we just did really well across our theatres, across our channels and across all our product segments and that's when you get very strong results. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : And maybe one follow up from Mike \u2013 just Mike, when you look at sort of sales productivity year-to-date versus kind of what you're thinking at the start of the year. Are you sort of on plan in that respect or you're a little bit ahead of plan, it seems like the cross-selling is going really well. So, I was just kind of curious how that's evolving today? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I'll just say through the first nine months we're well ahead of our internal plan in terms of bookings and we're very pleased with that, and that's reflected in the productivity per rep that we're seeing. So, I don't think we could be happier there. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your questions please. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Mike, I'm wondering if you could talk about, just as we look at next year seasonality, I think it's been somewhat tricky sometimes Q4, Q1 and Q2. If you could just help us understand how you might be thinking about that and is that similar to what it's been in past years or is there anything new going on? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: The seasonality is really from the billings perspective is what you really see and that's because we have such a big gross down at the end of a quarter and especially Q4. So you don't see the seasonality as much in billing. But as we get bigger, you will see some seasonality going from Q4 to Q1. So obviously, Q4 is our biggest quarter with our end of our commission year for our reps and they try to do everything they can to close every deal so, I don't expect anything different this quarter. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then, just relative to sort of the sales organization going into next year, can you talk about any changes that you may be looking at making? Or how should we think about, in years you've done that, there has been more impact on seasonality, for example in Q4 billings? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: So sales \u2013 this is Frank, Walter. The sales organization is going to be rapidly expanding, and one of the areas that we've been investing in is product specialization, which is working well for us. We're really accelerating demand generation by having that product specialization focus into the organization. But going into 2017, we are going to layer in another vector specialization that's going to be by solution and by industry verticals. So this is going to be an evolution of our selling motion that's going to be more refined by industry and by type of solution. So it's really a normal evolution. We're becoming just more sophisticated in our ability to sell more broadly and more deeply into our large enterprises and institutions. So that's definitely how the sales organization is going to take shape in 2017. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your questions please. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, it's Michael Turits. Thanks. Frank, can \u2013 you gave a little bit \u2013 drilled down on the non-ITOM, non- ITSM piece. Can you drill down a little bit more on the ITOM piece? What were the use cases? Are they broadening and deepening? And maybe Mike, if you could talk about what the ACV is doing on a year-over-year basis for growth? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. This is Frank. On the ITOM side, we very much lead with a \u2013 with a very comprehensive total suite approach to allow our customers a full cycle experience where we can take in events from various monitoring capabilities, map that to critical services, and have the ability to \u2013 through orchestration to act on those events. ServiceWatch, which is the ability to dynamically map infrastructure to critical services is a key part of our strategy. That's how we lead and that's going to continue for one period of time because this is a marketplace that is yet to begin to develop for us. And then the other aspect, orchestration is going to be a very big part going forward. And it's under the influence of, really IoT oriented thinking, where people are really looking at service models in terms of machine-to-machine messaging and communications versus heavily people-mediated service processes. And obviously the orchestration aspect is what drives various frameworks. So those are the areas that where a lot of our conversations with our large customers are going. But ITOM is such a natural partner to ITSM, they are just two peas in a pod, two sides of a same coin. So we really believe that overtime, the penetration that you'll see on ITOM will rival that of what we have on ITSM. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And your question with regards to the growth of net new ACV, we're really not disclosing net new ACVs, so we're not going to give you the overall growth. As you can see our business has been very strong and is reflected in our billing, and that's what's causing the billing speed. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your questions please. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, guys, hi. Can you hear me? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right, great. Hi Frank and Mike. Couple of questions for you guys. Congrats on the quarter too. First, what's really the CapEx spend right now, Mike? And Frank, one for you also. So it looks like we're seeing some really nice adoption of the 30 operations modules, been for \u2013 roughly four logos or five logos for the past couple quarters and a relatively new product. It sounds like the pipeline is strong there, and it certainly backs what we're hearing. And I know you talked about it briefly at the Analyst Day, but are you going to think about having an independent sales force behind this product, given the seesaw selling there motion and this interest from customers? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, on the CapEx, I'll answer that question, first. Obviously, there is two components to our CapEx. The biggest component is our data centers. As you add more customers, you have to add more capacity within your data centers. We're also building out two new data centers because we're in North America, which is a thing that will take some time. That's been planned for quite a while as we're at capacity in our other data centers. The other thing as you are adding a 1,000 employees a year, that takes facilities, and we're building facilities, but the vast majority is hardware within our data centers and you do have to refresh that equipment every three years, and we're into our normal refresh as well there. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank, Sarah. The security has been strong for all the reasons that were mentioned, it's a very logical add-on. Typically the Chief Security Officer reports into the CIO. They're often in the same meetings that we're in anyway, so it's a very natural selling motion for us. But we did start a quarter ago with really loading in dedicated field head count, both for security as well as for customer service management. And the reason we're doing that is because we're going to drive demand faster than if we just have rest of us (23:02) choosing to retire anyway they see fit. And we have the evidence now that that strategy is building demand faster than if we stay in the generalized mode. So we will continue to do that. It doesn't mean that there is just one group that just sells security when your overall sales force obviously will sell it as well. We just have more dedicated focus on these products and especially in the early going we thought it's really important that we have that extra level of resource and focus applied to it. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Right. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. Your questions, please. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : Great. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to reflect more broadly on the inflection you guys saw here in the quarter, and is that just a function of how the pipeline stacked up or sales cycles compressing at this point? Just curious as you saw your billings, your subscription billings everything accelerate sequentially. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Rob, it's Frank. What's really going on here is that our sales staff worldwide just has more clubs in the bag. So as they approach accounts, they have more opportunities to pursue and they can really \u2013 and sometimes multiple opportunities at the same time. So the acceleration really comes from being able to operate on a broader product front. In years past, if we would strike out of one area, we would have to go to another account or wait out the situation or whatever it would be. Now, we have a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth play to go and pursue. Once we land an account, then the upsell opportunity starts playing out for us as well. So it's that productivity really goes up when you have the ability to run multiple plays. And so we have a much broader selling motion than we've ever had before, and that's what's driving it. Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : And then with regard to your Global 2000 penetration, you've talked about how you're in the early innings especially with regard to international opportunities. Talk about some of the infrastructure that's in place to help capture those deals? Because we haven't seen a huge mix shift, I guess, towards revenue internationally. I think it's been relatively consistent international versus domestic. So, as we look forward, where should our expectations be? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I'll say one thing Rob. Last quarter, 32% of our net new ACV came internationally, and remember international has been suffering from the FX over the last year plus. So, I do \u2013 we are very pleased, and we're seeing great growth internationally. Just happens that North America continues to do well as well, both EMEA and APAC are well ahead of their plan for the full year right now, so... Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair. Your questions, please. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Frank, I wanted to ask about the Inspire program, and how that's going a few quarters in? I guess just curious in terms of how long the sales cycles are there? When that might start to impact billings? And then, I guess are there any learnings to extract from what you're seeing with that in terms of informing your broad \u2013 broader go-to-market strategy? And then I've got one quick follow-up for Mike. Thanks. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. We're actually \u2013 I'm personally super pleased with how Inspire has evolved over the last year. The level of engagement that we have with our \u2013 really our top enterprise customers through that solution consulting staff has really sort of elevated our standing in those key accounts. We often work on Tier 1 systems that are very innovative, very transformative, and they really show where the business can go when you bring that quality of resource to a selling motion. What we're really trying to do down the line is, okay, how do we \u2013 how do we develop lighter versions of that selling motion for the entire sales organization? Because it's relatively small team, we have about 40 some people in the Inspire program and the trick is how do we standardize and scale that across the organization, where we have a lighter version of what we've learnt that or we know how to do, and be available to the broader organization. So, going very well, and we are looking forward to probably at our Knowledge Conference next year that we get to showcase some of those key Inspire accounts, and the work that's been done there. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, I guess Mike or Frank, either of you. If you look at some of the customers who are more advanced in terms of adopting ITOM. Can you give us a sense of how much they're spending their relative to ITSM? Is it one-to-one? Are they spending more or less? And just any sort of sense there would be super helpful. Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: There is no set pattern. We have some customers that are actually spending more on ITOM than they are on ITSM. But I would say in general, customers spend more on a per customer basis because ITSM is more developed. They're paying more for ITSM than ITOM, but ITOM is quickly catching up. We're seeing some very big deals at ITOM. We've actually this quarter to-date seen a nice deal, that's standalone ITOM, which \u2013 they're not an ITSM customer. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your questions please Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): [Technical Difficulty] (28:45 \u2013 28:50) financial services customer. Just some color on what was driving that new business? Was it extending ITSM globally or geographically? Was it [inaudible] (29:02)? Just some color on that would be great. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank. Yeah the big thing there, and by the way, this is a pattern that plays out over and over, is just massive modernization, okay? They are replacing dozens and dozens of legacy systems, and have a complete overhaul, complete redesign, complete refresh and really putting brand new systems, brand new infrastructure in place and that is just typical of our business in these large enterprise accounts where they're turning off a lot of old stuff and a lot of fragmentation and sprawl, big clean up and going in with a single platform approach and that's \u2013 as I said, that's typical for what we do. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. We've been getting such strong traction in HR, do you foresee (29:59) with some maybe major accounts with HR before you land with ITSM? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, it's not just a feature. We've been doing that for years. As I said earlier, sometimes we just can't go through the front door because there is incumbency or contractual issues. And we do it with HR and that has worked very well for us. I think, HR is a very, very key service domain as I think most people will appreciate from their own day-to-day work experience. And over the years they really have \u2013 they have been underinvested in service models and really managing services as opposed to just delivering service. And there is a lot of efficiencies to be had there in terms of staffing and there is a huge opportunity to improve the service experience itself, so we're very bullish on the HR opportunity. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your questions please. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, Mike. I've got two questions about the 4Q billings guide of $474 million to $479 million. First is, the third quarter was so strong, $20 million above the high end of guide. Was there any pull forward from 4Q? And then secondly, FX rates have been pretty volatile of late. Are there any FX hit to that 4Q billings guide that's worth calling out? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, every quarter, as I mentioned on last quarter you have \u2013 especially on the renewal side, you have deals that get pulled in and pushed out and it's nothing unusual this quarter. This year, renewals were extremely strong. And in Q4, we think our guidance appropriately reflects what we see in the business today. And I'm assuming we're going to have a normal quarter exiting Q4 with deals getting pushed and pulled on the renewal side. In terms of FX, yes, FX rates have moved as a reminder, 30% plus of our revenue is converted from euros and a big chunk of our business is in pounds as well till they get converted into euros and then dollars. And so, it does have an impact but we've reflected that in our guidance. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And if I could follow-up, Mike. On the free cash flow margins, they've been in the 23%, 24% range in each of last year and this year. I'm not asking you for guidance but as we look into 2017, are there any variables that you could call out that would enable perhaps you guys to post something higher than that in 2017 outside of normal margin expansion? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: We'll be giving guidance for 2017 in January. We've given you guys a framework for kind of how we see, over time how we will get free cash flow expansion as well as operating margin expansion based upon our growth rate. And where we sit today, we think that's appropriate still. And obviously, we'll revisit that in January when we give guidance for the full year. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Helpful, Mike. Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your questions please. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into sales capacity a little bit, both in terms of how we should be thinking about adding internal sales capacity into the back half of 2016, and also what type of expansion you're seeing in terms of contribution just as integrators, the pace if you will, that they are kind of expanding their practices around some of these new solutions and how that's helping your go-to-market strategy? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So in terms of head count, as we mentioned, we're going to add about 275 people in Q4. The bulk of that is going into our engineering and sales organization. I will say in our sales organization, we've been hiring a lot of these product specialists that aren't necessarily quota-carrying, but they're helping generate the pipeline for our quota-carrying reps, and we will continue to add at roughly that pace through 2017 based upon what we're seeing in terms of pipeline, and the way we're converting that pipeline to maturity and closing that these guys have been able to do. So that's kind of where we're thinking about head count. And sorry, what was your last question, the second half of that? Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: On the systems integrator side of the equation, what you're seeing in terms of them ramping up there, that's around products coming out with the new products...? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank. We're actually really pleased with the progress that we've made this year, especially with some of the larger ones like CSC and Accenture, both their internal uptake as well as their use as practitioners and as MSPs. So we see just \u2013 Dave (35:01) we're really a very significant part of their plans, and their growth objectives, and it's very well cemented in. That it was no longer \u2013 historically, a lot of these relationships were opportunistic, something comes up in an account, and we'll rest our hand, we'll do it. But now these businesses are so big for these large GSIs that this is now really managed resource and driven like any other business. So, we're (35:31), but we still have more room to cover. We'd like to make more progress with IBM for example and there is others out there, but on the whole, one of the reasons that we've driven our own professional services business down as a percentage of the overall mix is to make sure that we really, really create room for a very dynamic ecosystem, because that is what enables the growth of the business. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your questions please. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, thanks and great quarter, congratulations. I have two quick questions. First of all on the HR side, you're showing up a lot more on like HR-related consulting work. Can you talk a little bit about how your approach towards partnering with kind of pure play HR vendors like Workday or Cornerstone will drive you deeper into that vertical? And then the other thing is on the large account side, like we hear from some financial services (36:38) also other guys and when we talk with consultants, that people feel so strategic that they almost kind of restart the implementation to kind of get it right to get all the value out of it. Does that kind of impact your spending attempts for a while or will you just keep buying and you keep doing that process? Thank you. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: I wasn't following what your \u2013 the second part of your question was Raimo. Let me try to answer the first part on HR. We've had longstanding relationships with Workday and the reason is we're both cloud companies, there's often similar customers that will adopt both Workday and ServiceNow at the same time. There is really good value added integration between our respective platforms. We're starting to see more opportunities now with SAP as well. I think we're more on their radar, and I see certainly a relationship developing \u2013 a go-to-market relationship developing there as well. In general, and I think you are correct, we're starting to spike the radar on the HR site much more than we historically have, and we really expect that to continue. If you could reiterate the second part of your question now, I'll try to address that also? Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Hey Frank. So what I'm trying to say is like, if I look at some bigger accounts and you might suspect which one I talk about as well. What did you see is that you realize when we put in ServiceNow the first time we probably took some shortcuts and it will get full value out of it and I've heard that from a few accounts that are kind of re-implementing ServiceNow to just get \u2013 redeploy value-add. Does that impact the spending of those customers or is that just \u2013 are they isolated cases? Thank you. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Okay, I understand what you're talking about now. I mean, we certainly have customers that have implemented in years past and have come to the conclusion years later that hey, now that we really understand the capabilities of the platform, we would have done a whole bunch of things different. And instead of sort of forward engineering themselves, they do a reset and completely get a fresh instance and we implement right out of the box. It's much faster, it's much cleaner and people are much happier with that approach. This is one of the great things about ServiceNow that you can bootstrap and resurrect a new system in a very short period of time. One thing that I always tell customers is that, PowerPoint does not make you a better presenter and the people always laugh when I say that, but what it really means is, look, the software itself can be implemented very well, very fully, and everything in between. And if on the first attempt, you sort of haven't gotten everything out of it, that you would have envisioned, yeah, then there is room up to do better. One of the key challenges that we have when we work with our ecosystem of integrators and their own professional or services organizations to really drive people very hard towards outcomes, because if we don't, a lot of organizations will implement ServiceNow, and they're very happy. But in reality what they've done is, they've modernized, they have put their own old system in a new jacket and it looks different and it feels different, but fundamentally, they have not transformed. Everybody is still having the same jobs, and they sort of preserve the status quo and their existing systems. That's missed opportunity. So, it's very much incumbent upon us to really inspire, and there is that word again, to drive our customers to higher outcomes. And we really started that in 2016 to be much more aggressive, much more proactive to get customers to implement with much higher expectations than they historically might have. I mean IT is a conservative profession. People have a tendency to be very incremental in their approaches, and we as a provider really try to break people out of that and embolden them in their objectives and their expectation. The software can do it, the question is whether the organization can? Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Your questions, please. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Hi, thank you. Just one question, and I know this tends to be a sensitive topic, but we're getting lots of questions from investors about the leaked salesforce.com board presentation that showed it was conducting some due diligence on a number of cloud companies, including ServiceNow, and obviously, there is a lot you cannot comment on. But are there any key points at least that you'd like to make for investors around future M&A? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, this is Frank. I'm sure you guys know that everybody and his mother maintains presentations like that. Everybody reviews their lists with their boards and has a conversation about that. We have lists like that as well. You've been able to observe our M&A strategy over the years. Vendors talk all the time, especially in Silicon Valley. We don't necessarily talk about M&A, but we talk about many different aspects of our business. So, we didn't think this was as eventful as a lot of the industry observers thought that it was. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Your questions, please. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. I wanted to hit back on sales productivity, which seems to be tracking quite nicely. And I'm just curious if your go-to-market and pushing outside of ITSM has changed? Is this still kind of a land with ITSM, use that as a springboard to enter a different department or buyer, or are you finding more success in kind of bringing multiple constituents earlier into its cycle to sell this broader platform out of the gate? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, it's Frank. One thing that is really important to understand about ServiceNow is, there is not a hard line that says it's either ITSM or this other stuff, because a lot of the things that we refer to as emerging products are in effect, products that get used with ITSM. ITOM is obvious, but also our analytics products gets used with ITSM. All our business \u2013 IT business management products are used with ITSM. So in other words, these are value-added software capabilities that people use to enhance their use of the core ITSM applications. The only application that we have that's really distinctly different from our ITSM platform and really has no relationship to the ITSM business is Customer Service Management. Everything else really falls in the realm of IT management. So you can't sort of draw that hard line through it and say well, this is ITSM and the other stuff is a totally different business, that's not how our customers view it. It's not the way we view it. We just highlighted that there is a lot of traction and revenue momentum in these modules, but ServiceNow is one application. Do not forget that, right? It's one cloud, it's one database. We just turn on and off different modules, different services and different options, right? That's how it works and that's the reason why the selling motion works that well for us because this is really low friction to allow customers to take advantage of incremental capabilities. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. That may make my next question less relevant, but I was going to ask. I mean now with a couple of quarters of new ACV and emerging products, that 40% of new ACV. Just curious if you're seeing anything different in terms of who you're competing against in the competitive landscape? Anything you'd call out? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: It's not that different from what we've seen before. It's the same sort of, what legacy group that is trying to slow down their own attrition. On the platform side, there is people like salesforce, it really hasn't fundamentally changed. On the customer service side, we see a lot of very old legacy systems that we are replacing there. We are learning that business now in terms of the type of incumbency that is there, and we're seeing a really similar thing as what we saw in the ITSM side. Very old software, which is a good thing for us because that means there is the pressure to modernize and transform is going to be building. On the security side, it is a completely greenfield type of situation. People do not have these kind of systems today. So, depending on exactly what capability we're talking about, it's a different dynamic, but it really hasn't moved on from where it has historically been. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for the color and congrats again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your questions please. Kash Rangan - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Hi. I'm wondering what your prediction is to which analyst on this call is going to experience much better IT support quality service in their bank? That's not a serious question. Well, it could be, if you choose to answer it. You could say Brent or Keith or Kash or whoever it is, or one of you guys it will be. We'll do the guessing between each other. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: It's not Kash, yet. Kash Rangan - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Good. It's still in the pipeline, that's good to know. My question, serious question was, it looks like ITSM had a good quarter, so based on your percentage of net new ACV split, it looks like sequentially it was up very nicely. That had not been the case in Q3 at least last year. It's also up modestly on a year-over-year basis. As you look at this bounce back in the ITSM business, what is the right way to think about 2017? Because obviously, the percentage of net \u2013 the percentage of your net new ACV coming from non-ITSM will probably likely continue to expand. So is it even fair to expect net new ACV from ITSM to continue to grow or is it going to sort of flatten out? And my follow-up question is if it continues to compress, how are you going to be positioning your sales force to sell the HR product as Frank pointed out it's a completely different sale exploring partnerships with the likes of Workday, other HR companies that are complementary? Are you going to be creating a new separate swat sales organization, things along those lines? Thank you. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah so, a year and a half ago, almost two years ago now, we created a product line organization to really be able to drive hardcore focus on different business segments and obviously that focus has rippled through the entire company into professional services, into solution consulting, so our whole company now drives these individual product lines as separate businesses, even though our selling motions are altogether for the most part. So we are going to continue to do that. Security is going to grow into a full-blown, standalone business in the sense that it has its own business and its own function, its own set of partners and its own unique capabilities, the same is true for HR, certainly is true for customer service and we like that. We think the math is there for us to invest at considerable scale. I mean all those businesses can grow to a considerable size. Now on ITSM, I'm actually bullish on the opportunity that we have there. I think you've correctly characterized the growth dynamic this quarter for ITSM. There is a lot of things that are going on in that marketplace that I believe will revitalize that opportunity. One of the things that we've suffered from as a company is that we had a lot of shiny new toys and sometimes it's been hard for us to maintain the vigorous focus on a business like ITSM, which quite honestly a lot of our people didn't view it as sexy as some of the new stuff, but we have a lot of compelling new capabilities coming out in terms of Machine Learning NAI. We're going to be releasing comparative benchmarks. People can see how they're doing against their peer group and the rest of the industry. There is a lot going on. The service models are really evolving to heavily machine-to-machine, lights out, light speed touch service models from where people historically had been with service desk, which are very heavily people-mediated processes. There is an enormous amount of room for innovation and expansion in the world of ITSM. And I think it's been more of an execution issue on our part than it has been a market issue. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would add to that too Kash that if you look at our Global 2000 adds in the quarter, 22 of those out of the 23 had ITSM. That's one of the main selling features. If you look at 18 of our top 20 deals that includes both upsells as well as new customers. They all had ITSM in them, so it is a key to our business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your questions please. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Frank, as you're adding these product specialists, was it helping you accelerate the adoption of some of these new products? And should we expect that trend to accelerate in 2017, as many of these new hires will become fully productive? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I sure hope so, otherwise I will stop doing it. That is the point, right? We do everything with an eye towards, how quickly it is developing demand. Demand development is the critical metric for our business. We have very good capabilities in terms of converting demand to sales. We have very good abilities in terms of building and deploying capacity, but building demand is the hard part in our business. That's always the critical metric. So everything we do has a focus on that. So the specialist allocations that is completely done to accelerate demand development. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Mike, can you help us understand how should we think about your plans to expand gross margins? And if single tenant architecture makes it tough to achieve significantly higher margins, as part of that if we can also discuss, what are the advantages of the single tenant architecture that's tough to replicate in a multitenant environment? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Okay. Well, I'm the finance guy, and you're going to want me to talk about the technical differences (51:42) data center architecture. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Well, the margins... Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Let me answer your first question is, compute is compute, it's all automated the way we do things and whether you are a single tenant or multitenant, you're still going to need the same amount of compute power. And so it's not going to make a difference from a hardware standpoint. One of the big things though, that adds to our cost is we truly have mirrored data centers, where we are on a regular basis failing (52:09) our customers over from one data center to another to do the maintenance on our databases, which keeps us higher uptime. You've seen the margin expansion we've had, right, 84% on our subscription margin right now, which includes the support organization. And we truly have an Enterprise Class support organization that adds a lot of cost. We've given you our longer-term target model there, which you've seen and we're comfortable with that subscription margin there. I don't think there's really any difference because of our architecture. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Your question please. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give any general characterizations on \u2013 you have a lot of new products out there, if you thought about attach rates achieved to-date, in other words, if you thought about the installed base of call it, ITSM over the last number of years. What do you think your attach rates are achieved in aggregate? We certainly get some characterization of deals done in the quarter, but it would seem like there's still a long runway to go in terms of opportunity to go ahead and attach to that installed base established over the last number of years? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Roughly today about 69% of our customer base has two or more products. There is still room there, but if you look at our corporate analysis, you can continue to see our customers year-after-year buy 50% plus our initial purchase. A lot of that is adding to their existing products they have with more user licenses and we're seeing more and more now that they're also buying these new products and that was part of our whole strategy that's going to a multi-product company that we shifted to in 2015. So, I really don't have any more data than that. But... Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Fair enough. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: This is Frank. I think that's a very important angle that you sort of got to keep your eye on, because our whole game is to drive attach rates up for all our products. And we have an incredibly long ways to go for all our products. So even in our existing products, just to get to attach rates where we start to rifle the penetration that we have on the core platform, it's going to take years and years and years for us to get there, so lot of upsell opportunity. And Mike's right, is that the cohort analysis shows exactly that. And this is a big opportunity that's going to play itself out for years to come. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. If I could ask a follow-up question of you, Frank, just from one of the previous questions. It sounds like you think net new ACV even on the ITSM side, as you guys look out over the next year and calendar year 2017, it sounds like you would expect without putting numbers on it, but that can continue to grow as we look into calendar year 2017. Is that the conclusion from an answer to a previous question? Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your questions please. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. First one for Mike. Mike, can you characterize how you're feeling about kind of the start of 4Q versus maybe how 3Q started out? And then Frank, maybe just on the macro, it's been a volatile year maybe \u2013 how are you thinking about the macro environment today versus the beginning of the year? And has volatility actually created increased demand for the business? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, I'll start up with \u2013 we just gave guidance for Q4, and our Q4 guidance is based upon where we see our business for the quarter and we are off to a very good start and I'm pleased with it, don't really have much more to add to that. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes, this is Frank. I don't have any real color to give you on the macro, either for I think it's reasonable. We're obviously much more of a secular play. We think that we \u2013 we can still sell quite effectively when the macro is turning not so favorable and the reason is we're a transformational play. We're an optimization play. So, we sort of live below \u2013 I sometimes can't determine whether I'm dealing with macro or micro or secular influences. So it's hard for us to sort of have a real intelligent commentary about what the macro is and isn't because we sell right through that. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Your questions please. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, you mentioned verticalization on the sales side as part of your plan for next year. I'm wondering what your plans for that are on the product side? You've done a good job of pivoting your platform horizontally to-date. Do you plan to more heavily verticalize your platform with new products or is that something you expect to let your integrator partners run with? Thank you. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: No, we're going to do that and it's just \u2013 the verticalization, the first place you're going to see it is really on the marketing side, especially on the product marketing side, because the \u2013 and then the sales enablement will follow. In other words, how our sales people message, position and present themselves in the context of the industry that they're selling into. We have such critical mass in every major vertical that there is a huge amount of value for us to exploit. And it's just low hanging fruit, it's just in other words, we just got to take our learnings across the big pharmas, across big retail, everything that we've learned and diversified industrials and really, really use that in our selling motion. Now, as it evolves, it is quite possible that we will have products that are industry-specific, that we will not start off that way, but I think the deeper and better we get at this, it is quite possible that we get industry-specific products at some point. Healthcare is another one of those areas, state and local, federal. There is a ton of opportunity. I'm super excited about what we're going to do in this area, yeah. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thank you, Frank. Frank Slootman - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions today. So at this time, I'm now going to hand the call back over to Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer for closing comments or remarks. Sir? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the call over to Mike Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our Chief Executive Officer. Our press release, investor presentation and broadcast of this call can be accessed at investors.ServiceNow.com. We may make forward-looking statements on this conference call, such as those using the words may, will, expects, beliefs or similar phrases to convey that information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.  I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Slootman : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Q4 capped off an outstanding 2016, and we have strong momentum heading into 2017. Total revenues in 2016 grew 38% year over year to $1.4 billion, making ServiceNow the fastest-growing enterprise software company, with more than $1 billion in revenue. The strong quarter was driven by acceleration of net new ACV and a 97% renewal rate. 341 customers now pay us more than $1 million in ACV, an increase of 39 in the quarter. And 24 customers now pay us more than $5 million in ACV, an increase of six in the quarter. We also continue to track towards our 2020 revenue goal of $4 billion. We added a record 31 Global 2000 logos in the quarter, including General Mills, DNB Bank and Renault. Our average ACV for Global 2000 is now approximately 1.1 million, a 9% sequential increase and our commercial channels continue to balance out our global enterprise business.  There are three key things worthy of note. First, Q4 was punctuated by large deals. We booked a record 27 deals, with net new ACV greater than $1 million, 11 more than the next closest quarter. The highlight was an $11 million net new ACV upsell to a Global 25 customer, representing our largest net new ACV deal ever. We are replacing fragmented on-premise tools with a scalable platform that consolidates global ITSM and ITOM capabilities onto a single ServiceNow system. This transformation will reduce mean time to resolution and increase service availability, driving $100 million of savings over three years, and $44 million annually thereafter. A key reason for the size and speed of this transaction was Inspire, our elite advisory team that helps executives transform their business on ServiceNow. In Q4, Inspire contributed to five of our 10 largest transactions, and in 2016 engaged with more than 30 Global 2000 accounts. In addition to large deals with end customers, five of our 10 largest transactions in the quarter were with our global partners. The highlight was formalizing our partnership with IBM, who is now a top-three global strategic partner. We are teaming with IBM to bring world-class solutions to clients across the globe. The multi-year partnership will drive ServiceNow products with IBM services in a seamless and integrated engagement model. Second, 2016 saw an inflection in our expansion beyond ITSM. 72% of our customers now license multiple products beyond ITSM. 46% of our Q4 net new ACV was non-ITSM, and 94 of our top 100 deals in the quarter included products beyond ITSM. The strong performance of our emerging products enables us to have multiple conversations across the enterprise. As a result, we've lined up our new website at ServiceNow.com and other marketing efforts around these conversations, as well as the ability to easily add more solutions over time. Third, intelligent automation has become a key discussion topic with our customers. We are in a unique position to drive actionable insights and cost savings, because we have massive amounts of individual customer data. Our data centers post more than 10,000 customer instances, and our customers store critical volumes of operational data. Leveraging this data with machine intelligence will predict outcomes and automate actions. The ongoing disintermediation of workflows and business processes will bring on a new era of productivity and scale of operations. We recently developed ITSM benchmarks which provides aggregated KPIs for more than 3,000 customers, filtered by company size and industry. Benchmarks will also populate key recommendations for performance improvement and inject data insights directly into workflows. Additionally, we acquired DxContinuum, which uses data scientists to build predictive models that auto-categorize incoming requests from people and machines, increasing time to resolution and reducing costs. We're in the process of re-platforming the technology, and will demonstrate the technology at Knowledge17 in May. We will formally begin selling to customers later this year. Intelligent automation will become increasingly strategic for our customers, given their broad operational reliance on ServiceNow. Finally, as was previously announced, our Chief Operating Officer, Dan McGee, has stepped down. We are thankful for his many contributions over the past six years. We're also excited to announce CJ Desai as our Chief Product Officer, who has assumed Dan's responsibilities. Lastly, we look forward to seeing you all at our annual conference, Knowledge17, the week of May 8 in Orlando, Florida.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, Frank. During today's call, we will review our fourth-quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q1 and full-year 2017. We'd like to point out that the Company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, and for prior quarters' previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.ServiceNow.com. Before beginning, I want to point listeners to our investor presentation posted on our IR website. We disclose revenue adjusted for constant currency, and billings adjusted for constant currency and constant duration, to enhance comparability from period to period. We calculate constant currency and duration by applying the rate in effect during the prior period, rather than the actual rate in effect during the current period. Q4 was driven by a record $900 million of total contract value, which led to combined backlog and deferred revenue of $2.8 billion at the end of 2016. This represents year-over-year growth of 51%, up from 35% in 2015. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $386 million, representing year-over-year growth of 35% and adjusted growth of 37%, or an impact of $6 million. Total billings were $535 million, representing year-over-year growth of 46% and adjusted growth of 39%, or an impact of $27 million. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 84%, professional services and other gross margin was 18%, overall gross margin was 77%, and operating margin was 17%. Free cash flow margin was 29%, and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments. Let's turn to guidance for the first-quarter and full-year 2017. For the first quarter, we expect total revenues between $406 million and $411 million, representing 33% to 34% year-over-year growth, and 36% to 38% adjusted growth, or a $10 million impact. We expect total billings between $490 million and $495 million, representing 30% to 31% year-over-year growth, and 32% to 34% adjusted growth, or an $8 million impact. We expect an operating margin of approximately 11%, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately $177 million. For full-year 2017, we expect total revenues between $1.82 billion and $1.85 billion, representing 31% to 33% year-over-year growth, and 34% to 36% adjusted growth, or a $40 million impact. We expect total billings between $2.165 billion and $2.195 billion, representing 28% to 30% year-over-year growth, and 34% to 35% adjusted growth, or a $93 million impact. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, professional services and other gross margin of 20%, total gross margins of 77%, operating margin of 16%, and free cash flow margin of 24%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately $179 million for the year, and expect to add approximately 1,200 net employees in 2017. Before closing, please note, our Financial Analyst Day will be held on Monday, May 8 in Orlando, Florida. In-person attendance will be limited, so if interested, please send an email to IR at ServiceNow.com. For those who cannot join in person, we will hold a webcast of the event, accessible on our IR website.  With that, Operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong end of the year. ACV growth per customer was particularly impressive. I think it grew 9% sequentially. It looked like ITOM had a very strong quarter. I guess, Frank, could you comment on what else is driving this? What other products - are sale cycles shortening on some of these add-on sales? Just curious about that dynamic. Frank Slootman : Yes, so it wasn't one particular product sector that sort of carried the day. We were exceptionally strong across the board. Our core ITSM business was up by 25% sequentially. ITOM, as you mentioned, was very strong. All our emerging products, they have been very strong out of the gate during 2016. It is true that some of the newer products have shorter sales cycles than our traditional ITSM business. So that is another attractive feature for our sales organization. Matt Hedberg : And then maybe one follow-up for Mike. Even on an adjusted basis, subscription in total billings accelerated year on year. I'm curious though. Can you talk about the longer billing terms you are seeing? I'm curious what drove that. And should we expect that trend to continue? I'm talking about the subscription billing terms. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. There was really only one customer and it's a rate-regulated company that they prepaid five years that drove that. We were expecting a few. But I think that is kind of a one-time with that entity. Matt Hedberg : Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Oh, and I got another new name, thank you. Hey, if you actually think out about 2017, should we expect any big changes to - on the salesforce setup, on the salesforce composition, salesforce and how they got comped in terms of new products versus old products, et cetera? Frank Slootman : No. I mean there's not going to be any major changes on that front. The only thing that is beginning to change is that we are starting to structure in vertical industry-focused sales teams. We\u2019ve always had that. We are evolving in that area. That's a theme that you will continue to hear from us about, is to see increasing verticalization of our business. It's a very gradual process. It\u2019s not one big switch that we're throwing. But that's certainly a trend in how we are structuring our selling motions. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, perfect. Thank you. That's it actually for me already. Well done. That\u2019s very clear, the results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : Hi, thank you, and congratulations on the quarter, Frank and Mike. Really well done. It's Macquarie. A couple of questions, Frank, just to get started. You were talking to Raimo in particular about where you're adding some sales capacity. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of where you're adding product specialists to support your quota carrying reps? And then a quick question for you, Mike. So Mike, subscription revenue growth was really phenomenal year over year, and pro-serv not as much and it continues to be a drag. And I see your guidance for 2017, but is there any update you can give us in terms of where we should be thinking about your long-term professional services mix as you continue to deemphasize that product? Frank Slootman : So this is Frank. I'll try to answer your first question. Throughout 2016, we've been adding product specialization overlay, both from a sales and engineering standpoint, as well as in terms of pure sales leadership for all the non-ITSM segments. So there are teams for ITOM. There\u2019s team for customer service management, for human resource solutions, security operations. So all those plays have specialized sales teams that work with the broader salesforce on the commercial enterprise side to drive that business and we expect to continue that process in 2017. Michael Scarpelli : And Sarah, your question on professional services. So the one piece of our business that's the harder piece to forecast is the longer-term professional services. We have told people, our goal is to get our partners to do more and more of the professional services, have them invest in hiring people because if they hire people, they're going to have to drive more business to us, because we're going to have to keep those people busy. We will see growth in professional services, but it's going to be at a much slower pace than what our subscription revenue growth is. And I would say longer term, it will be sub-10% of our revenue. Sarah Hindlian : All right, thank you, guys. That's incredibly helpful. Great quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thank you. I'm wondering, Frank, if you could just give us some sense as to - you talked about shorter sales cycles in some of the emerging products. As you look into this year, do you expect any sort of change in momentum in some of those different products? And I don't know, I wouldn't think you would hazard a guess in terms of where you come out in terms of 2017 around which of those products is doing best. But how could you sort of give us some color around these different HR and security and so forth, and relative momentum within that group? Frank Slootman : Well, we're going to continue to - I mean, these products came out of the gate very strong in 2016. We had high expectations, but they still managed to exceed that. So they are growing into numbers now that are substantially contributing to the overall result. In 2017, our goal is to maintain that momentum. In other words, we're leaning in hard. We're investing heavily in the selling motion because it's working so well for us. So we\u2019re really going to push it along as fast and as hard as we can. The shorter sales cycles in some of those areas are good. Not all those products have that ERP replacement dynamic that we have in our core ITSM business which they are longer sales cycles and everything is more complicated. We're used to that selling motion. We're obviously pretty good at it. But the newer products often have a much more rapid sell-on motion and that's really good for our sales organization. Especially on security ops, those have markedly faster sales cycles than our average. Walter Pritchard : Got it. Great. And then Mike, for you. On the 2020 targets, I'm wondering if you would give us an update? I think probably the area we hear the most pushback or question is around the below G2K mix. Could you give us an update as to how that progressed in the quarter? And as you look out to 2017, how you think about the momentum in that business? I think it's going to be half your rev mix in 2020. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Well, that other segment of that business, that other 50%, so remember, it's G2K that are 50% of our revenue, and it continues there. Well, there's still a lot of other large enterprises that aren't G2K in the public sector. So that accounts for about 30% of our revenue. In the commercial segment, those companies with less than 5,000 employees, that only accounts for about 20% of our business, but it\u2019s growing very fast. And I think you're going to see a very similar mix through 2020. It's not all G2K. There's a lot of other large enterprise and commercial business out there, in the public sector in particular. Walter Pritchard : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hey, Frank and Mike. The backlog re-acceleration to 51% growth, we haven't seen that type of re-acceleration in a lot of other stories that we all covered. Was there something that you would point to that drove that meaningful backlog acceleration, or was it a confluence of several factors? Michael Scarpelli : Well, the biggest was our net new ACV for all of 2016 that we signed up. But as well, renewals is becoming a big piece of our contract value we sign every quarter as well. So it's the net new ACV as well as the renewals that really drove that backlog growth. And why it was driven so much was obviously the new products that we have. Brent Thill : And Frank, you mentioned the verticalization of the team. Can you give us just a little more color in terms of how widespread that will be and the size or scope of that investment in 2017? Frank Slootman : Well, we set up a sales organization for what we refer to as [SLED/MED]. So it's state and local higher Eds, and then the whole healthcare side. That's always been a really, really good business for ServiceNow. Those are just outstanding customers for us. And we felt that we could accelerate our presence in those vertical industry sectors by creating dedicated and specialized sales teams for that. Of course, we have a federal systems organization as well. So it's not a change in our sales model. It's really a refinement. That's the way you've got to think about it. We're doing it because we think we can develop demand faster with these kind of augmentations of how we go to market. I expect that over time, you will see further refinement. We have really strong critical mass in many areas, whether it's big pharma, whether it's big retail. So there's possibilities going forward. We're not doing any of that right now. We\u2019re not announcing any of that, but those are certainly possibilities because of critical mass that we have in those verticals. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair. Justin Furby : Thanks guys and congrats on a solid quarter. Frank, I wanted to ask about APAC and EMEA. It seems like those are two markets that are going to become increasingly important for the ITSM business in the next three, four years. So I guess I'm just wondering if you could give some thoughts around what you're seeing in terms of pipeline build and confidence and being able to continue to penetrate into those two markets. And then when you look at the current international customers, do you see them adopting other products like ITOM at a similar pace as what you see in North America? I guess, just wondering if you feel like it will be any harder or easier to cross-sell those international customers longer term? And then I do have one quick follow-up. Thanks. Frank Slootman : So the contribution of the Americas I believe is about 68%, which is relatively similar as what we've had. Obviously there's been a big currency head. So in relative terms, the non-US-denominated businesses have done really, really well for ServiceNow and we're pleased with the development of the business there. It is true that they are not as far along on the non-ITSM product adoption, but we see that as nothing but upside opportunity going forward. They always have lagged in maturity and adoption relative to the Americas, so there's just more ground to cover for us going forward. Doing very well outside of the US, and we like our business there. Justin Furby : Got it, thanks. And then Frank, just on the Inspire program, it seems like that's paying early dividends. And I guess just wondering what your plans are, if you look out over the next couple of years, in terms expanding that team and how incremental might that be to billings, if you think out over the next few years? Thanks again. Frank Slootman : The Inspire team has been really great. They've been able to engage with customers really around innovation and transformation, really aiming for higher impact than what people might normally expect. It's much more of an elite consulting-type team. Now going forward, we're going to aim them specifically toward strategic transformations. It's really for organizations that want to really move up the maturity scale, really transform their businesses. That is not an easy thing to do. It's not for everybody, but the Inspire team is really for the leading edge of our customer base that really wants to push that envelope in terms of automation, and really go on lights-out, light speed. And we are developing standard models, standard metrics to do that, and the Inspire team is going to lead the charge. And the whole theme behind the Inspire team is that they blaze the trail, and then they hand off to the broader organization to really execute on the methods that they develop, and then apply that to the broader business. Justin Furby : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Thanks, guys. I guess, Frank, obviously a lot of large big deals, and obviously the ACV growth in the bigger customer base was really impressive. I was just kind of curious. Obviously these are still long sales cycles. So as you've gone through from - a lot of these deals probably started, I imagine nine, 12 months ago, did the size of the deal grow as the deal progressed through the funnel? I'm just kind of curious if you guys are doing a better job of, as you get into negotiations, bringing in the ITOM experts and others so that really what we saw at the end of the year was the buildup - the buildup happened over the course of the year. I assume that's the case, but I was just curious if you could comment on it. Frank Slootman : Yes, so the very important thing to understand here is that ServiceNow is a platform, not a portfolio of applications, okay? So that means we are always selling the full platform, the full range of options that are available to our customers. And in both the primary selling motion and the upsell, it has a tendency to expand the transaction. So it's very important to understand is that we don't go to markets strictly for an HR opportunity or strictly for a security opportunity. We do that, but fundamentally we start off by presenting ServiceNow as a platform with a full range of capabilities, and driving the full adoption of the platform, rather than just one thing which is why we emphasized in our prepared remarks how many customers are buying multiple products. So that selling motion is working exceptionally well for us. We are being seen by our customers as a platform, not a bag of tools. Kirk Materne : Okay. And then Mike, obviously I assume AR going up this quarter had more to do with just the big deals coming at the very end of the year. And if I was just going to move that forward in the first quarter, I assume that means we're going to get a little bit more seasonality in terms of a strong first-quarter cash flow number. Is that the right way to think about it? Michael Scarpelli : Q1 is a strong cash flow, because of the fact there were a lot of billings that went out at the end of the month that weren't due as of December 31. However, month one is a month that we make a lot of investments in terms of it's usually one of our largest hiring months. We also do our sales kickoff. So a lot of that cash receipts, there is a fair bit of disbursements with their incremental expenses in Q1. Kirk Materne : Okay, that's helpful. Congratulations on the quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits : Hey, guys, good evening. One for Frank, one for Mike. For Frank, which of the newer products are you beginning to land with that you are selling independently of service management? And then for Mike, you've got free cash flow margin up a point into next year, but then to get to those 2020 targets you've got to accelerate that and really start to see some leverage. So can you walk through how and when you get that free cash flow margin leverage? Frank Slootman : This is Frank, Michael. We\u2019re able to land with all products, but the standout product that we have landed with in 2016 that is new is customer service management, so the external-facing customer service management products. And since that is a very new selling motion for us, different type of customer that we're talking to, it's been super-encouraging for us that those people bought ServiceNow for the very first time in that class of solution. Michael Scarpelli : And then Michael, on your question with regards to cash flow with our 2020 targets, as we laid out in our investor deck at our Analyst Day last year, and it's on page 18 our framework for growth, we're still seeing us in the high-growth phase, as we laid out our adjusted growth rate. It\u2019s 34% to 36% for next year. So we're kind of right at that 35%, so were only planning to add zero to 1% in free cash flow. And if our growth slows down, you'll see more dropping to the bottom line, and the free cash flow as well, too. So I feel very comfortable with that framework. Michael Turits : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I think probably one of the things that most surprised guys about this quarter is your ability to still actually increase the number of G2K customers that you had in the quarter, with 31. I wanted to dig into that a little bit in terms of, if you could give us some detail into the characterization of those G2K customers. Are we still talking about all guys who are starting with ITSM? Or is it sort of broadening out more that you guys did in G2K with other products today? Then if we think about the 2020 target of getting to 1,000, is that 2020 getting to 1,000 - is that 1,000, is that all going to be ITSM G2K customers or is that more of a portfolio of across your solution? Michael Scarpelli : So I\u2019ll talk first, and then I\u2019ll let Frank. So the vast majority of the G2Ks that we land that all start with ITSM as one of the products, they have many products and it's no different from what we\u2019ve seen in other quarters. We are starting to see though, some of our G2Ks buy a lot of other products and make some big purchases day one, ITOM in particular, when they are buying ITSM. And we are also seeing a fair bit of upsells into our Global 2000 existing customers is driving that incremental growth with our newer products. In 2020, we really haven't modeled out what the composition of revenue from the different products is going to be within our Global 2000 because right now for us, a dollar is a dollar. I'm really not that hung up as to what product it relates to. Obviously our GMs who have these numbers, they want it all to be their product. And I'll let Frank talk more about that. Frank Slootman : Yes. I was going to emphasize that as well, that the vast majority of our Global 2000 adds are ITSM/ITOM sells. The one thing that we are seeing is that the Global 2000 have a tendency to really buy into the ERP for IT which means it's not just ITSM. It\u2019s the combination of ITSM, ITOM, IT business managements. It's analytics. They're really trying to put together a full-on ERP for IT they can globally consolidate and standardize their operations with. And that's a very powerful, high-value selling motion that we have in these very big accounts. Keith Weiss : Got it. And then if I could squeeze in one last one. When we're talking about the solutions outside of the IT department, outside of core ITSM and IT operations management, could you talk to us a little bit about the competitive environment? Who are you coming up with in those engagements? Is it going to be someone sort of from a traditional vertical perspective, like a Salesforce.com in a customer service engagement? Or are there other platform vendors who are coming at the equation from more of a workflow standpoint, like you guys are? Frank Slootman : I would say and I've seen a lot of customers last year as well as the last quarter that, when it comes to IT, I mean I think customers are starting to drop all pretense that there really is anybody else in the mix. It used to be that some of the legacy people like BMC and HP were used as sort of a pawn in the negotiations. That seems to be less and less of a factor, and people are just conceding that you guys are the ones and you know, we go from there. So getting deals done is not a walk in the park obviously, because these are big EFP-style implementations and projects.  But they don't necessarily have the competitive frictions and pressures that we have historically have had. Now, you get into other parts of the business, there's totally different competitors in the mix when you talk about security, very different dynamic. Customer service management, obviously we're now dealing with people like Oracle and Salesforce and so on, that have big businesses in those areas. So it varies depending on what part of the business we're talking about. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you very much, guys. Great quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Owens from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Robert Owens : Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Frank, you talked about the issue, go-to-market presenting the platform and I guess I'm curious. You mentioned sales cycles for some of the new modules being quick, but as you look at customer acquisition and people looking at multiple modules if you will of the platform, do you see any extension in sales cycles? And I guess that drives a second question, if I can get them both in. In terms of new logos for customers where you're running well-ahead of your 17% per quarter expectation to get to the 2020 number, is there anything in the pipeline that suggests any slowing that you might see in terms of new customer acquisition in the coming year? Frank Slootman : I'm not sure that we're expecting any change in that dynamic, Mike. Michael Scarpelli : No, I don't see any slowdown in new customer acquisition. Obviously every year, upsells becomes a bigger and bigger component of our overall new net ACV. ACV by virtue of the fact that our installed base grows every year, but definitely new customer, new logo acquisitions is a key focus of our sales organization. Frank Slootman : Your other question was about, do incremental services added to the deal slow down the transaction? I don't think we have any real evidence of that slowing down our deals. If anything, it tends to cement transactions, because people are really buying into the platform strategy which is obviously exactly what we're aiming for. Robert Owens : All right, thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hey, congrats guys. Let me just rattle off a few questions very quickly, if you don't mind. One, did you have any pull-in from Q1 to Q4? And also related to that, Frank had mentioned verticalization specialization quite a bit. Wondering if that means that you have any possible salesforce reorg happening in the quarter? And finally, your perspectives on public cloud, how your customers are prioritizing the public cloud vis-a-vis investing deeper in ServiceNow? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : I'll start with, first there was nothing unusual in terms of pull-in or push-out in the quarter. There was nothing unusual in terms of early renewals with customers. We just had a very, very solid quarter. And what I would say is typically you see deals as you get towards the end of the quarter push out some deals. That happens every quarter. I would say this quarter was nothing that pushed out. And I think our salesforce did a really good job of executing and calling out the number internally to us. Frank Slootman : So in terms of your second question, there really is no massive restructuring on the sales side. There's just a specialization where we have an organization that only calls on this particular vertical industry class of accounts, versus them being spread across a vertical. So from a structured standpoint, it's very benign and very moderate. You're not going to notice a whole lot of difference there. And I'm trying to remember your last question? Kash Rangan : The public cloud, how your customers are prioritizing their investments in public cloud vis-a-vis deepening their commitment to ServiceNow, which may seem a little bit at odds with each other, but wanted to get your perspective. Frank Slootman : I have tons of conversations with customers and that just never comes up. It's not a vector that they are torn by as top-of-mind. Their use of public cloud versus ServiceNow, it's not viewed as one or the other, or one as a substitute for the other, or prioritized differently. For our customers, they're buying the service, right? Whether they are buying an infrastructure service from a public cloud vendor versus they are buying the services from ServiceNow, they are two totally different things. They are not viewed as competing or sort of contesting for resources. Kash Rangan : And also, if you could, ITOM was a fantastic quarter, but is this business lumpy or have you hit an inflection point? That's it for me. Thank you. Frank Slootman : Yes, I said that earlier. In the Global 2000 accounts, the pairing of the entire ERP of IT platform play, which is ITSM, ITOM, IT business management analytics, that bringing together the entire ERP is a very, very strong selling motion. It used to be that a customer would get started with ITSM, and then over time they would gradually build out to some of the other modules. Now they are biting off the whole concept. And the pairing of ITOM and ITSM is very, very strategic, and it's a key reason for customers to really swallow the entire ServiceNow strategy, as it relates to IT versus some subset of the capabilities. Kash Rangan : All right, beautiful. Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : I would say, Kash, though, ITOM deals tend to be bigger deals, and bigger deals tend to be a little bit lumpier. Kash Rangan : Beautiful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks. And you may have just answered the question, but I just want to see if it's clear. I mean, you obviously had a breakout quarter for deals over $1 million. And historically, it's come from expanding the installed base. But are you seeing a trend of initial deals starting to be a lot bigger out of the gate? It sounds like that's the case, and especially driven by ITOM but just wanted to get confirmation on that. Michael Scarpelli : Actually, of the 27 deals that we did over $1 million, only three initial new customer deals were north of $1 million. So it still is a lot of times that it\u2019s the customers will buy in. They may make big buys initially to get to know us, and then there are some really big add-on sales. And that was highlighted by Frank when he talked about that one Fortune 25 account that we did $11 million-plus ACV deal with. They were already a million-dollar customer for us. Derrick Wood : Okay. And then I guess also a follow-up on the last question. ITOM has been lumpy. Do you see that starting to get a little bit more fluid in 2017? And maybe, Frank, if you can just give us perspective on how the motions played out and progressed with ITOM in 2016, and how you see it taking place in 2017? Frank Slootman : Well, ITOM and ITSM are cousins. They share a common data repository. They go hand-in-hand, historically been true, and it is absolutely true in terms of our selling motion. ITOM is a different business from ITSM. As much as they are closely related, it is very different because we do go on-premise. It's really a cloud on-prem relationship. From a deployment standpoint, it's different. It's a very different professional services engagement as well. We have historically not been as mature in that aspect of our business. We've been working pretty hard on that, and we continue to work pretty hard on that, but that business damn-near doubled year on year. So we're going to be investing as hard and as fast as we can to keep that up in 2017. Derrick Wood : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Lemenager from Baird. Your line is open. Matt Lemenager : Hi, thank you. We just talked about ITOM a lot, but I have one more question. The attach rate jumped this quarter, had been ticking down, jumps to 21. I was wondering, was this mix of ITOM close to what your expectations were for the quarter initially? Or was ITOM maybe a bigger piece than you thought and got better traction? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : We are very pleased with what the final results were for ITOM and I would say it was tracking ahead of plan, as well as all of our newer emerging products are tracking ahead of plan. I think we've said before, we really feel our TMs in those groups, with what we're seeing in sales, we're firing on all cylinders there. We're very, very pleased. You guys are just focused on ITOM. We are focused on all of our products, which have been doing phenomenally well for us. Matt Lemenager : Right, makes sense. And then maybe one for Frank. Is there any ASP lift that comes from layering on automation and machine-learning into your product? As you bake in or re-platform the DxContinuum, I'm wondering if that's something that gets modernized? Or is AI something that just becomes table steaks, and companies have to have strong AI and machine-learning capabilities to offer a best-in-class product like you do? Just I wanted to hear your thoughts on that? Frank Slootman : Yes, good question. We're actually debating that pretty hard internally. We haven't come to final conclusions on that. I certainly feel that those are core platform capabilities, because that can be applied to any kind of data. It really doesn't matter what it is. It's very generic technology in that sense. I mean, it's been applied to CRM systems, and we're going to apply it to any data source. It has a very high productivity impact, because there is direct correlation between what those capabilities provide and the staffing that exists around service desk operations. So there's going to be a very good relationship between cost savings, and the business case is going to be super-compelling for our customers which of course leads our salesforce to believe that they can charge extra for that. But we don't want to grow up and become a supplier that nickels and dimes their customer for every new thing that's coming out. So we're going to exercise some caution and good reason there before we pull the trigger on exactly what we're going to do there. But we are excited about this entire strategy, and the benefit that our customers are going to get from it. Matt Lemenager : Great. Thank you, and congrats again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from DB. Your line is open. Karl Keirstead : Thank you. Question for Mike. First, congrats on the billings numbers. I wanted to ask you though on free cash flow, just to go back to that question. If you hit your guide for 2017, if we look at the period 2015 through 2017, operating margin will have gone up 600 basis points, but free cash flow margins will be flat to up 100 basis points. And I just wanted to make sure I understood that dynamic, whether this is sort of the normal narrowing of the operating margin and free cash flow margin, given the SaaS ratable model? Or is there just anything you would flag that might be keeping the free cash flow margins flattish, despite that great billings and margin performance? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. You\u2019ve got to remember, there's a couple components that come into free cash flow. Obviously there\u2019s the operating cash flow, which is strong and then you have your capital expenditures. When you're adding - we added close to 1,200 employees last year, 1,100 and something. We're going to add 1,200-plus employees this year. There's a lot of facility requirements associated with that. And our plan is to continue to add quite a few employees, because we see the opportunity in our business. That has a big impact on our free cash flow. And as long as we are growing at 35% plus, you're going to see zero to 1% being added to our free cash flow every year, and you are going to see that 2% to 3% in operating margin. And we just guided to that 3% improvement in operating margin, and I kept the free cash flow at 1%. Karl Keirstead : Got it. Okay, that's clear. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kevin Kumar : Hi, this is Kevin Kumar calling in for Jesse. Thanks for taking my question. So analytics attached to the majority of large deals this quarter. How much of an uplift to bookings does analytics provide and what's driving the adoption there? Frank Slootman : Well, we can speak to what's driving the adoption. What analytics do is really enable the top-level visualization and actionable insights into what's going on in the business. So it's really, really important for our customers to have this. Otherwise, it's really data entry and reporting. So the visualization of real-time data is what analytics provide. I think we now have 1,000 customers in analytics business has done really, really well. We have invested a lot in it. We\u2019re going to continue to. This is really an important part of our whole strategy. As I said earlier, it's the entire ERP platform that we're selling. Analytics is a core element of that. Kevin Kumar : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba, Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys, thanks. This is [Patho] sitting in for Abhey. I'll add my congrats for the quarter. Just a quick follow-up on to a prior question. Can you give us any more color more broadly across the installed base? Any color around your mix assumptions for the full year outlook when it comes to ITSM versus non-ITSM? Michael Scarpelli : ITSM I will say in 2020 is still the majority of our revenue. That is what gets us in the door. The only thing we have said is that we think ITOM can be roughly 15% of our revenue in 2020. And what we have said before is it would need to average about 19% of our net new ACV to get to that 15% of our revenue. I have to tell you, you guys are more concerned about the product mix than we are. We are happy. We really just look at total revenue. And as I said before, we are really hitting on all cylinders across our product lines, as well ITSM is coming off a very, very strong quarter and year for us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, good. That's very helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Phil Winslow : Hey, thanks guys for taking my question, and congrats on a really great Q4. You know, Frank, I just wanted to double-click on your comments on the customer service side. Obviously you highlighted that as an area of attraction in 2016, and obviously there was a big highlight back at your user conference and Analyst Day. When you think about the wins that you\u2019ve had in 2016, whether it be versus your established vendors in the customer service space, or call it just replacements or any sort of internal developed product, what's the kicker that gets people to choose you all over let's say even an Oracle or a Salesforce.com. I know you highlighted GRC integration, ITSM integration. But maybe you can help us kind of put some framework on that? And actually also, how much of those are sort of driven by, call it the front of the house, versus you all leveraging your position with the CIO? Frank Slootman : So that's my favorite question. The positioning that we bring to customer service is that we view it as a team sport. In other words, it's not just being used by customer service representatives\u2019 gold center folks. We take a holistic view. So there is a single process that brings the customer service people, the engineering people in the back office that actually do really work on the underlying problem management, and any operational staff that apply changes. So in other words, we don't view customer service as an isolated activity. It's a team sport. It's completely integrated with engineering and operations functions.  Now, this is not a new concept to CIOs, because they come from the world of incident problem and change where that model is pretty much doctrine. We are bringing that doctrine to customer service. And of course, IT people recognize it, and they go that is absolutely the right way to do customer service. So we get a lot of traction with customer service management, because it's really a hybrid, a merger if you will, between customer service and service management. And that is a very highly differentiated positioning relative to what\u2019s available in the marketplace. Phil Winslow : Thanks guys. That was great. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Bachman : Okay, thank you. I wanted to go back to the ITSM for a second. You provided very strong subscription billings growth of 36% to 38% adjusted for calendar year, for FY17. When you think about ITSM, is it the same neighborhood that you would envision it growing along the same lines? I would assume it would be less, since you had, as you said, triple-digit growth in ITOMs. But if you could just give any directional color on how you see ITSM within the context of the subscription billings you provided? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : As I've said before, we really don't look at our business that way. As Frank said, when we go into customers, we're selling a platform. They are not different applications. And we are not going to go down that path of trying to guide to different product lines. If you talk to each of our individual GMs, they all think in 2020 and this is outside of ITSM, because we are already there. They think they can all earn in five years from now. They all think they can be a billion-dollar revenue business. Now, I'm not guiding to that, but that's how bullish these guys feel on their own product lines. And so we don't think we need to manage with the street on different products. We're just - it's a platform. Keith Bachman : Okay. Well, let me ask the question slightly differently on a philosophical basis. As you are landing new customers and I understand the platform, you're able to sell a number of different products once you land the new customers, what's bubbling up as your landing those new customers with the most frequent product gaining that traction? Is it still ITSM? Michael Scarpelli : It is. ITSM is in virtually every single new Global 2000 account that we land and we do not see that changing at all. Keith Bachman : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald from Wunderlich Securities. Your line is now open. Ryan MacDonald : Thanks, guys. Congrats on the great quarter. I just wanted to follow up on what you're seeing in the security operations. I know it's a fairly early-stage product there, but it's been in I think a space in security and overall we are seeing I guess some shifts in spending. And just want to hear what your approach has been with that product since you introduced it? Frank Slootman : This is Frank. Security response is an area that really does not have any incumbency of any kind. It's a novel concept for our customers. They have heavily invested in enforcement technologies like firewalls and endpoint technologies and vulnerability scanning, all these kind of things. I think the average account has like 75 different security tools that they own and there is nothing on the response side. There's just people sitting around with spreadsheets and accessing different websites, trying to do threat intelligence and so on. So we bring complete workflow discipline to the back end of the process of managing security. This is a huge opportunity, because everybody needs it and nobody has it, other than purely manual tools of email spreadsheets and so on. So it's exciting. It has a faster sales cycle. It has very good average pricing to it. It is just wide open. There is no incumbency of any kind. So this is an example of the sort of thing that ServiceNow likes to do. Ryan MacDonald : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell from Northland Securities. Your line is now open. Tim Klasell : Hey, I throw my congratulations in there as well on a great quarter. My question has to do with the application. I know you guys are probably getting beaten up about it a little bit, or beating this one maybe a little too much. But as I look at how the customers use the products, a few years ago if you wanted to have a security response-type product or what have you, you had to take your platform and build it yourself. Now you offer it, and it makes it a faster sales cycle, faster downtime to value, I'm sure. But how about the number of people using the product? Is your product broader so that there's actually more users, again people getting more value out of it? Or is it more of a narrow product, and just used to help them get up to speed faster? Maybe you could help clarify that for me. Thank you. Frank Slootman : I'm not sure that I understood the question in terms of the delineation that you're looking for. Can you elaborate? Tim Klasell : Yes, sure. So let's say on a security incident response, maybe there might be in a large corporation, four or five users of that process if they built it themselves, because they maybe have a narrow scope that they are trying to address. Does your application come in broader, so that maybe there's 10 users of that process, because you have more capability than what they would build internally? Frank Slootman : Yes, it does come in broader, because it's not just the security people that use it. What we do is, we really integrate the workflow between security and IT people. You've got to remember that when action has to be taken, typically the actions are taken not by security people, but they're taken by IT people because they own network devices, database servers, system servers and so on. So there are typically way more people involved than just the security analysts that are trying to do threat intelligence and things of that sort. So it is a much broader process than the way people have historically prosecuted security response processes, if they had them. Michael Scarpelli : But I would say another way too, there always was a certain segment of our customers who would have built the application themselves. The vast majority though would not have and they probably would have been doing it in Excel. And so by virtue of having those products, it opens up so many more users for us to sell to. Tim Klasell : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, thanks guys. Frank, can you talk about maybe what the level of realization is that you're seeing around the overall ServiceNow value position value prop from customers that are spending over $10 million in ACV, versus those that are spending $1 million to $5 million? And I guess how many in your mind are ultimately going to be in a position to do that? Frank Slootman : Well, we believe that these Global 2000 accounts have - they're like markets onto themselves. That is an almost unlimited opportunity for all reasonable intents and purposes. When we get going with these large accounts, they are typically envisioning globalization and standardization across everything, all their geos, all their businesses. They want to have a single view of what's going on, and then they really want to get into the ERP mode, where they are layering on all the other incremental services in terms of business management and financials and analytics and project management, on and on and on. So I think the opportunity is - by the way, we just talked about security. That obviously is a sell that also very closely drafts that ERP selling motion. So we will be able to come up forever with new opportunities to sell. And the only reason that we are slowing it down, we've got to give our sales and marketing team an opportunity to really mobilize themselves, resource and equip themselves because we could easily overwhelm them from the product side, and obviously that would not be in the interest of the business. So we're pacing ourselves but we have a ton of opportunity in the pipeline to prosecute incremental opportunities. Alex Zukin : Got it. And then maybe another question adjacent to that is, when you think about a platform, you look at other companies like Salesforce that have ISVs and other companies that are building on top of their platform. You have some of that as well, but can you maybe talk about strategically how you think about that over the next couple of years with your partners? Frank Slootman : Yes. Well, we have - and we talked about this at a conference last year in Vegas very extensively. We have a conference just for professional application developers that will build applications that they will sell. We brought a lot of infrastructure, a lot of support for that. We started ServiceNow Ventures, who are actually investing and funding companies that are building applications on our ServiceNow platform. So we're doing all the things to stimulate that entire trend. Obviously it takes time for people to get going, build things, take it to market but that's an ongoing process over here. So we're certainly not of the mindset that we're going to do everything ourselves. We're very much interested in stimulating broader adoption by application developers that are not us. Alex Zukin : And then Mike, maybe if I could squeeze one in. Was there anything that didn't perform in terms of the product mix that you wanted to be maybe better in the quarter? Michael Scarpelli : There's nothing that I could say I wish were better. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Scarpelli for closing remarks. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investor section of our website. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before diving into our Q1 highlights, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Frank Slootman's leadership at ServiceNow. When Frank became CEO six years ago, ServiceNow had 375 employees and only $93 million in revenue. One year later, in June of 2012, Frank led the company through an IPO. Since that time, ServiceNow has been the best performing stock of all software IPOs. Today, ServiceNow employs over 5,000 people, generates revenue of $1.4 billion and has a market cap of approximately $15 billion, representing incredible growth and value creation during Frank's tenure. Along the way, he built outstanding relationships with our employees, our customers, partners and investors. And I'm inheriting a well-managed, well-positioned organization. Frank has been extremely helpful during this transition, and I look forward to continuing to work with him as our Chairman of the Board. I could not be more excited about leading ServiceNow into our next phase of growth. When I stepped down as CEO of eBay, I had the opportunity to survey the technology landscape. And it became clear to me that cloud businesses are disrupting both consumer and enterprise experiences for the better. I witnessed this firsthand in the consumer space where cloud-based applications like eBay and PayPal are transforming how consumers behave. But we're still in the early innings of enterprise transformation and a lot of opportunity remains. I first met ServiceNow while I was at eBay as a happy and satisfied customer. And the more I explored this opportunity, the more I fell in love with this company. I believe ServiceNow has the potential to become one of the great enterprise software companies of this era and I'm committed to building an enduring company. I've been on board for a little over three weeks, and have had the good fortune of spending that time listening and learning from our customers, partners and employees. In fact, I just returned from my two-and-a-half week listening tour where I met with over 70 different customers in eight cities across the U.S. During these conversations, three themes stood out. The first is that our customers absolutely love our products and they love our platform. And importantly, they want to do more with us. Rarely in my business career have I seen such an enthusiastic customer base. We pride ourselves in high customer satisfaction and our average NPS score is 50, which is considered world-class for the enterprise technology industry. Once we land a customer, they continue to buy from us as is demonstrated by our 97% renewal rate in Q1. A second theme is that many of the largest systems integrators in the world are rapidly investing in ServiceNow's ecosystem. As we look to $4 billion of revenue and beyond, our partners will significantly influence our growth as they implement solutions for our shared customers, provide outsourcing services and consume our products internally. To more quickly respond to increased ServiceNow demand, the largest SIs continue to acquire smaller ServiceNow partners. For example, in Q1, Accenture made two additional European partner acquisitions. I recently met with Jack Sepple, Senior Managing Director of Accenture's Cloud and Operations Group. And he said that these acquisitions show that Accenture is focusing on ServiceNow growth as they seek to maintain their leadership position in the ServiceNow ecosystem. In Q1, 62% of our ACV was influenced by partners and we expect that percentage to increase in the years ahead. The third theme is that we have a real opportunity to raise our visibility and awareness with executives and decision makers across the enterprise. We're well-known within IT and with CIOs. But our platform is being aggressively deployed outside of IT to provide real value in areas such as HR, security and customer service. And we continue to show strong growth addressing new product opportunities as 93% of all customers now license more than one product and 47% of our Q1 net new ACV came outside of ITSM compared with 33% a year ago. In Q1, we continue to see this theme play out, with strong up-sells driven by existing customers adopting new used cases. For example, a Global 50 customer that pays $2.5 million for ITSM added an additional $1.7 million primarily for Customer Service Management and ServiceWatch. Another interesting trend we're seeing is the extension of our platform to manage relationships outside the enterprise. This customer is using ServiceWatch to not only map internal services, but also map external services and they're using customer support management to resolve the underlying issues. In my discussions with customers, they increasingly view our platform as a way to manage work across and outside of enterprise. This awareness makes ServiceNow even more relevant and more strategic to our customers, and we're excited by this large opportunity. Rapid success and strong growth in many of our newer products is driven by the commonality of our cloud infrastructure and our platform, which are inherent in each of our products. Our platform includes many reusable components such as workflow, CMDB, collaboration, analytics and intelligent automation. The strength of our platform provides customers with a full range of service options while maintaining the same look, feel and common usability. This strategy will be a key theme at our upcoming Knowledge Conference and Financial Analyst Day in Orlando, and I hope to see many of you there. In closing, I want to reiterate how excited I am to lead ServiceNow in the next leg of growth. Our Q1 results and my recent discussions with customers, employees and partners strengthen my view on our tremendous opportunity and my belief that our best days are ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you, John. During today's call, we will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q2 and full-year 2017. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarter's previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. We ended the quarter posting strong operating metrics across the board. 370 customers now pay us more than $1 million in ACV, an increase of 28 in the quarter compared to an increase of 18 in Q1 2016. We also added 26 G2K logos in the quarter, including 11 in Americas, eight in EMEA and seven in APAC. Our average ACV per G2K is now approximately $1.1 million, a 2% sequential increase. Total revenues for the first quarter were $417 million, representing year-over-year growth of 36% and an adjusted growth of 39% or an impact of $7 million. Total billings were $529 million, representing year-over-year growth of 40% and an adjusted growth of 37% or an impact of $12 million. Subscription gross margin in the quarter was 84%. Professional services and other gross margin was 4%. Overall, gross margin was 76% and operating margin was 13%. Free cash flow margin was 37%. And we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments. Let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2017. For the second quarter, we expect total revenues between $458 million and $463 million, representing 34% to 36% year-over-year growth and 37% to 39% adjusted growth on a $11 million impact. Revenue guidance includes approximately $16 million related to Knowledge with the related expenses of approximately $34 million recorded in sales and marketing. We expect total billings between $491 million and $496 million, representing 31% to 32% year-over-year growth and 36% to 37% adjusted growth or an $18 million impact. We expect an operating margin of approximately 11% and diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 179 million. For the full year of 2017, we expect total revenues between $1.86 billion and $1.88 billion, representing 34% to 35% year-over-year growth and 36% to 37% adjusted growth or a $26 million impact. We expect total billings between $2.235 billion and $2.255 billion representing 32% to 33% year-over-year growth and 34% to 36% adjusted growth or a $37 million impact. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, professional services and other gross margin of 15%, total gross margin of 77%, operating margin of 16% and free cash flow margin of 25%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 179 million for the year and expect to add approximately 1,200 net employees in 2017. Before closing, please note, our Financial Analyst Day will be held on Monday, May 8 in Orlando at 12 :30 PM local time. We will also hold a webcast event accessible on our IR website. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks very much, and congrats on the quarter. John, maybe I'll start with you and congratulations on the new position. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : You mentioned the opportunity for ServiceNow to move beyond IT. I was just kind of wondering \u2013 yeah, I realize you've been here very short time. But what needs to happen in terms of \u2013 is the product portfolio ready to go in that regard? Is the sales organization set up to be able to do that? Is there a lot of heavy lifting, I guess, left to do to kind of get you \u2013 your people are already using you outside of IT. What do you think has to happen to sort of take that next step to start talking to more line of business heads and CEO types? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, the thing that was striking, Kirk, as I mentioned, because I am new to the enterprise space, I wanted to hear directly from the eyes and ears of customers. And so, I've been on a sort of intensive customer listening tour and had a chance to meet with over 70 different customers over the last 2.5 weeks. And what was striking is that the quality of growth is exactly what you'd want in that our platform is getting pulled into new used cases by the customers themselves. They see this platform as an opportunity to any place there is a workflow or any place where they can divide a service that we can do for them there what we've done in ITSM. And so, you just listen to that, whether they either building their own applications or asking us to build applications. And my observation is what the company has done a very good job on over the last couple years is to recognize that and then build these new products or new services into the platform. So, build the HR, build customer support, build security. And you see the customers appreciating that. And they're asking to see more of our roadmaps, because they're saying, before I take it further and customize it even further, I want to see what your roadmaps are because if I can get it out of your platform, off-the-shelf, out of (15:10) and that's my preference. And so, there was a strong desire to share roadmaps and have them influence our roadmap and I must respond. From what I saw, I think the sales coordination between the sales reps, the product line specialists, our Inspire team and frankly some of our vertical teams in the few verticals that we have them, the coordination seemed strong and then the product teams, we're still the size where our product teams can be directly engaging with customers. And so, I think the path for the future is to continue that path as we get pulled into new used cases and to deepen our sort of a footprint and track record in these new areas. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Great. And just a quick follow-up for Mike. ACV growth in the other category was particularly strong this quarter, Mike. Was there any product or set of products that was very strong for you guys? I realize it's a compilation of products, but just anything that stood out necessarily? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: No. We really saw strength across the board. If you look at our HR ITOM, our security ops that was pretty strong. I would say, our IT business management was very strong and that probably had the highest growth rate year-over-year and that includes performance analytics in that bucket. ITOM was strong, down from Q4. But as we said before, Q4 they tend to be lumpier, bigger deals and Q4 was just such a strong ITOM quarter. So, all-in-all, we're very pleased with our overall ACV performance relative to our plan. And that's reflected in our results, you can see that in the billings and you can see that in the subscription revenue. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Please proceed. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Great. Thank you. Congratulations on a blowout quarter, guys. And welcome, John, looking forward to working with you. I think one thing that we probably spend a little bit of time on, and I think may be underappreciated in the stock is, what you're doing with your channel partners, and how that ecosystem is evolving. We saw a lot of headlines come out this quarter. Would love to hear a little bit about how you're thinking about the channel. What you're seeing there, versus last quarter? And how it's affecting or impacting your go-to-market? And then I have a quick follow-up for Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Actually, I was going to jump in, Sarah, its Mike, and I can answer this... Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Sure, of course. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: ...and given John is relatively new, what I would say is, over the last kind of six to nine months, we've been investing extremely heavy in our whole channel organization to develop both the GSIs and the local partners. And we're starting to see that really pay off. As John mentioned, 62% of our ACV is now influenced by partners and I expect that will continue to increase over time. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And Sarah, what I'd just add is, I did have a chance, as I mentioned, to meet with Jack at Accenture and talk with Mike Lawrie at CSC and the folks at IBM. And I think everyone senses this is a platform that's growing and expanding, and we want to mutually invest in it to ensure that we're providing the training, not just in the ITSM product but in the new products. I heard a lot from customers, asking us to play a more proactive role in ensuring that local, smaller partners are getting trained and vetted as to provide help in the implementation integration, again, largely in some of the newer products. And so you just get the sense that the ecosystem is just starting to pick up and hit a next level of traction and we'll continue to focus on that and invest in it. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. That's fantastic. And just another really quick one for you Mike. Duration, I know that moves around on you guys a lot. What's sort of driving customer decisions on duration? And is there any particular trend there if it's worth calling out for us? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Are you talking in billings duration, or are you talking in contract... Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah, billings. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: ...that whole issue on billings duration is really driven by our partners or customers. Certain of our customers or partners have requirements to capitalize. They will prepay multiple years in advance. And that's exactly what happened with one of our big MSP partners in the end of the quarter that they prepaid it. Well, they agreed they wanted five-year billings in advance and that was the end of the quarter, that cash will flow through this quarter. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, very interesting. Thank you. Congratulations. And welcome on board, John. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you, Sarah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And John, welcome and congrats on a great quarter from me as well. And hey, John, I would assume part of your mandate is that you've been one on the management side that has seen the company go from $1 billion to kind of several billions in terms of run rate. What do you see in terms of process and hardening of processes within ServiceNow to kind of get the company to the next level? Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I'll tell you what attracted me here, which I really liked. It's the foundation to build on, was a couple of things. One, the quality of the platform. This platform is architected the right way. Fred Luddy deserves enormous credit, because as I did my due diligence about this platform and then as I listened to customers, everyone says what a flexible, easy-to-build on and extensible platform it is. The other thing that I found interesting and attractive was the organic growth. A lot of the innovation at ServiceNow has been organically developed. You don't see that very often. Usually, technology companies have a one-hit wonder. And then use M&A to add in new innovations. And because of the way the platform is architected and because of the way Frank and team have really jumped on the HR, customer support, security, business applications, you see organically built innovation and a muscle and a track record to begin to do that. And so, I think with that engine that innovation engine has to be the core of the core of any successful technology organization. And when you got that, then it's a matter of, all right, how do we build out the sales force going from a single product to multi-product? Again, over the last 12 to 24 months, the company has made significant progress on that. That will continue. How do you go from one market to global? Again, strong progress in the U.S., increasingly 30% of our business is outside the U.S. We want to accelerate that global growth, that global development. One of the wonderful things about a technology business is that you can be global instantly. The ability to recruit, develop and retain our team, right? We're becoming a larger team, a more global team. We had to invest a little bit more in process. I'm not a zealot about developing top talent, retaining top talent and we'll continue to do that here. And then lastly, just our customer management. As I mentioned in my remarks, we sort of have grown up through the IT world and are well-known in that world. Our products getting pulled out of IT. We have very good new and emerging reputation. And I think we have an opportunity to elevate and expand our customer relationships. So, we can build strong, deep, enduring relationships that are founded on great product, but also followed through on great service and great delivery. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. And one follow-up for Mike. Mike, your cash flow came in very strong. The cash generation for the company is great. How do you think about usage of cash? I know it's a little bit early, but how are you guys thinking about that? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, as you know right now, we have started doing in that settlement of our issues and we are using a portion of that to pay the taxes on our issues. So, in essence, issue less our issues. Until we are GAAP profitable, we will not look at doing any type of share repurchase. But eventually, that will most likely be what we do first. But obviously, we will be opportunistic in terms of M&A. To-date, there hasn't been anything that compelling. But we will continue to look. And if and when we see something compelling, we'll do something. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Well done. Congrats. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I want to dig in a little bit more on the sort of those other products, I think that's a 50% growth in terms of percentage of new ACVs, one of the most striking figures on the page there. And two questions on that. One, as that becomes a bigger and bigger part of the business, is there a different competitor set that you're facing now that the value proposition is becoming more of like automating all work? And if so, who are the competitors that you're going up against in those deals, number one. And the second part of the question is, and you touched on this a little bit before, John. In terms of getting the sales organization in place to sell sort of outside the IT department against these new competitors, I know we've done a lot over the past year or two. Is there anything significant we should be thinking about in terms of further sales reorganizations as we head into FY 2017? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Keith, it's interesting, because I sort of been training through my 20 years at Bain and my 10 years in the consumer Internet to always start by looking through the eyes of the customer when I'm thinking about a market or a competitive environment. And what was striking in the 70-some-odd conversations I have is that in the eyes of the customer, ServiceNow is addressing a need that the other platforms weren't really designed to do. They think of ServiceNow anytime a workflow is involved. And often these workflows, and increasingly workflows cut across organizational boundaries. And simply put, they want to reduce complexity, simplify and automate and then empower their employees to focus on higher value-added activities, whether it's IT employees or security analysts or CS agents. And so, I was asking him, how would you describe ServiceNow? And I hear words like you guys are the workflow automation engine or the business process optimization platform. And so, customers don't see our platform as competitive with other platforms because they're looking at us through a different set of lenses. And so, in fact what they said is, they want us to more seamlessly connect with the other platforms because they view it as complementary. And so, I guess the lesson I learned from the consumer Internet is, eight years ago, there's all this talk about the big platforms potentially competing with one another. And if you look at what happened, most of them focused on innovation, focused on delivering for their customers and there was ample room for growth for both. And I think we've got that kind of white space. What we do, others are not doing. And if we continue to innovate and continue to drive hard in that direction, we're going to focus on innovating, satisfying our customers and I think when you do that, the rest takes care of itself. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then on any significant sales changes expected for FY 2017? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: I don't think so. Mike? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: No. For 2017, we discussed everything in our January conference call what we're doing, and that was really more just the verticalization of we're starting with the SLED/MED area, State, Local, Education and Medical. And we're not planning on doing anything else as of today in 2017. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: I touched on this a minute ago, but one of the things that was also striking, and I think it's a testament to the culture here and frankly, to Dave Schneider and Kevin Haverty, and the sales team they built rather. But they're just wonderful teamwork of on-the-ground, do I need to bring in a product specialist, do I need to bring in a vertical specialist, do I need to bring in the Inspire team? The ability to bring others in quickly respond, team up, was very noticeable when I was out on the road. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Again, excellent quarter, guys. Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I'll offer my congrats as well to John. I had a question. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier comment on the partner network, and dig a little bit deeper into your expanded relationship with IBM. I mean, how should we think about that helping drive growth? Yet you guys have spent a lot of time talking about Accenture, but IBM to us seems like a pretty interesting opportunity as well. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I can comment what I know, which is still early days, and having had a little bit of exposure to it. But obviously, IBM is a great company and we've very complementary skill sets and capabilities. And so, the dialogs I've been involved in, which admittedly have been few thus far in only three weeks, are talking about how can we go-to-market together? How can we have our product be a compete component of their service offering and how can we jointly serve customers effectively together? And so, I think it's an important partner and one that will grow. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would just add that today, IBM now is our largest MSP that we have in terms of direct revenue from point (29:03). Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great, Mike. And then maybe a quick follow-up. ACV per G2K is trending nicely towards your 2020 target of $2 million, but with the momentum that you're seeing in multi-product sales and new use cases, is it reasonable to think that spend can move closer something like north of $5 million in ACV per G2K customer at some point in the future? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: I like the way he thinks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Now, let's get to the $2 million and then we'll look at taking it up. I don't disagree with you that I think the $2 million is definitely a relatively conservative number, especially when you look at the IT budgets of these large Global 2000. We're just taking a very, very, very small piece of that overall budget. So, I think as we develop and get better, add value selling to our customers beyond the CIO, I think you'll see that number move up. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair. Please proceed. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, and congrats on a fabulous quarter. And John, I'll offer my congrats as well. I wanted to actually start with you around the tour over the last few weeks in terms of the large customers that you've been talking with. I'm just curious when you're having these conversations, what you're hearing from them in terms of their plans around public cloud adoption and sort of where they see ServiceNow fitting into that? And then I've got one follow-up for Mike. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, it's obviously every \u2013 I think probably without exception, every one of them is embracing cloud aggressively. And the far majority, that pattern you say is, there is a consolidation of IT responsibility and technology responsibility inside of these enterprises. So, there is a central group, a central often IT, sometimes they're calling them technology solutions group, but sort of operating on behalf of the enterprise. And you have a spectrum. You have more regulated industries, where they're building, they have significant cloud offerings themselves, private clouds, much like we did at eBay or PayPal or we have at ServiceNow. Many of the banks have this, financial services, healthcare. And they intend to be largely private clouds, because I think they have the scale and capability to do that. On the other end of the spectrum, you obviously have some companies that are moving to the public cloud to the absolute maximum extent possible. And a very few are all the way there, but you see them in process. And then I would say the bulk are in the middle where they intend to have some sort of blend, hybrid cloud, public and private. And one of the interesting new products or interesting areas where we ended up having a fair amount of conversation, we have a Cloud Management product that is helping, because part of what they're saying is, can you help? Is there any way you can help us in this learning journey, in this journey moving to the cloud? And so, our Cloud Management product, I think is one that's going to be we'll be updating it in the Jakarta release, is one there is a lot of interest in and I think there's some real value in that. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess, maybe probably best for Mike on this one. In terms of the ecosystem, it's interesting that the G2K adds have picked up, if you look over the last six quarters versus the prior six quarters, even as your penetration keeps coming up. But I'm just wondering if you'd feel like that's a reflection of the bigger SIs knocking down walls for you. Is it your competitive positioning improving? I guess, what do you attribute, does it feel like it's getting any easier in terms of identifying new opportunities and new G2Ks versus maybe a few years ago? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, what I'll say, it's pretty easy to identify an opportunity with the G2K because there's 2000 of them, so you know who they are. And so, we tend to put people on the ground where those people are \u2013 and so just by virtue of having more people, it makes it easier. And as we've been expanding in APAC and more in EMEA, you're seeing the G2K we're landing there. Remember, these are long sales cycle selling into the G2K. These are not find them in a quarter and close them. Many G2Ks are two-plus years sales cycles. And so, we've pretty good visibility into that. So, it's no big surprise. And I think this will be another good year of G2Ks in total for us. And we have a very large or a big focus on G2K, as you know. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much, and congrats again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I guess continuing on that question on the G2K side. Can you talk about, I guess, APAC specifically? That looks like a pretty good quarter for adds there. Can you talk about how comfortable you are with that traction and momentum continuing in APAC? Would you attribute the success there to? And how are you doing in APAC with adding additional products like you have in the U.S. and in Europe? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, when we roll out a product, we roll that product out in all markets. So, we're not rolling products just out in the U.S. for instance. You can buy our HR product or security ops or customer service in all markets. What I will say is, we're seeing very good traction of Customer Service Management in APAC right now, but as well, you see the other products there. And I will say China is the one market that we really don't have any presence in China. There's a big chunk of G2K there, but we're doing very well in places like Indonesia, in Singapore, Japan is starting to take off for us. Australia has always been a big market there. So, it's a lot of work. I think it was probably a little higher in Q1 than I would have expected out of APAC, but for the year, I feel very good about APAC in terms of new G2K logos. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: In terms of finding people, we don't have any issue finding people over there. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good evening, John. Of course, congratulations and welcome. I look forward to working with you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I had two questions. One, which I think maybe both you and Mike have addressed this around Fed, which obviously has been a strong area for you. But you've recently gotten FedRAMP and there's even more opportunity there. How do you view that opportunity around Fed? And then Mike, I had a follow-up question on another topic. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: To be honest, Michael, I didn't meet in this particular trip with any Federal customers, I don't believe. So, I know the sales team there is strong, and we've got a good track record. But Mike, you may be able to add more color. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. I think Fed has \u2013 it's a huge opportunity in the Federal Government. I will say Q1 is generally not a big quarter with the Federal. We pretty much were right on plan where we expected, but it's not a big number as you know. Q3 will be the big Fed quarter for us, and we have a good pipeline of opportunities for, in particular, Q3. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. And then my follow-up, Michael, is another question on duration. You explained this quarter's greater duration at five-year prepaid. But three things around duration, one, especially with those multiyear prepaid, any pressure increase that we should be aware for discounting there? And then secondly, there's been a countervailing trend, I think, in the industry towards shorter billing duration, and in some cases, less than a year. So, obviously, it net out that way this quarter. But is that increasing if that you're aware of? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, for this one customer in particular that was a five-year prepay. There was no discount to get them to prepay. They insisted on doing it, not us, because they want to capitalize that amount and treat it as CapEx. So, we allowed them to do that. I don't disagree that there is more pressure on shorter billings for customers, especially as you deal more with MSPs where their customers are paying them monthly. But our pricing is all based upon 12 months billing in advance. And so, if customers are going to push for shorter billing terms, they're going to end up paying for it with less discount. And there's absolutely no incentive, by the way, for our reps today to bring in multiple years in advance from a customer. We removed that a while ago. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Mike, thanks very much. Thanks, John. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed. Robert Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Mike, just to be clear on that, as we look at forward billings expectations and how we ramp our models, we shouldn't see an increase to long-term deferred. You've had just kind of the one customer here and then another specific event that happened during the fourth quarter. But as we move forward, the growth should really be in short-term. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: We really forecast the growth all to be in short-term because many of these multiyear billings in advance, we find out about them last minute. They're very hard to forecast. And we give you guys full transparency when they do occur, telling you. Robert Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the clarification there. Number two, if I look at your top 20 new deals and the success you're seeing with multi-products, and 16 of the top 20 was three or more, is there any change in the selling motion that's affording you this success? Are partners contributing to this? Is this doing anything to sales cycles? Would just love more color. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. I haven't seen any noticeable change in sales cycles yet. I will say, as we mentioned, partners now touch 62% of our ACV. So, obviously, they're helping. It's really hard to give you a, to say our X% of our ACV is specific by our partners. As we've talked in the past, these are self-reported numbers. So, I really don't know how good those partner influence metrics are that we give you. All I know is this is definitely not hurting us. Robert Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. John, congratulations. I have a question about, I guess, your strategy or, I guess, your vision that's just may be starting to formulate after you've talked to customers for the IT department, and I guess the addressable wallet there. It sounds like you see a lot of opportunity expanding outside of IT. But I'm wondering what adjacencies or what opportunities you see within the IT department? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, what's interesting is, I see an evolution of the IT department itself. And you sort of see that midstream. Interestingly, I've seen this on the boards I sit on, with the CIOs. And I saw this over the last couple of weeks that you see the CIOs increasingly being drawn to BV, almost the Chief Transformation Officer and that these companies recognize that technology can help transform how they operate, right? And the goal of every company is to minimize the resources consumed in the running of the company and maximize the resources devoted to innovation and your end customers. And so because technology can really help reduce complexity, simplify, automate and empower employees to be more customer facing, the CIO is often the most technology literate senior executive. And so, they're being called on to drive what mild, we would have called business process reengineering, technology-enabled business process reengineering across the enterprise. And so, while on one hand we report HR product, customer support product, security product, you see the CIOs or IT touching these because they're going after them as workflows. And the CIOs have workflow capability. And increasingly, I think in respect to the larger companies, they're looking for the CEO to play that role. The other thing that's I think sort of acting as early kerosene on this trend is just the movement toward intelligent automation, machine learning, deep learning where data and analytics can help automate these processes and help you go from being reactive and responsive to being more predictive and addressing the root cause and remediating it. And the center of where that knowledge often is going to reside inside the enterprise. So, you're not going to build machine learning capability in every department, you're going to say, all right, where's our machine learning? Just as you often have a big data analytics group, you're going to have machine learning or what we call intelligent automation group. And I think that's going to reside in IT. So, I see an expanding role of IT in many of these enterprises. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then a quick follow-up for Mike that he kind of touches on that last point. How is the re-platforming of DxContinuum going? And have you guys put more thought to how you'll embed that into your platform? And I guess price? Do you see opportunity for a new SKU or a price uplift for kind of intelligent capabilities? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, as you know, we just bought DxContinuum early in this year. Our plan is that this will be coming out with our Kingston release, which is the end second half of 2017 towards the end of the year. We're still working on pricing on that. So, stay tuned. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: But what's interesting is, and what I've come to really respect is, I would call, the ServiceNow approached this. We bought DxContinuum, and the first step is to rewrite it into the platform. And so it's part of the platform. It's embedded in the platform, so that all customers can capitalize it and take advantage of it, including all of our products. And then second, instead of it just being Machine-Learning-as-a-Service or AI-as-a-Service, we picked four specific used cases where there's clear need and are applying it to the used cases so that when it gets launched, when it gets announced, acknowledged and then launched, our customers will be able to use that immediately on real world problems that they're facing, within the context of our existing platform, within the context of our existing products. And so, I have a lot of respect for the way that this trend of taking these acquisitions and re-platforming them or rewriting them into the platform because you see that our customers are going to be able to benefit from it quickly. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Please proceed. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Hi, John; hi, Mike. John, I want to ask about your first couple of months, maybe from a different angle. Is there anything you've heard or learned that has made you maybe rethink some of your original assumptions before joining ServiceNow? Or any areas of maybe the original operating plan that that you've discovered, and whether talking to customers or talking to employees? Need a little fine tuning. Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, it's been three weeks. So that we announced it two months ago, I only started three weeks ago. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Of course. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: But Greg, we had a board meeting (45:22) yesterday. I'll just be honest. I said to the board, I'm thrilled. And I'm not just saying it, I said it to them that sure, there's a lot of opportunities to mature and grow and expand as we more naturally deal with the success the company's had, absolutely. But the two things that I appreciate, which are the two things that are really hard to \u2013 you can learn to scale, you can learn to go global, you can learn to evolve, but it's the core of innovation, there's a core innovation capability here. The quality of the platform, the core innovation capability, I think, is real. And that was a real question for me listening to these customers, and they validated that. And then again, great credit to Frank and Mike and the historical culture here. There's no arrogance in this culture. This culture wants to win. They're willing to change. It's not caught up in its ways just because we've had success doing it. And so, there is a real focus on, all right, what do we need to do to get to $4 billion, right? What do we need to do? What do we need to evolve? What do we need to change? And so, with the product and the culture being quite healthy then, everything else is manageable. Do we need to allocate more resource in one country for another? And probably we do. Do we need to be more systematic in our leadership developments? Probably we do. Do we need to continue to evolve our post sale coverage of our customers? We probably do. But all of those things are things other people have done before. And we can draw from best practice. The things that are hard to do when you don't have them are the innovation and the culture. And I'm very appreciative of those two things. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Please proceed. Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Very quickly, you kind of touched on this. But some of the companies that we track have faced a little bit of capacity constraint. That's kind of a good news, bad news on the professional services side of the house, simply because there's been a lot of consolidation. Have you seen any of that? And that's really the only question I had. Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And Richard, do you mean our own professional services organization or... Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: No, partners. Partners. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Partners. I don't know, Mike, if we... Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would say, I've heard this comment from some of our bigger partners and from some of our salespeople. One of the number one concerns from partners is finding people that are trained on ServiceNow already, because they're in such high demand. So, that means they have to hire people and do all the training themselves where they'd rather find some people especially as they want to go into new geos and start practices, because they are finding they have to have people close to where their customers are, because customers are asking that. But we've been hearing that same thing for the last five years, quite frankly. Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Got it. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, we're very focused internally here on training our partners and we will get better at that over time as well too, as well as training our customers. Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Please proceed. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, and great job on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the customer service side of the fence. We're hearing you show up more in RFPs. And Mike, I know when you entered the market 18 months ago, you gave some figures, I think out of the gate, there were a handful of customers, a couple quarters later, you had a couple dozen. I'm just curious, can this become a bigger volume business, or is it still kind of lumpy? And is the focus kind of upper mid-market or G2K or both? Just a little more color around how activity has been trending in this area. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: What I would say is, this is a market that our commercial guys are excited about and they're able to do big deals. We've done a number of big deals in the commercial segment, but as well, we are seeing G2K customers buy our CSM product. So, I think it's applicable across the board. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And from a volume standpoint, is it still kind of early in terms of ramping up volume versus where it was a year ago? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Obviously, it's been growing year-over-year. We had a very good Q1 with that. We actually did close to \u2013 one deal was close to $1 million. And that was a commercial account that we sold that into, I'll say, in Q2. We closed a very nice deal with the G2K already in Japan. So, we're pretty excited about that product. But I'm no more excited about that product than I'm about HR security ops. All of these products standalone can be billion-dollar revenue businesses one day. Now that's quite a ways off, but I do feel pretty positive about those all three businesses. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And Mike, you took up free cash flow margin guidance from 24% to 25% for the year. Was this based on the strong Q1 and strong multiyear payment cash? Or are there other elements driving this? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Mainly through the strong Q1. And we're going to talk more about free cash flow and the puts and takes at our Analyst Day. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks guys for taking my question, and I want to pass along my congratulations as well, John. A question actually to both you guys on just the balance there that you're doing, or how sort of you're focusing on the sales force and go-to-market efforts because clearly you continue to add your G2K customers. But also if you look at the rest of the slides, your ACV per customer is going up and obviously, the customers with multiple products that percentage is increasing. So, how are you balancing just, call it, the ability to up-sell into existing ones and grow AR that way relative to bring on net new? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I'll answer that one, Phil. First of all, I want to clarify it. 73% of our customers are now have bought multiple products, not 93. And what I would say is, the way we balance that is, as we talked about in January of 2015, our whole go-to-market where we segmented our sales force between commercial and enterprise, but we further segmented it between account executives and client account managers and directors. The client account managers and directors are really focused on our existing customers and going back into those existing customers and making sure they renew, they buy more of their existing product, but also that's where we target our new products going to them. And our client account executives are focused on landing those new clients. And what's been very helpful is now having more product in their bag when they go into a customer, if they realize a customer isn't ready for an ITSM replacement right now, because this is not a priority to that department, we can now sell something else and could potentially do an HR replacement to begin or a new HR implementation because many times, we're replacing what was being done in email and we're seeing that same thing with customer service. So that's our go-to-market. What I would say is, 70% to 75% of our net new ACV is really coming from our installed base of customers versus new customers. And we just think over time, that's going to become a bigger and bigger piece of our business as our installed base gets bigger. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Phil, building off of something what Mike just said and something he said earlier on the question about additional Y2K. I was struck. I spent a lot of time with sales reps the last couple of weeks and riding around with them. And a number of them that said, two years ago, I was covering 21 accounts, now we get to focus on three. It's sort of the benefits of scale. The benefits of scale that allows that kind of focus on a Y2K account, which whether it's not yet a customer and we have cases where there's reps, as Mike said, it's a long sales cycle, who are assigned to Y2K, they may not generate revenue for a year, or if they're just covering existing customers. And so, the benefits of scale are noted. As we get larger, that coverage gets easier. Is that Y2K? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sorry about that. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, worry. I was with you. All right. Great. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: A little bit in the past, I guess. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: We're running the acronyms. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. You did certainly take me back on a 1998 June nuclear winter with your Y2K comment. I thought I was 20 years younger for a moment. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, me too. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : There's one question for John, and one for Mike. John, I mean, you had a bit of a different background. As you pointed out, not so much enterprise tech, more consumer tech and management consulting. As you look at that, typically enterprise tech companies, there are enterprise people that are CEOs and certainly, you have a very unique background. How should we think about what are the things that you would be applying there uniquely based on your eBay and management consulting experience that is particularly asserted to ServiceNow and given its evolution? And one for Mike. Mike, sorry to ask this, but how should we think about ASC 606 as to the additional level of disclosures? Any potential changes to your rev rec practice? Thank you so much. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, Kash. On the first, I'll just highlight a couple things. And to be clear, I had the benefit of joining a company that has enormous enterprise experience and expertise. And I think I bring two or three things. One is, I was a CEO. I know what it's like to try to lead a large global enterprise, and I know the fundamental challenge or issue we're trying to address, which is how do you help an enterprise deal with all the complexity the technology has brought and turn technology into an asset, so that the enterprise can focus on where they want to focus, which is the things that drive value for them, which is innovating and delivering for their own customers. And so, in dialogs with our customers already, I feel like I can relate to what the C-suite is looking for from our platform and others. Second, I spent 20 years at Bain and spent a lot of time talking to CEOs about business transformation. That's in essence what Bain did. It didn't do the technology portion of business transformation, but the kind of transformation that we're involved in, our platform is one piece. But the workflow redesign that has to go with it is an important piece. And this is again a source of differentiation versus some of the other technology platforms. If you just kind of automate that process, that doesn't help anyone. And so the way our clients are getting value out of our platform is not just the technology, but also the opportunity to redesign the processes, redesign the workflow so that you can simplify, streamline, automate. And my Bain experience, I think, is in talking to some of our partners, I sort of been on that side of the table at one stage of my career. And then the third area might be something I referred to earlier, which is consumer internet is quite good at delivering user experience. And I think enterprise is behind on delivering comparable user experience. And while ServiceNow has done a nice start with our service portal, there's ample opportunity to significantly improve the user experience, both for employees and for fulfillers. The IT professionals or others that are the administrators of our product. And so, CJ decide who's running product technologies made this as number one priority, and I'll be spending a lot of time and attention on that as well. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And then Kash, on your question on ASC 606. So, first of all, we will be spending a little bit of time at our Financial Analyst Day talking about the impact of ASC 606. You'll also see when we file our Q, which will get filed next week, we will be putting disclosures with a range of the potential impact. We will be adopting that full retroactive starting with the 2016 year, in terms of \u2013 and we will be doing that starting in Q1 2018. As you know that really only impacts us at a revenue line for our on-prem customers or customers who have the right to go on-prem without significant penalty. The revenue impact in 2016 on $1.4 billion, if we had done that, would have been somewhere between $22 million to $27 million on the revenue side. And then you know, there are commissions today, we defer and amortize them over the contract period that gets changed under ASC 606. The impact of that is it's going to push out roughly $23 million to $26 million in expense over a longer period of time. Net-net on an operating margin basis, we'd have a pickup of somewhere between $40 million to $50 million in all of 2016, if we had adopted it January 1. On the disclosure side, we will be disclosing quarterly what's required on the backlog and deferred revenue and then how that backlog is going to roll off into revenue over the next 12 months. And that also, you're required to disclose the impact of how much of your revenue came off your balance sheet from the beginning of the quarter, which we'll talk more about at our Financial Analyst Day. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And certainly here at Bank of America, we look forward to a better user experience relative to legacy, ITSM. Wishing you good luck, John and Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Maybe you can help them become a customer. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions today. So now, I'll be handing the call back over to Mr. Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer, for closing comments and remarks. Sir? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you very much. And I apologize for the analyst who had questions and we didn't get a chance to answer them. But as a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website. Thanks for joining us today. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

We reported another strong quarter today. Our consistent performance underscores our strengths. We have a leading cloud-based platform with innovative technology and an expanding set of product capabilities. We have a strong customer-focused culture that our customers recognize, and our employees and customers value. And we have a global footprint and an expanding partner ecosystem. The result is steady growth of new customers and a consistently high renewal rate, and our strong growth in net new ACV through upsells is driving deeper enterprise integration and expansion of our capabilities. With leading companies across diverse industries, we're becoming a more relevant strategic partner to their digital transformation. Our top two accounts now exceed $15 million in ACV and we now have more than 400 customers doing more than $1 million in ACV with us, including 32 hitting that number in Q2. When I spoke to you last quarter, at the time just three weeks into the job, I shared that my top priority was listening and learning from our customers. That has continued to be my focus. Customer listening and learning are constant operating motions deeply embedded in our ServiceNow culture. We listen, build what our customers want and need and learn from their experiences. And then we repeat that cycle over and over. ServiceNow founder Fred Luddy set that tone from day 1 with his vision of enabling regular people to route work effectively through an enterprise, and our opportunity to fulfill that vision is greater than ever. I met with 100 customers in my first 45 days and I then had the privilege to be with more than 15,000 customers and partners worldwide at our Knowledge17 event in May, which was our biggest Knowledge yet. Knowledge17 was extraordinarily energizing with companies such as GE and Novartis sharing how they are using ServiceNow to transform their businesses. Spending the week engaging with our customers, partners and developers further elevated my excitement about being part of ServiceNow as we create our next chapter. The world is at an inflection point of intense digital disruption, which necessitates that every company focus on digital transformation. Every company I talk to is experiencing this. For IT organizations, CIOs and C-suite leaders grappling with these changes and challenges, we intend to become an indispensible enterprise cloud partner and helping them create the future of work. During my conversations with customers, I'm asking three simple questions, how are we doing? Where can we get better? And what are your biggest priorities? Let me quickly recap what our customers are telling me. First, our customers absolutely love our products and platform and they appreciate how we work with them and do business. ITSM has been a game-changer for our customers and they want to do more with us. That's reflected in our Q2 renewal rate of 97.7%. We have a strong foundation, and as I discussed in my keynote at Knowledge17, our customers want us to continue to lead and innovate with best in-class out-of-the-box integrations and configurations and with more consumer-like end-user experiences. And they want to hear more from us about our roadmap and product vision. These are priorities for us, creating best in-class customer experiences, improving our end user experience and driving customer success. We're already increasing our investment and management focus in these areas. We're also committed to developing a robust highly skilled partner ecosystem. As I've said before, many of the world's largest systems integrators are rapidly investing in ServiceNow's ecosystem. And our partners are critical to the success of our customers, and therefore, to our collective future. Increasingly, we're being leveraged across the enterprise as customers pull our platform and multiproduct capabilities into HR, Customer Service Management and security. In Q2, 58% of our net new ACV came outside of ITSM compared with 40% a year ago. And today, three out of every four customers license more than one ServiceNow product. Our newest products helped drive our strong Q2 results and are being recognized as best-in-class. For example, our HR product addresses a key customer need, which is complementary to leading HCM vendors. This product drove the acquisition of a significant new customer in Q2, a leading airline with net new ACV of almost $3.5 million. And our HR product also resulted in net new ACV of almost $2.8 million with one of our largest existing customers. Our Customer Service Management product also is demonstrating great momentum. In Q2, for example, a leading provider of healthcare technology became a new customer with net new ACV above $1 million solely with Customer Service Management. In addition, the product debuted in Gartner's Magic Quadrant in Q2 and was named by Forrester Research in its Forrester Wave for Customer Service Solutions. That's tremendous recognition for a product in its first year. As we continue to evolve, we also continue to innovate. We ended Q2 with the completion of our Jakarta release, which is now generally available. As we demonstrated at Knowledge17, Jakarta delivers significant performance and user experience enhancements. We continue to be strongly committed to building on our leadership position in ITSM and ITOM, as well as expanding our capabilities for HR, CSM and security. Our Jakarta release also builds intelligent automation into our platform, bringing machine learning capabilities to all of our products and all of our customers for their everyday work. We're solving real challenges for enterprises today while also enabling their transformation to a digital future. ServiceNow facilitates new ways of working, driving greater efficiency and productivity; and that in turn, creates real business value and opportunity for our customers. In closing, we see tremendous opportunity as we drive deeper engagement with CIOs and C-suite executives, increasing our relevance across the enterprise. I'm incredibly proud to be part of this organization and we intend to continue to serve our customers, partners and employees. I look forward to continuing our progress and momentum. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you, John. During today's call, we will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q3 and full-year 2017. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues and revenue growth. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. Total revenues for the second quarter were $472 million, representing year-over-year growth of 38% and an adjusted growth of 40%, or an impact of $7 million. Total billings were $505 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 35% and adjusted growth of 38% or an impact of $12 million. Subscription gross margin was 85%. Professional services and other gross margin was 37%. And overall gross margin was 78%. Excluding Knowledge17 revenue, our professional services and other gross margin was 12% and overall gross margin was 78%. Operating margin was 14%. And free cash flow margin was 20%. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments. In May, we issued $782.5 million of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2022. The primary use of proceeds is to refinance our existing $575 million of 0% convertible notes due upon maturity in 2018. In conjunction with this offering, we purchased a bond hedge and sold warrants to eliminate shareholder dilution up to a $203 stock price. If the stock price increases above $203, the $203 warrant exercise price, only the incremental value above $203 will be dilutive as we plan to settle the principal in cash. Let's turn to guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2017. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues between $488 million and $493 million, representing 36% to 38% year-over-year growth and 36% to 37% adjusted growth or a $3 million impact. We expect total billings between $540 million and $545 million, representing 34% to 35% year-over-year growth, and 34% to 36% adjusted growth or a $3 million impact. We expect an operating margin of approximately 17% and diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 181 million. For full-year 2017, we expect total revenues between $1.091 billion and $1.911 billion representing 37% year-over-year growth and 37% to 38% adjusted growth, or a $2 million impact. We expect total billings between $2.271 billion and $2.281 billion representing 34% to 35% year-over-year growth and 35% adjusted growth, or an $8 million impact. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, professional services and other gross margin of 15%. Total gross margin of 77%, operating margin of 16% and free cash flow margin of 25%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 179 million for the year and now expect to add approximately 1,300 net employees in 2017. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Congrats on the strong results. John, the mix of new ACV from non-ITSM and ITOM products, I believe is a record at 39% versus I think what was a record last quarter of 34% and in your prepared remarks you talked security, HR, Customer Service deals, but it really was that $1-million-plus Customer Service Management win that was really interesting to me as a new customer win. Can you give a little bit more detail on why they chose ServiceNow versus other vendors and how they think about expanding into other areas of your platform? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sure, Matt. Well, obviously Customer Service Management is a huge market and the area where our product has a real sweet spot is in situations where a customer is dealing with a large volume of inbound contacts and/or that they've got to deal with root causes to reduce the human interaction. So the kind of situations we're strong at is when you take those high inbound volumes, much like you get inbound incidents to an IT helpdesk or a HR case management. You've got high inbound volume and you want to automate how you respond, creating as much self-help as possible and the way you do that is to get to what the root cause of the inbound incidents are. And so our product is very well suited to that to help identify what the root cause is, so that you can then remediate without a lot of expensive human interaction. And so that's the kind of use case where our product plays well. And it's turning out to be an entr\u00e9e point in the commercial market and many customers and in this case, in the enterprise market. And then, as you know, once we've sort of landed an account, the opportunity to expand laterally into our other products is much easier. So it's, in many ways, using the same functionality we have in our other products applied to a CSM use case. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. Maybe just a quick follow-up, you guys made an acquisition of Qlue, kind of building on the DxContinuum acquisition. Clearly customers are asking for more machine-learning capabilities, intelligent automation, predictive capabilities, but I guess, can you help define how this functionality helps with new wins, and maybe the monetization effort of that? Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: What's interesting is what we hear from both existing customers and new customers are that there is a huge amount of new technologies out there, and they're having trouble keeping up; what are the ones they need to pay attention to, what are the ones they need to be building themselves. And what we're saying is that there is certain functionality that we will take responsibility for accessing and acquiring and make it easier for them to use. So, machine learning, we started with DxContinuum, where we bought DxContinuum and we're integrating machine learning into our platform, so that all products and all customers can access it, and therefore the customer only has to worry about using their data, they don't have to worry about acquiring their own machine-learning capability. Virtual agent technology, which is the way to obviously automate and streamline a response whether it's an IT response, an HR response or CSM response, is another technology, and by buying Qlue, we'll sort of repeat that same formula of re-platforming it into our platform, recoding it into our platform, and making it available to them. So, they don't have to buy their own chatbot capability or other virtual agent capability. And we'll continue to do that. We're looking at a number of other technologies, all of which I characterize as being complementary to the core thing we do, which is helping them automate their workflows, improve the ability to have self-help and provide better experiences for their employees and customers. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Well done. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And thanks for taking my question. Given the volatility you've seen over the past couple of quarters and your sequential ACV growth per G2K customer, can you speak to the dynamics of customer acquisition and what it's contributing and how follow-on plays out? Because your customer acquisition has obviously been running well ahead over the last couple of years, but we've seen that variability I guess in the ACV number. So any color would be appreciated. Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, so, Rob, it's Mike here. So, if you recall when we laid out our model, that 4% is an average growth quarter-over-quarter, obviously it's not the reality of the world; this is not a spreadsheet that it continues to grow through 2020. We do see seasonality. You saw that last year. Typically the second half of the year is a much bigger upsell quarter. So we do expect that the second half of this year, and we see that already with the number of contracted upsells that have closed already, as well as what is sitting in our pipeline of opportunities that are heavily weighted towards upsell, so I feel very good about that number still. The other thing that weighs down upon that number when we came up with that 4% three years ago, that was based upon adding 20 Global 2000 per quarter; we continued to add well above that. And if you remember, our average Global 2000 we land typically is much lower than what people think. If you look at last quarter, it was $300,000, the quarter before it was $200,000 and that is very typical. And it's once we land them, then they continue to grow from there. So, we feel very good about what we're seeing there. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is there any different dynamic given a lot of the incremental Global 2000 obviously are likely to come out of APAC and other versus your penetration in North America and EMEA, which are both 50% or greater at this point. Is there a different ACV that you experience with APAC and other geos? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: No. I have actually already closed two Global 2000 this quarter in APAC that are greater than the average of our Global 2000 today. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and very nice quarter. A question for John, when you talked to us at Analyst Day, you were basically talking about, hey, listen, my number one job here is listening, and you've done a lot of listening and talked to a lot of customers. Is it still too soon to be thinking about any changes that you'd want to make to sort of distribution, or how you guys are planning on go-to-market from what you've learned or is it just sort of you guys are operating pretty well as is, so you're going to let well enough alone in the near term? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, Keith, I think \u2013 I don't know if you'd characterize this as go-to-market, but we are increasing our focus on the full customer lifecycle, right. We have a world-class sales force and a world-class go-to-market motion, and I don't see any need for significant change in that. In fact, I really admire \u2013 I'm struck by how nicely our sales team has layered in product specialists and layered in the industry focus, as well as continued to re-cut territories to serve customers and more deeply penetrate in our sort of pre-sales through sales motion. The area where we're increasing our focus is in the sort of full customer lifecycle, post-sale, all the way through renewal where what I heard from customers was, help me implement and help me get maximum value out of the product, and then help me translate that into business value, that we can demonstrate. And the interesting thing is our products do drive real business value, right, we automate workflows, which is sort of at the root cause of productivity. But what we are going to do is put a little more focus on customer success, so that we're capturing and documenting and codifying the business value that gets created, which helps a CIO or an IT department within their organization demonstrate the value they are driving inside their company and frankly helps us on upsells, on price realization and on landing new accounts. So, I would say the more focus on the full customer lifecycle particularly post sales through renewal. We already have a number of things going on there, but we're trying to bring them together in a more cohesive and powerful way, both pre-sale and post. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. And if I could sneak in one follow-up. We've heard a lot last year about sort of increasing partner commitments if you will and more partners coming to the ecosystem. Is it too soon to be seeing the results of that, of them sort of driving more business for you guys? Is that still in development, are you starting to see those results? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Both. I think I'd say we see some results but our partners are clearly playing a very important role in influencing deals, particularly with G2K customers. We think roughly two-thirds of our net new ACV was influenced by partners, roughly a third was sourced by partners, and so we're already seeing that impact and certainly our top partners are quite important partners. That said, I was meeting with a CIO of one of our top partners this morning in our EBC, and as we talk it feels to me like there is still opportunity where we can more comprehensively and effectively work together to both bring our joint products to market. Every company is struggling with digital transformation and that takes both great software and great process reengineering support to sort of implement it. We're talking about even tighter collaboration on product development and sharing R&D and roadmaps together. And so, I feel like there is still additional opportunity to get even more mutual benefit out of our top partner relationships. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks very much. John, you mentioned a couple of the bigger HR wins this quarter and it seems to us that more of your customers and partners are talking about your HR onboarding offering. And I notice you all are also a Diamond sponsor at the HR tech show this year, so which would seem to indicate you guys want to get the message out there. So could you just talk about the opportunity you see for ServiceNow around the HR function and what do you think has to happen to sort of realize that opportunity? And this really quick follow-up for Mike. Mike, obviously, a really good quarter, but you also took up guidance for the back half of the year, which would seem to indicate you feel good about the trends heading into the third quarter. Is there anything else we should sort of read into the guidance going up for the back half of the year from a billings perspective? Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, Kirk. On your first question on, what you described as HR, here is what I see, and I think we're experiencing it. The change is that virtually every company and every CEO is making modernizing the employee experience a priority, right? Millennials are demanding that they get the same kind of experiences at work as they are getting at home. And so almost every company is saying how can we provide a more compelling employee experience at work. And that's the macro trend that's creating the macro demand. Now, what's interesting, when you think about it as employee experience, employee experience is a lot more than just HR. It's their full end-to-end experience and that's where we excel. So take employee onboarding, employee onboarding is a multi-departmental experience, right, it touches, you've got to get your badge from facilities, you've got to get your desk \u2013 sorry, badge from security, your desk from facilities, you've got to get your laptop from IT, you've got to deal with finance, you've got to deal with compliance, you have to deal with HR. So it's more than just an HR experience, it's the full end-to-end experience. And that's where our platform and our capabilities are really strong. Same thing with HR case management, same thing with employee portal which is by definition a multifunctional portal. And so our sweet spot is something that can help drive end-to-end good experiences, workflows, the way talk about it, to improve the employee experience. And so that's what's driving really strong demand for our HR products and we think that's going to continue, and I'll note, as I have several times, that is very complementary with what the HCM providers are providing. It's not in competition with them, but very complementary to provide the best end-to-end working together, we provide the best end-to-end employee experiences for our customers. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And then, Kirk, on your question with regards to billings, the uptick in our billings guidance for the full year is really a result of the overachievement in our net new ACV in the quarter coupled with the opportunity we see on the subscription side. FX also impacted that very positively. You see where the euro is at relative to where it was when we gave guidance last quarter, but on top of that there is a negative headwind that we did take down our professional services slightly by about $6 million in revenue which directly flows through the billings. And that's really more because as we've talked about quite some bit for the last couple years, we're really shifting more of our professional services, the implementation work to our GSIs and partners, because we really want to focus more on the high-level solution architect, the deployment of our new products and training. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Super. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Question for John. Just on M&A, the company has been very, I'd say, measured in acquisitions that have been done and I'm wondering you've been \u2013 your quarter under your belt. Is there a need in some of these markets \u2013 it feels like your priority has to be on driving the broader opportunity. Is there a need to expand that M&A activity as you look at some of these markets that are maybe further afield from your core in IT and you might want to jumpstart or otherwise accelerate the efforts there? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Walter, I think one of the real strengths of the company has been this practice of taking literally, virtually every single acquisition and re-coding it into the platform. So that we do have one platform that all applications and all customers can pull from. And the thing that's striking about this company is the organic innovation that we've been able to pull off. And so whether it's the new products around ITOM, around HR, customer support, and security, that organic innovation is what's driving our growth. And that is enhanced by having one platform. When you have multiple platforms, you get more complexity, you get less organic innovation. And so I think this formula of saying, let's look for acquisitions that may bring a functionality, a capability such as machine learning or virtual agents or the ITapp capability that we're now using in cloud management, bring those in, re-code them into our platform, so they're natively available, which then drives a very high organic innovation flywheel. And as long as that's working, there is no need to disrupt that momentum, we feel like there is very good growth opportunity with our existing application set. The other interesting thing is we've got a whole host of applications or a whole host of use cases where customers are already using our platform on workflows and use cases that we don't have an out-of-the-box functionality with, and we will over time, evaluate which of those we want to bring into our core product line. And so, I see a pretty strong innovation pipeline that's not dependent upon M&A. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, and congrats on a great quarter guys. John or Mike, I have a question on customer feedback on the Jakarta release. What type of feedback are you getting from them? What are the kind of features that partners and customers are most excited about? And in particular, if you can talk about the adoption, are you expecting the adoption of Jakarta to be faster or slower than the previous releases? Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, the first thing we should say it was only released generally available last week so \u2013 but clearly the feedback from Knowledge and since then has just been very, very strong on a number of dimensions, whether it's the enhancements that Farrell made to ITSM to make the pre-configuration that makes integration and upgrades more easy and allows faster time to value, or additional functionality like software asset management or cloud management that's being released with Jakarta, two new products, great examples of organically extending our platform to address a key need in our customer software. They are having an explosion of different software inside and managing that software tracking, and managing; it's a key need and our software management, asset management product does that. And then they have got multiple clouds and how they manage the clouds is a growing and new and emerging need, and our cloud management product and cloud management capability is helping to address that. So, there are a number of both, I'd say refinements to existing products and new features and functionality in Jakarta. There is a lot of excitement about it. But to be honest, they're just now upgrading and implementing them, and we'll be very aggressive at ensuring that our customers get real value out of those. Anything you would add, Mike? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: No, I'll just add, remember, we deal with very large enterprise customers and feedback on new releases, generally when they adopt a new release, they put it into a test environment to make sure they test out everything before they go live. So it generally takes a number of months after the release before we get real feedback. I will say just internally software asset management is the one that interests me. We adopted that within the first couple of weeks of doing it, we had a software audit that came in and saved \u2013 we're a small company, $150,000. So, I was pretty pleased with that, because we weren't using it, I don't think we would have saved that at all. We are already seeing in software asset management, we've seen a $500,000 deal for that. So, I'm pretty excited about that and I'm excited about what we've done with both the Security Ops with the Trusted Circles, as well as the BrightPoint acquisition is now native, and we talked about that at our users conference. But also what we're seeing in HR and improvements we've done there, and the fact that in our CSM product, we now have communities inside there built into that. So, a lot of excitement across the board with our entire portfolio. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks guys. And congrats on the quarter. I guess a couple from me, first either for John or Mike, I was hoping you could unpack the 39% ACV a little bit. You've got a number of products in there HR, Security Ops, CX and others as well. I'm just wondering if there is any one that dominates that in terms of what you saw in Q2 and if you look at the pipeline, if it's pretty balanced. And then specifically for software assets, since you just mentioned it Mike, where will that go in terms of these different buckets and what does the pricing look like for that. And then I've got a follow-up? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So we continue to see strength in all of our emerging products. As John called out, HR was a very, very strong quarter for us and I would say second followed Customer Service. ITOM was a very big quarter, I know you're not calling out that, we are very pleased with that we saw in ITOM. And then I would say third was customer or Security Ops was third. We continue to see a lot of excitement and pipeline built within the Security Ops product, but HR and CSM are driving bigger deals for us. In terms of software asset management that will be disclosed as one of our emerging products, that other (34:59) going forward. And the pricing on that is really based upon the number of servers that you have out there. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Super helpful. And then on the guide for Q3, it looks like particularly on the subscription billing, it seems abnormally strong from a sequential standpoint, I think you're guiding for something like 8% growth and last year I think the guidance was more like 2%. You talked a little bit about this, but is that just a abnormally normally strong start to Q3, is it timing of renewals or what else is there to think about in terms of seasonality and that's it? Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: It's both. It's a lot of backlog not just renewals that is going to be built as well as the strength that we see in our pipeline of opportunities. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Question for John. If I'll \u2013 now that you've had a good few months in the company, and if you look at the vendors like it's the highest renewal rate I see in SaaS, it's very, very strategic. What is the feedback that you get from, in talking to all the guys that you know in industry that are not yet customers in terms of, if you have engagement with them, like what are they thinking about you versus other guys, and what's kind of the dialogue that you have around that one? And a quick question for Mike then is, if I look, in Q2 you did beat us quite a bit on operating margin but again in Q3 was slightly lighter. Was there a timing thing in terms of cost, et cetera that we should be aware of? Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, Raimo, I've sort of struck 90 days in on sort of two levels about what customers, and as you say, not-yet customers. Obviously within every IT department, ServiceNow is very well known, and for those that are not yet customers, often they either have a renewal of their existing provider that's coming up, and I think we'll have an at-bat, if you will, in almost every one of those cases, or they haven't yet gotten to using software to structure unstructured workflows, and the impetus is on us to demonstrate to them the business value and productivity value that they will get from using our ITSM and core IT products. And so, I think we continue to add new logos simply because where we do focus our energies and effort, we are successful at penetrating. The other observation I'd make is outside of IT and the C-suite, in some ways, ServiceNow is one of the best-kept secrets in world in that our brand awareness outside of IT is not what it, I think, it can be. And in particular as I said earlier the brand awareness of how we drive business value, how we drive productivity, how we drive an enhanced and improved employee experience, how we drive improved end customer experiences where our platform is being exposed to end customers, that is I think an opportunity for us to raise our visibility and raise our awareness. And it's one of those wonderful situations where the substance is ahead of the perception. And so I think one of the things we're going to be doing is trying to bring the awareness and perception in line with the substance and I think we'll \u2013 when people understand what it is we do and what it is we can do and how it can drive business value for them, all it will do is enhance what is an already strong sales motion. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And Raimo, that ties in partly to the answer to your question. So the first thing in Q2, we did have overachievement on the operating margin, that was partially due to timing of expenses, but namely some of the linearity within the hiring; there were also some expenses that got pushed out into Q2. But what we did make a decision and this is part of the thing what John just talked about is we are going to try to elevate our brand awareness at a company level, as well as at a certain product level with some of our emerging products, because we see the opportunity. And that's reflected in our operating margin, which is still within the guidance that we gave for the beginning of the year. We're still confirming 16% operating margin for the full year and on top of that, we're adding more employees too as we're seeing the opportunity to invest more heavily both in our sales organization and sales and marketing to go after these opportunities that we're seeing. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Congrats. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter guys and thanks for taking my questions. John, the first one for you. You're seeing a lot of strength in your Forbes 2000 adds, another 29 this quarter which is up year-over-year and sequentially and it looks pretty good across the globe, but I wanted to dig into some of the regional performance and what you're seeing in the pipeline in both Europe and Asia-Pac? And then Mike, I wanted to follow-up with you on ASC 606, I'd love to hear where we are and what we should be expecting from you on that accounting change? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So actually Sarah, I'm going to jump in right now kind of the Global 2000. Yes, we had very good strength across the Global 2000, 29. We continue to see in our pipeline a large pipeline of new opportunities, but in the past quarter, Asia-Pac was a little light on landing new Global 2000; however, as I did just mention, we did have two that closed already quarter-to-date this quarter. So you do see variability. I can't stress enough, these Global 2000 sales are extremely long sales cycles. We see that globally; that's not unique to any one region. As an example, we landed two Global 2000s this past quarter that were as new customers, that were five-plus-years sales cycles. We up-sold another Global 2000 where we finally got the mothership that they are committed to land, once again that was a four-plus-year upsell, they were a very small customer, and are now continuing to grow. So, I'm not concerned about the strength in Global 2000 adds in any one geo in any particular quarter, looking at it more on an annual basis. And we do see very good distribution both historically and what's in our pipeline going forward. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And the thing I'd just add to that from a more of a macro perspective is one of the things that we look at is cloud adoption. Cloud adoption differs by country. And so there are a couple markets, that our enormous markets where cloud adoption has been a little behind but is now beginning to kick in, Japan being one of them, and a huge market; cloud, a little bit more slowly adopted. Now, we're beginning to see it's more common among the large Japanese multinationals and leading companies to be embracing cloud with some of the same fervor that's being done in the U.S. and other places. Similarly, Germany. Germany is a huge market with a lot of very large companies and cloud adoption, Germany has been just a little bit more slow for all sorts of reasons, privacy, security, and others, but we're beginning to see some early signs there of that market moving along a little bit. So I think, that's another positive indicator on the global expansion horizon as more and more countries begin embracing cloud with the same vigor that the U.S., UK and others have. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And then on the second part of your question, Sarah, on ASC 606. I did spend quite a bit of time at our Financial Analyst Day going over ASC 606 in May; was not planning on giving any update right now. We continue to move through with the adoption of that and in October call, I'll update people on the impact of that. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right, that's perfect. Thank you guys so much and congrats on the quarter. Appreciate it. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Mike, question for you on free cash flow. I remember super strong in Q1. And you warned us all that that was a little bit of an unusual cash flow generation quarter, but 2Q solid as well actually and through the first half, you're now running at 28% free cash flow margins. Your full-year guide is 25%. So, what would cause the free cash flow margins to compress in the second half given that your operating margins should likely be up year-over-year? Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, believe it or not, Q1 is generally one of the strongest quarters. And if you do look on our investor deck we just posted that we did go over with you guys at our Financial Analyst Day page 20, Q1 is so high because of the amount of contracts that we have that start on December 31 through January 1 of the cash flows through in Q1 when you do that billing. Yes, Q4 is a strong quarter. Q3 has a negative impact of the employee stock purchase plan because we used a fair bit of cash that we've collected in the previous six months that goes out. That's probably the biggest impact and as a reminder we did tell people for the full year, if we're in high growth, we're going to add 0% to 1% in free cash flow margin and we're continuing to deliver above that this year. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Good. Thanks, Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Can you hear me? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I'd like to drill down a little bit on Keith's question about go-to market and the need for change there. I know you said that you're in pretty good shape but there have been a really big expansion in the amount of products and in the areas in which you have products, including in areas like infrastructure where you're doing more automation. So, what makes you feel that you have the right structure exactly what it is and how do you scale out and broaden the scope such that you can make sure that you deliver all those products and sell them? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, Michael, maybe both of us can comment on this. Different points of view because \u2013 I'll just say as a relative newcomer, it's not that we \u2013 I don't think we have it all figured out, but I am really impressed with Dave Schneider, Kevin Haverty, our sales leadership team of how they're continuing to evolve it each year. And they're evolving it by, as I said earlier, adding product sales overlay, adding some of the verticals, how they're expanding geography. And they're doing it in a way where customers don't see a lot of dislocation, and that's not an easy thing to do. The other thing that's striking to me is that as we get larger, it's allowing more focus on our customers. So, we have two huge wins, the two large wins in Q2, where as Mike said, things that took many years, and we went back and asked the reps three years ago how many accounts were you covering, and in both cases, they were covering 60 to 80, somewhere between 60 and 80 accounts. And both cases, those were \u2013 the very same reps this year are only covering 10 accounts. And what that allows them to do is to walk the hallways, even if it's a non-paying customer, it's a potential customer, they're walking the hallways, they're understanding those customer's needs, they're demonstrating our capabilities, they're building relationships and so the value of scale is allowing a greater customer focus, which helps with existing customers as well as helps us penetrate new, large customers, because we simply have more sales time per customer. And so we will continue to evolve more in 2018, 2019, 2020 as we grow our product portfolio and grow our scale. So, I think, what I was commenting on earlier is just that, that dynamic ability to do that in a way that deepens relationships and does not create discontinuity is what's certainly striking to me as impressive in my early months. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would echo what John said, and I would also say is that, obviously, what we've been doing has been working, as you see the expansion outside of ITSM in our emerging products. Obviously we continue to look at this; there may be more vertical focus later on down the path, but we don't expect any changes in 2017. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, John. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. The first one is if you could provide any color on sort of commercial sales team performance versus the enterprise sales team performance. And then one quick mechanical question; Mike, I noticed there is a uptick in the contract term lengths for new customers and I was just wondering if there is anything behind that? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So we had very good performance of the commercial team, the commercial team I think hit 106% of their number. We had a very good quarter as I mentioned, the overachievement in our net new ACV is kind of what's driving billing. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing across the board with both enterprise and commercial. On your comment on average contract term, not that much to read into that, other than it was a very strong Global 2000 quarter with 29 that we added, the G2Ks tend to like longer-term contracts to lock in pricing for a period of time. As a reminder we do try to incent our sales force to sell a three-year contract. We've had quarters that have kind of been in that 33% before; I don't find it that unusual, the 33.9%. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J&PMorgan (sic) [JPMorgan] (49:27). Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. JPMorgan. Just one quick one, I missed it if you said it, but any color that you can give us in terms of the experience in demand by vertical industry in the quarter and specifically government as we head into the government's final fiscal quarter? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: We saw strength across the board financials, we saw it in the healthcare, we did some very nice government deals this past quarter. So no one industry to call out, I would say it was strength across all. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Hi. Congrats on the quarter and pardon the directness of the question. With the mix of business the way it shook out, the non-ITSM, was it as you expected going into Q2, and if so, what does the sales pipeline of potentially new business look like, does that reflect the change in your business mix? Maybe if I am over-thinking this, do you expect conversely ITSM to rebound because I think there was at least one quarter last year when ITSM was a little bit sluggish and I can remember Frank saying that it's going to bounce back, and it did. I am wondering which of the two ways to interpret the mix of results, because if it is the former I believe that the value drivers for ITSM are very different from the value drivers for non-ITSM; therefore what we have come to depend upon, the predictability of a replacement cycle of all service management systems that gives way to a different kind of machinery (51:09) sales, increasing mix of your business from machinery (51:12), customer support, analytics, HR et cetera. So if that's the case \u2013 I'm sorry for the complicated question but if that's the case then how are you going to be thinking about how you've organized your sales force because the selling skills and the motions are very, very different. Sorry for the long-winded question. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Kash. So first of all, those percentages are of ACV, we're actually not telling you with the actual ACV is and what I will add is of the 29 Global 2000, 28 of them were ITSM. I can't stress enough, ITSM is what lands us in the door. And once we get into ITSM, then we're able to upsell. And we are continuing to see strength in ITSM. If you look at our Jakarta release, we are very focused on a lot of the enhancements we are doing within ITSM, but I don't disagree with you on value. The IT is a very different value than HR and Customer Service and we are seeing we can extract more value on the HR and Customer Service. But if you don't have ITSM, you don't have that opportunity. So we do see a very good pipeline of opportunity in the second half of the year across the board. I do expect the emerging products \u2013 as you'd expect, we're investing heavily in these \u2013 will continue to grow at a bigger pace than the ITSM, but we are seeing growth in ITSM. And ITSM is the bulk of our revenue today, and will be the bulk of our revenue for quite some time. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And Kash, what I'd add to that is it's striking to me is that when you actually get inside these customers and talk to them, they view us as a platform. I mean, this is not a series of disparate products that are unrelated to one another. They, in many, if not most, cases have embraced our platform. And even though the decision-maker in HR, HR product or security or CSM is not the CIO explicitly, the CIO and IT does play a role both because we've established credibility and payback in IT. And IT is involved in the implementation outside of IT as well. And so there is a \u2013 it's not quite as far afield as it may look from the outside in that it's from the same platform the products do. There is a high degree of overlap on what the product functionality is and the role of IT is a real asset and our credibility with IT within the company is a real asset. Kash Rangan - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much, John and Mike. Congratulations again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, thank you. Hey, guys. I have a couple questions, but first for John. What's your philosophy on ISPs and expanding that opportunity. Are you doing anything to increase your investment on third parties building on ServiceNow? And then a quick one maybe for Mike, how are sales cycles trending year-over-year in your non-ITSM business? I guess I'm curious as you build up more awareness around these solutions and get them reference customers if you're starting to see those come down? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. On our platform, our platform as I said a minute ago is a huge asset. And what our customers tell us is internal developers find it easy to build on, fast to build on, extensible quite easily. And so that's an obvious opportunity to open that up and make that more available to ISVs and third-party developers. Then as we grow and expand, that's a natural way to grow and expand our functionality as well, whether it's more vertical specific requirements that ISPs can develop or new markets, new use cases. And so we're absolutely investing and making sure the platform is easy to build upon as possible. We have our store. It's relatively nascent but there is I think over 200 now applications in the store and that's growing. And so it will be a continued and increasing area of focus and investment as we go forward. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I'll also add, Jesse, we did make four investments last quarter in ISVs that are building their businesses on ServiceNow's platform. The other thing on your other question on sales cycles, we continue to see really no change in the ITSM sales cycle; remember that's a replacement cycle. I talked about earlier how long it is in the Global 2000, it's still nine-plus-month on average initial sales cycle. We are seeing some shorter sales cycles in some of the emerging products, in particular HR and Customer Service, don't know if that's a trend that will be going forward, but we do see in some of the newer products shorter sales cycles and there are some shorter sales cycles on upsells and we are very much focused too on having contractual upsells with customers right now as well. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, bye. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. You all touched on a lot on the HR, ITOM, Customer Service, but hoping you could give us some flavor for what you're seeing in the IT security management, your analytics, because obviously the growth in that other ACV line has been really impressive this year? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I think all the products are doing well. We just chose to flag and highlight the ones that stood out, but Security Operations is obviously a huge market, we're just going through tremendous high demand, and our product is a natural complement to many of the other products in that market and is addressing one of the most fundamental dilemma CESOs have which is an explosion of inbound contacts, whether it's from their existing nodes or it's the Internet of Things, there's just an explosion of inbound contacts and the ability to address or remediate those in as an automated way as possible so that they put their human energies on the ones that really matter is a key need. And so, the Security Operations product continue to sell well. Two of our top five deals in the quarter included security and it's a natural add-on product along with the ITSM and ITOM. And similarly analytics had a strong quarter. It was included in 17 of our top 20 deals. So frankly the highest count of all products and it was a strong contributor to net new ACV, it's not as big a line item so to speak. But it's very prevalent and most customers are buying analytics along with the other products. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. And then, Mike, just one quick housekeeping item. I think last year the net expense associated with NOLs (58:32) was $11 million. I'm wondering if you'd give us that for this year as well? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: The net expense is somewhere in these $15 million to $17 million. I don't remember exactly the amount going through there. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Richard Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. John, this may be a question for you, it's a short question but maybe a little harder to answer. So if you kind of think about when Salesforce really kicked it into another gear is when they became kind of a strategic partner to their customers on the revenue side, and you guys have touched on this on and off throughout the conversation tonight. To what extent do you think you guys are there and if you are not what do you need to do to get there? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I think we have \u2013 Richard, I think it's an excellent question. And I think my early read is, we have all the potential to get there in that there is clear demand in every company is dealing with digital transformation, every company needs to find productivity in their operations, so that they can take that productivity savings and reinvest it in innovation with their own customers. And fundamentally at the end of the day what we do is by automating workflows we're driving productivity, we're helping improve the employee experience. And so I think the fundamentals are there. I think we can do a better job of capturing the business value we're creating; codifying, capturing it and communicating it. And interestingly our customers are asking for that. IT is typically not talked about what they do inside the company in business value terms; they're increasingly being asked to do so. And so just as I think you talked about sales force when that focus became un-measurable incremental revenue, they became a more strategic partner, in our case driving greater productivity, driving greater employee experience, better employee experience which as I said earlier is a core requirement and demand for most customers and driving better end-customer experience. And yes, you heard actually from GE talk about that at our Knowledge where we're being pulled to the end customers. And so those are measurable business outcomes that we're helping to contribute toward, those are C-suite kind of issues, and I think we're well-positioned to capture and codify what we're doing linking it to that, and that will continue to make us more relevant and strategic both to IT and beyond. Richard Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Michael Scarpelli for any closing remarks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So sorry for those who weren't able to ask a question, unfortunately we're at the top of the hour. So, as a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

We closed 22 deals with ACV greater than $1 million, and performance was strong across every geography. Each region achieved or outperformed our target for the quarter, and all are tracking ahead of plan for the full year. Our consistent performance underscores our strengths. ServiceNow is a leading cloud-based platform with a strong portfolio of applications. Our innovative technology and expanding set of product capabilities enable customers to accelerate their digital transformation and simplify and streamline the way people work. Our customers also value and recognize our strong customer-focused culture and our commitment to ensuring their success. This continues to be reflected in our strong renewal rate. And we have a diverse global footprint and strong partner ecosystem. We now serve more than 800 G2K customers representing more than 40% of the world\u2019s 2,000 largest public companies and we added 35 customers in the quarter, doing more than one million in ACV with us, and this includes our largest federal deal ever at $7 million in ACV. Federal represents a significant growth opportunity for us in addition to our continued G2K expansion. Throughout the quarter, I continue to spend much of my time engaging with customers around the world, listening and learning. And whether at a dinner with CIOs in Tokyo or Frankfurt or at the NowForums I headed in Amsterdam, London and New York, the conversations are consistent. CIOs are grappling with intense digital disruption and the need to accelerate the digital transformation of their companies. They\u2019re seeking the right partners to go with them on that journey. For our current and future customers, we intend to become a trusted cloud partner in creating the future of work. We\u2019re investing in our customer success capabilities, building skills and processes to be a strategic partner for our customers along every stage of their digital transformation journey. Our customers love our products and our platform. Experience the benefits of ITSM and other applications, their companies have implemented, they see the potential of our platform to do more. And as I\u2019ve shared with you before, our customers want us to continue to lead and innovate with best-in-class out of the box integrations, and configurations and consumer-like end-user experiences. And they want to hear more from us about our roadmap and product vision and those are exactly our priorities; creating best-in-class customer experiences, and driving customer success. In the quarter, we saw strengths of our platform and product portfolio. Our flagship ITSM product had a very good quarter, with ITSM being include in 17 of our top 20 deals and our platform was included in 15 of those deals. In HR, our employee services experience product led three of our top 20 new customer deals and our employee services product is now being used by 119 G2K customers. And customer service is also seeing great momentum. Our customer service management product landed two million-dollar plus deals and we\u2019re excited to roll out machine-learning capabilities for customer service management in our upcoming Kingston release. Last but not least, our security operations product landed its first deal over $1 million. Underscoring our commitment to delivering best-in-class experiences, we announced during the quarter the acquisition of design firm Telepathy. Adding this talented team significantly enhances our design capabilities and they\u2019re already partnering with our existing software development teams to create great customer experiences and offering great end-user experience not only means delivering great user design, but also requires delivering great mobile experiences. Strengthening our mobile capabilities is a priority for us and we\u2019re already good at delivering enterprise mobile experiences. But the standard today is no longer an enterprise mobile experience. The new standard is delivering the same kind of great consumer mobile experiences that we enjoy in our everyday lives. So, we aim to give customers these great mobile experiences at work and I\u2019m delighted with the announcement today of our intent to acquire SkyGiraffe. This acquisition gives us a world class team to make mobile native to our platform in 2018 and to deliver amazing consumer quality mobile experiences to our enterprise customers. All of our package applications, including ITSM will be available in a native mobile format. And so ServiceNow customers and partners will be able to easily build mobile apps in days, not months with our tools and templates. Our acquisitions of Telepathy and SkyGiraffe for design in mobile, along with our acquisitions earlier this year of DxContinuum for machine learning, and Qlue for virtual assistant technology demonstrate our strategic approach to M&A. We will continue to invest in teams and technologies that enhance our product and platform capabilities and accelerate our ability to deliver world-class consumer light experiences. In closing, I\u2019m pleased with our continued progress and momentum and proud of the extraordinary focus of our company to listen to our customers and deliver the products they need to transform the way work happens. We\u2019re committed to our customers success and are focused on finishing the year strong. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, John. During today\u2019s call, we will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q4 and full year 2017. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues and revenue growth. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and from prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. Subscription revenues for the third quarter were $455 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 43%, and adjusted growth of 41% for an impact of $6 million. PS and other revenues were $43 million representing year-over-year growth of 10%, and adjusted growth of 8% or an impact of $1 million. Subscription billings were $500 million, representing year-over-year growth of 38%, and adjusted growth of 37%, or an impact of $2 million. P/S and other billings were $46 million representing year-over-year growth of 12% and adjusted growth of 10%, or an impact of $1 million. As mentioned in recent quarters our professional services organization is sharpening its focus on partner training, enablement and advisory services while partner ecosystem drives most of our customer implementations. Q3 was the first quarter P/S and other revenues represented less than 10% of total revenue and we expect subscription revenues to increase as a percent of our total revenues in future periods. Subscription gross margin was 85%, professional services and other gross margin was 10% and overall gross margin was 78%. Operating margin was 20% and free cash flow margin was 19%. Let\u2019s turn to guidance. Fourth quarter guidance is the difference between full year 2017 guidance and our actual performance through Q3. So, I\u2019ll just mention updated 2017 guidance in our prepared remarks. The results in Q4 guidance can be found in our earnings release in our IR deck both of which are available at investors.servicenow.com. We are increasing subscription revenues to between $1.728 billion and $1.733 billion, representing 41% to 42% year-over-year growth and 41% adjusted growth or a $6 million impact. We are revising Professional Services and Other revenues to $190 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth and 12% adjusted growth, or a $1 million impact. We are increasing subscription billings to $2.080 billion and $2.085 billion, representing 38% year-over-year growth and 37% to 38% adjusted growth or a $3 million impact. We are revising professional services and other billings to $194 million representing 8% year-over-year growth and 7% adjusted growth for a $1 million impact as more of this work is shifting to our partners. So due in part to that positive impact our training and enablement is having across our partner ecosystem, we removed $1 million and $9 million from Professional Services and Other Q4 revenue in billings respectively. We are increasing our gross margin guidance across the Board and expect subscription gross margin of 85% Professional Services and Other gross margin is 16% and total gross margin of 78%. We expect operating margins and free cash flow margin to remain at 16% and 25%, respectively, due to an increase in 2017 net employee additions to 1,400 and additional Q4 marketing initiatives. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $179 million for the year. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much, and congrats on the quarter. Mike, I guess just a follow-up on that last point, when you look at the guidance and the results this quarter, clearly subscriptions outpacing your expectations and even when you account for the third quarter beat, it looks like you\u2019re taking out what the implied fourth quarter guide was. I guess how should we think about this going forward in terms of the split between Subscription and Professional Services as we think about fiscal '18 because if you just combine it together, it looks like you\u2019re not really raising but clearly, on a subscription basis you\u2019re taking out your expectations pretty meaningfully. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. So, this is all part of our plan, first of all, as we\u2019re shifting more of that business to our partners. And by the way that\u2019s low margin business as well, too. We\u2019re really focused more on the subscription which is the recurring. I\u2019m not giving guidance for 2018 right now. But I will say I do expect P/S and Other, as a percent of total, to be kind of 8% or less of our total revenue with subscription, obviously, being the bulk of that. Kirk Materne : Okay. Great. Then just one follow up for John. John, obviously a much bigger presence from ServiceNow at the HR tech show this year. Can you just talk about sort of the brand recognition in that part of the market and how you see the HR side of your opportunity unfolding as we look ahead maybe in the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks. John Donahoe : Well, sure, Kirk. I think what\u2019s behind really what\u2019s very strong demand for our HR product is a real focus on really across almost every company around the employee experience, really driving an improved employee experience. I think that\u2019s on every CEO\u2019s agenda and increasingly on every CHRO\u2019s agenda. And the thing to keep in mind is that employee experience is not just an HR issue, and employees\u2019 experience cuts across IT, HR, facilities, finance, all parts, and that\u2019s what our products really do. They drive a cross-functional, improved employee experience. In fact, we\u2019re thinking about even relabeling it not so much as HR but employee experience. And so that demand is quite strong. It\u2019s coming both from IT and HR, frankly driven by, as I said earlier, overall company-wide initiatives to improve employee experience. And so, the business is quite strong, and I think there\u2019s a growing awareness to really deliver those experiences. You need a cross-functional platform, and that\u2019s the role we\u2019re playing. So, demand\u2019s strong. Three of our top 10 new customers were led by the employee experience product. We\u2019ve now got almost 119, 120 G2Ks for using our employee experience product and we think there\u2019s ample opportunity. I\u2019ll also just say one more thing, which is we do not compete with what Workday or Success Factors do. They are outstanding HR systems. And, for instance, we use Workday internally, and our goal is to partner very effectively with Workday, Success Factors and other HCM products to help deliver enterprise-wide great employee experiences. Kirk Materne : Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Actually, it\u2019s -- thanks for taking my question. Actually, I wanted to stay on that topic. How do you see that market evolving? Because at Workday a couple of weeks ago, they actually started to seem to think that they need an employee portal, they wanted to have something around onboarding, which is kind of something where you kind of have a big advantage given your platform. Can you see how kind of you see position in the HR markets playing out going forward? Thank you. John Donahoe : Sure, [Keith]. Again, I just look at it through the eyes of the customers. I\u2019ve probably now spent time with close to 500 customers in my first six months. And the way they talk about it is employee experience, and they\u2019re recognizing, as I just said a minute ago, employees don\u2019t think in terms of what function they\u2019re acting with. They don\u2019t want to think, oh, I have an IT problem, or an HR problem, or facilities problem, or a legal problem. They just want to have a good experience. And so, our enterprise portal allows to have one single portal, though you get any of your problems resolved. And it connects into all the systems of record of the various functions. And so, through the eyes of the customer, the customers want our platforms to work effectively together, to deliver that great customer and customer experience and that great employee experience. And so, you saw during the quarter, we announced an agreement with Success Factors. We\u2019re trying to more deeply integrate our products and the data across the products to help deliver seamless experiences for our customers and their employees, and that\u2019ll continue to be our focus. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Makes sense. It\u2019s funny, actually, we are using it and it looks like it\u2019s working really well. Thank you. John Donahoe : Right. Right. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss, if your line is on mute, please unmute your line. Sanjay Singh : Hi. This is Sanjay Singh for Keith Weiss. I have two questions. One, just a question on AI and virtual agents. John, how do you see that on sort of impacting the market, particularly your ITSM service offering, and just the impact of virtual agents in general as you sort of play this market forward over the next couple of years? What would you see -- what would be the impact in terms of the delivery model? And then, what would be the impact on your modernization strategy over time? John Donahoe : Well, Sanjay, we\u2019re thrilled about the potential of this machine learning. As you know, we bought DxContinuum early this year. Indeed, as we do all acquisitions, they rebuilt their code, recoded their capability into our core platform, and it\u2019s going to enable all of our applications and all of our customers to access that machine learning for specific use cases. It\u2019s not AI for AI\u2019s sake or machine learning for machine learning\u2019s sake. It\u2019s to deliver specific use cases. And let me give you an example. We were our first beta customer ourselves, and so this summer, we turned on the machine learning to our own customer support center, right? We\u2019ve got a customer support organization that takes all inbound problems or calls or contacts from our customers. We turned it on with no additional implementation on whatsoever, turning on the capability. Within two weeks, the intelligent agent was outperforming human accuracy on incident categorization and incident routing. And what that means is two things; one, that our customers are getting their problems delivered to the right person as -- in a more quick and accurate basis; and secondly and I\u2019d say as importantly, roughly we estimated 8% of our customer support engineer time used to be incident routing, incident categorization. That\u2019s now freed up to actually solve real problems for our customers. And so that capability we turned on in our customer service management application in the Kingston release, it will be turned on in ITSM at the same time. And we think there is just an enormous number of use cases where the machine learning capability can take some of the more redundant, repetitive parts of work that people are working on, handle them in a more automated fashion, which drives greater efficiency or productivity, and also enables the IT professionals, the HR professionals, the security analysts, the customer support agents to focus their energies on higher value-added activities and really delivering great experiences for customers and employees. So, we think there\u2019s going to be a real positive opportunity. Our customers are very interested in it. And, again, our focus will be taking it use case by use case. Sanjay Singh : Great. And if I had one follow up, if I could, just sort of on the traction outside of ITSM. Obviously, the percentage of new ACV has come up pretty significantly over the last couple of years. I guess what\u2019s interesting is that if we tracked some of the earlier progress, we saw modules like ITOM contributing pretty significantly, security operations management coming online. And now it seems the flavor over the last six, nine months has been on employee/HR. So, I wanted to get a sense of what\u2019s causing some of these dynamics in terms of some of these modules percolating up in terms of net new ACV contribution. Is there a discovery process going with customers or is this more of a go-to-market sales motion that you guys are focusing on? Michael Scarpelli : This is more of our go-to-market. If you recall, in 2015, we realigned our business to have various GMs to focus on the HR, the customer service, and security. We\u2019ve always sold ITOM with ITSM. And I would say that the HR, customer service, and security continue all to do equally well. We\u2019ve mentioned before, the one thing with security ops in the past, their large volume of deals but not big deals. What was very positive this quarter is we did our first $1 million plus net new ACV deal with that. We\u2019ve always done that with HR and customer service and we expect that in Q4. And going forward, we\u2019ll continue to do these larger deals as we\u2019re seeing these opportunities. But it\u2019s really the go-to-market, how we have a dedicated sales support with the different product lines that\u2019s driving us. Sanjay Singh : Super helpful. Thanks, Mike, and congrats on the nice quarter. John Donahoe : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Bachman : Hi, guys. Mike, I was going to direct these towards you if I can. In Q3, the mix was a little bit different if we look at the ACV slide where ITOM as a percent of total and then the other category, if you will, actually declined a little bit sequentially. Now they\u2019re up, to be fair, year over year quite nicely. And then I was just wondering why was the mix a little bit more weighted, frankly, back to the legacy products? And the corollary question is on the duration contracted a little bit or the average contract terms across the board on new customers upsells and renewals. All came down pretty meaningfully but mostly on the new customers. Is there any color you could give us on those two items? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : Sure. I\u2019ll deal with the term, first of all. As you know, Q3 is a big federal government quarter. Both in new business, federal government, as well as renewals for our federal government customers. Most federal government agencies only sign a 12-month contract. That\u2019s across the Board with anyone and that\u2019s what skews it down. If you take out our federal business, we\u2019re normalized back to our normal duration for new business and renewals. You see it more in new business because this was a record federal visitor quarter for us. Keith Bachman : Okay. Michael Scarpelli : That business more than doubled year-over-year for us. In terms of your other question, which was around I apologize. Remind me of your other question that you had. Keith Bachman : Yes. No worries. It was on net new ACV mix. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. What I will say is this past quarter was a great quarter, overall, for net new ACV for us and we saw some very large federal government customers with ICSM. Keith Bachman : Right. Michael Scarpelli : That got us back to that 50% of our business coming from ITSM. And I wouldn\u2019t call it legacy because it still is modern technology. Keith Bachman : Yes. Michael Scarpelli : As I want to stress again, that\u2019s what gets us in the door with our Global 2000. Then we follow with upsells in other businesses. I would say we\u2019ve said in the past ITOM tends to be bigger deals. They tend to be lumpy. Last quarter was a little bit light but it was made up for in other areas and we see that kind of \u2013 you will see that variability but we were very pleased across the board with the strength in all of our products. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thanks, Mike. John Donahoe : And I\u2019d just build on that, Mike. I couldn\u2019t agree with you more with the legacy product comment in that there\u2019s a lot of runway left for ITSM. Both within our existing customers and then as Mike said, in large federal agencies and other large customers. So, it\u2019s a product that has a lot of runway left and I think we\u2019re focused on really going after that. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Two questions. First, Mike, just to make sure we understand on the expense side, I think you talked about some items that come back into expenses in Q4. You had a very strong margin performance this quarter. I\u2019m just wondering what didn\u2019t come into the quarter that drove that upside and then, consequently, the reversal on the quarter. Then I just had another question. Michael Scarpelli : So, part of the improvement in the quarter in operating margin partly was because of our shift in Professional Services going more to our partner. So that took out about $2.9 million in costs actually in the quarter. But on top of that, it was hiring linearity. It was very skewed towards the back half. There was some FX benefit that we had flowing through there. And there was some \u2013 we started some of these initiatives as we talked at last quarter around kind of some of the marketing initiatives and customer success that got delayed until Q4. We\u2019ve as we mentioned in this script, we\u2019re increasing our hiring guidance for Q4 because we see the opportunity in front of us here. And as a result, we\u2019re sticking with the 16% operating margin guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for the full year. We\u2019re reiterating that. It\u2019s on a higher revenue base now, as well, too. Walter Pritchard : And then, Mike, just on sales hiring, I guess. As we look into next year, can you compare sort of your capacity build into 2018 and then any sort of different allocations around the folks that you\u2019re bringing in on the sale side? Michael Scarpelli : So, we have seen increased productivity this year and we\u2019re very pleased with that increased productivity. We were forecasting that as paid off. We are going to continue to invest heavily in our product sales specialists. As well as reps in SC ratio around the world. They\u2019ll anticipate any major changes to our sales organization and how we go to market. It\u2019s going be \u2013 we\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve been doing in 2017 has been working and we\u2019ll continue with that. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. It was great to hear about the million-dollar security deal. I think we\u2019ve been waiting on that. I assume that was for an existing customer but maybe a little bit of color on that. And then maybe can you talk about the sale cycle for that particular component of video? Michael Scarpelli : So that was to an existing customer. Actually, one of our largest customers that we have. Actually, our largest customer. The sales cycle I can\u2019t, John... John Donahoe : I think the sales cycles take a little bit longer. As they CCOs and CIOs are \u2013 you know they have a growing portfolio of security related products, and one of the things our product does is works on a very complimentary way with the other security products. Just like I said in HR how her employee experience, we work in a very complimentary way with the world class call it applications in HR, and we are trying work in a very complimentary way with just as we work with work day and play experience, we\u2019ll work with a strong Palo Alto networks for fire eye in the security world. So that makes the sales cycle a little bit longer, but I think there\u2019s strong demand for the incident response capability that we can bring to that portfolio that leads to a good solution for CSOs. Matt Hedberg : Great. And then maybe on a geo perspective. I think EMEA was the largest we\u2019ve seen this percentage of revenue for a while. Was there anything unique about that from a large deal perspective? Was it particular strength in Europe? Or was it something in America? Just sort of curious on the mix there. Matt Hedberg : More than half of our G2K ads this past quarter were international. EMEA was very strong. We now have touched 50% of the G2K and EMEA. And it was just strength across the board internationally, and as John mentioned earlier, all of our regions are ahead of plan for the full year right now. John Donahoe : Yes. Matt, in Q3 I was in Asia, Australia, Japan, and I was in Europe a couple of different times, and met with several leading companies and CIOs in all of those markets. I can tell you what\u2019s striking is, what they\u2019re look for is highly aligned globally. This whole concept that maybe an overly used word, but it\u2019s a word they\u2019re using digital transformation. And what\u2019s clear is, several leading -- some of the largest and most respected multinationals in Europe are considering ServiceNow one of their core partners, and the same thing in Japan and Australia. So, the demand when you listen to it through the words of the customers is very similar and very strong. Matt Hedberg : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with McQuarrie. Your line is now open. Sarah Hindlian : Thank you. Apologies if I am breaking up. I\u2019m having a hard time with the new IOS update. Just a couple of quick questions for you guys. You all know a lot of automation and machine learning, and today you acquired mobile capabilities. How do you think about these? Do these functionalities really drive improved ASPs? Or is it more about customer capture? Or is it simply just feature sets? Then I have a quick follow-up question for Mike. Really in regards to ITOM, which has had let\u2019s call it lumpiness or actually maybe seasonality is a better word. Are we expecting to see similar seasonal trends in Q4? Thanks. John Donahoe : Well, Sarah, on the first part of your question, I\u2019d just say our customers are looking to us to incorporate leading technology, leading innovative technology into our platform so they can access it and leverage it. And they don\u2019t have to integrate it. They can use it out of our platform in a seamless way. And so, the acquisitions of DxContinuum, Qlue, Telepathy and SkyGiraffe are ways we can accelerate our progress in delivering that capability. We have good engineers and capability organically that this, by adding additional teams, and in some cases incremental technology, it simply accelerates our ability to deliver value for our customers. In some cases, we may monetize that. In other cases, it would be part of our core standard offering, but the focus is not monetization, the focus is on delivering really strong value in our platform. That\u2019s ultimately what will get wider adoption of our platform and make it even stickier. Michael Scarpelli : Then your question on seasonality Sara. So obviously Q4 is a strong quarter for us. It\u2019s seasonally the strongest quarter for us. We don\u2019t guide products by quarter. But what I will say is given that Q4 is such a strong quarter for us, ITOM is a relatively high percent, and you will see an increase in absolute net new ACV from ITOM. But I will stress, and we\u2019ve been saying this for years, history has shown that ITOM deals tend to be bigger and they tend to be lumpier. Sarah Hindlian : Right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Moffat Nathanson. Your line is now open. Adam Holt : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I think you all are doing better now than you were the last time I was on a call a few years ago. The first question I have, Mike, I guess is for you. The explanation on durations for Q3 makes a lot of sense around federal and would be to obviously expected. I was a little surprised by the duration impact on Q4 in the guide. It looks like it\u2019s going to be a bigger headwind than I would have expected. Can you maybe walk us through why that would be and just remind us of the mechanics on that? And then I had a quick follow-up on expenses. John Donahoe : The duration impact for Q4 is really \u2013 it\u2019s only one, it\u2019s very small actually. So, I\u2019m not quite sure where you\u2019re seeing that on the subscription side, Adam. Adam Holt : I was just looking at the appendix. For the duration, for the Q4 guidance. John Donahoe : I\u2019m looking at Page 9 in our thing. I\u2019m happy to walk you through that after but I don\u2019t see it. Adam Holt : Okay. We\u2019ll hit that afterward then. And then, secondly on the expenses, to the extent that the shift on the revenue side around post services is maybe happening faster certainly than we modeled. Would we expect to see the incremental benefit from expenses flow through in next year or would we expect to see that reinvested? John Donahoe : You will see the gross margin as our business shifts more to a subscription mix versus professional services. The overall gross margin will increase but part of that Q4, keeping the full year at 16%, remember we just did the Telepathy acquisition at the end of last quarter. We just announced today the SkyGiraffe acquisition, that\u2019s adding 50 more people that wasn\u2019t in our plan at the beginning of our year. Plus, we did two other acquisitions with Clue and DSI earlier in the year. That\u2019s why we\u2019re keeping them at 16%. We have laid out a framework for 2018 and our overall framework in terms of our long-term target and we\u2019ll give guidance in January for next year. Adam Holt : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. Two questions. One just on billings. There is a bit of a de-sell in the billings between this quarter and next. How much of that is just a function of the as in revenues, the shift away from professional services? And then my second question is just an update on the commercial market. Any change in competition there and are you hitting the targets you\u2019re looking for? John Donahoe : So, the first thing on the billings. Q4 of 2016 was such a big beat. And so, you\u2019re on a much higher comp, or tougher comp, you\u2019re looking at. We\u2019re still at the numbers we\u2019re at. There\u2019s not too many companies that are giving that type of subscription billings guidance growth rate as what we just gave for Q4. In terms of the -- and professional services overall does impact the billings but I can\u2019t stress enough, we focus more on subscription. That\u2019s the recurring piece of our business. The professional services is very low margin business. The piece that kind of helps us on professional services is training. But it\u2019s such a small piece of the overall. In terms of the commercial business, commercial continues to do well for us. It was maybe a little bit light last quarter, but I think that\u2019s just timing of things based upon the pipeline we\u2019re seeing for Q4. Commercial looks strong along with all of our businesses. What I will say is we\u2019re off to a very strong start in Q4 and we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in our business. Michael Turits : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair. Your line is now open. Justin Furby : Thanks, guys. Maybe two quick questions. I guess first, for John, I was hoping to get an update on the Inspire team in terms of what the pipeline growth looks like there and maybe give us a sense for the percentage of bigger million dollar plus deals that it\u2019s influencing. And then second for Mike, this quarter for Q3 the 37% subscription billings. It\u2019s obviously a very healthy result but I think it was in line with your guidance on a FX neutral basis. So, I\u2019m just sort of trying to align that with commentary that sounds like you guys had a really strong new ACV quarter that was ahead of expectations. I\u2019m wondering if there was something around bill terms or renewals or things that impacted Q3 sub billings. Thanks. John Donahoe : Sure, Justin. On your first question on Inspire. What I will tell you is there is absolutely excess demand for our Inspire team resources. And as I think everyone knows, what our Inspire team does is go in and work with our customer in a presales or an upsell environment to build out a blueprint if you will. An implementation of strategy, an implementation blueprint, of how they pursue digital transformation. And as I said earlier in my remarks, there\u2019s massive \u2013 virtually every customer is doing digital transformation, and so the demand for our Inspire team to help lay out a very specific plan that taps the best practices of our full customer base is high. And when I go into many of our most successful wins and our largest wins, almost invariably Inspire was part of that sales process. What we\u2019re adding to that now is more systematic post-sale coverage to help with implementation. We talked about our PS strategy. One of the refinements we\u2019re making in our PS strategy is to have our PS teams do more advisory work, where they\u2019re advising the customer and advising our partners and how to actually achieve that blueprint, which was often developed by the Inspire team. So, we\u2019ll continue to make investment in Inspire and in that post-sale coverage in 2018. Michael Scarpelli : So, Justin, in terms of your question on subscription, so our billings, we did do $500 million as we talked about. There was a currency benefit in that number. And even when you strip it out, we still beat by $3 million. I can\u2019t stress enough that that $500 million, or when you look at our subscription billings, less than 30% of that is really coming from net new ACV. The bulk of that comes from our contracted backlog and renewals, as we laid out on page 19 in our Investor deck, and we talked a lot about at our Investor Day. So, we did have a strong net new ACV, but remember we do have a strong gross down that goes into Q4 that gets reflected in Q4. And you may say, well, why then aren\u2019t you reflecting that in your full-year Q4? Because Q4, many of our contracts start in January 1 that get booked in Q4, and that\u2019s why we are one of the SaaS companies that you generally do not see a big decrease in billings in Q1. Justin Furby : Okay. Got it. And so, when you think to Q1 of next year then as well where you won\u2019t see a massive sequential billings? Michael Scarpelli : Correct. Justin Furby : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe two quick ones. Maybe one for John. You gave an interesting statistic on your last earnings call. Your top two customers represented over $15 million in ACV. As you get further down this path and becoming kind of strategic digital transformation partner for your customers, where do these numbers ultimately go in your mind, and what happens? Have you sold all your products wall-to-wall for these customers? Are you fully penetrated? How much upside is there within those customers? And I have a quick follow-up. John Donahoe : Sure, Alex. So, the short answer to your question is no. We absolutely are not fully penetrated in these customers. And I see significant opportunity in expanding our relationships, particularly our G2k relationships and our federal relationships. In most cases, they\u2019re only using -- they may be using ITSM in one division in one geography, and we have potential to expand our ITSM usage across the entire enterprise. A large number of our new customers are buying ITSM for the whole enterprise, but some of our existing ones don\u2019t yet have ITSM for the full enterprise. So, I see upside in ITSM. Even our largest customers are only using three of our products; HR, ITOM and ITSM. So, I think we have upside to grow more and more of these large relationships. It\u2019s a natural evolution. Many of them are saying we\u2019re an important strategic partner. Our platforms -- one of the -- they\u2019re picking three, or four, or five core cloud platforms they want to work with. We\u2019re one of those, and we see growing usage, both of our \u2013 the prepackaged applications we talk about in these earnings calls, but also of our platform. We don\u2019t break out the platform growth, but the platform is also growing very attractively as they\u2019re building \u2013 using our capability to build other workflows that we don\u2019t have out-of-the-box functionality for. And so, this whole theme of digitizing the enterprise, automating workflows wherever possible is creating strong demand, and I think you\u2019ll see that in larger and larger customer relationships over time. Alex Zukin : Got it. And maybe just one follow up. As you shift more work to partners, can you talk about how you expect them to increase the percentage of deals service by partners or driven by partners and kind of what \u2013 how that should play through for next year? John Donahoe : Well, we\u2019re all excited in general. And maybe, Mike, you can put it in specifics. But I will say, we\u2019ve been sitting down with several of our largest partners and doing what I would characterize as joint account plans. It\u2019s really the first time we\u2019ve done this, where we sit down and we\u2019re becoming an increasingly large, relevant, and, in many cases, the highest growth part of their service offering. The ServiceNow practice at leading places like in Accenture and the DXC is a very high-growth part of their portfolio. And so, we\u2019re sitting down and saying, how can we work most closely both in implementation delivery as well as in new prospects and opportunities to go to market together in a more seamless and effective way for customers? And so those plans, I think, will lead to even greater role of the partner ecosystem in our overall business. And I think that\u2019s a win-win for us and for our customers and for the partners. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. I see our partners really more helping accelerate deals as well. I don\u2019t think our partners are going to be selling a lot independently. Our sales force will be in there with the partners, and those partners will help within their customer relationships get deals done quicker for us. The other thing that -- that work is shifting to partners. So, partners have been doing a lot of our work for quite some time. There was also a big piece of our business where we would be the contract with the customer where we would outsource a big chunk of that work to partners. That outsourcing, where the partners are doing the majority of it, we\u2019re not doing that anymore. We are only going be involved in deals where we\u2019re doing most of the work. We may sub some out to partners. But in cases where the partner\u2019s doing the bulk of the work, we want to focus on that advisory work, where we may be a sub to the partner or we may engage directly with the customer as well as the partner engaging directly. Alex Zukin : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Owens with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Rob Owens : Great, and thanks for taking my question. You guys have touched on it several times throughout the call but I\u2019d love for you to elaborate somewhat on the success you saw in the federal vertical, types of agencies you\u2019re seeing that with. And it seemed like from some of your commentary, that might have been ITSM-related. We\u2019d just like more color there. Thanks. Michael Scarpelli : You can go, John, first, and. John Donahoe : Sure. Well, as you know, we\u2019ve been focusing on ITSM for several years and now \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry, on federal, and now have a dedicated federal sales force, which I think is really, really helpful in this. And so, what\u2019s happening is across the U.S. government and, frankly, I talked to governmental leaders in Australia, the U.K., Netherlands, where governments are starting to have to go through the same digitization process that companies go through. And so, governments are now embracing cloud. And one of the first people they\u2019re turning to as they begin that journey of how they embrace cloud is ServiceNow. And so, the largest federal deal we did in history, the $7 million ACV deal, was largely ITSM, fundamentally an ITSM deal. And these are big opportunities for us. One of the undersecretaries of this department said that it was their first enterprise-wide SaaS solution. It\u2019s going to support 500,000 end users and almost five million contacts per year. And so, these are large organizations that are under pressure to streamline and automate how they operate, both to lower cost and to serve their employees and citizens better. And our platform is a natural starting point. I\u2019ll also say I\u2019ve had some interesting conversation with some of the security agencies looking at our security offering as a way to augment how they provide security at the federal and state levels. Michael Scarpelli : I would just add, Rob, that eight of our $22 million net new ACV deals in the quarter were federal. Eighteen percent of our net new ACV in the quarter was federal, up from 10% in the year-ago quarter. So federal was very strong for us. And a lot of that was based upon the investments we\u2019ve made in our federal sales organization over the last couple of years. Rob Owens : Great. And then secondarily, Mike, if you look at the variables you\u2019ve thrown out to kind of achieve your $4 billion spreadsheet exercise, you\u2019ve been tracking well ahead on the Global 2000 customer additions. But if we look at sequentially the trends in ACV within the G2K, this year quite hasn\u2019t paced with where it was last year or even gotten to that 4% bogey yet. Is that a function of large numbers or is there something else that might be weighing that down throughout the first three quarters of this year? John Donahoe : No. A lot of that is we\u2019ve landed a lot of new Global 2000, especially you saw half of those were international this quarter and a lot of Global 2000 customers start out small. I am expecting, or I should say, we are expecting based upon what we see in our pipeline, Q4 will be a very strong upsell quarter to the federal government. We have a number of large deals in the pipeline that are upsells. And so, I feel pretty good about that number. But I just want to remind people, in 2015 when we set out that 20 Global 2000 per quarter 4% growth to get to that 1,000, that was just a framework. You can see our numbers have been track. We feel good about getting, whether it\u2019s 3.8% average growth or 4.1%, we feel pretty good about that. We\u2019re well ahead on the 1,000 G2K. We only need to add 14 a quarter now to get there. Rob Owens : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question comes from Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Security. Your line is now open. Parthiv Varadarajan : Hey, guys. This is Parthiv on for Abhey. Just following up on a prior question around international. Can you give us a sense of maybe differences in buying trends in those geos? I guess which use cases are most apparent to new customers? And which ones do they need to be coached on to drive further adoption? John Donahoe : Abhey, I\u2019ll maybe start on that just by reiterating what I said earlier which is I\u2019m really struck by the similarities rather than the differences. And probably the biggest difference is cloud adoption. Certain countries are more ahead on cloud adoption. The U.S., the U.K., Australia, really Northern Europe. Interestingly, Japan is really coming on where cloud adoption is getting stronger and that\u2019s partly driving our strong Japanese growth. And Germany is probably a half step behind on cloud adoption and dealing with more some of the German security and data localization issues. And so, I think that offer is real growth opportunity in the coming years as Germany begins and many of the large multinationals in Germany beginning to embrace cloud more fundamentally. So, we\u2019re positioning ourselves to able to take advantage from it. And then last thing I\u2019ll just reiterate, as I said a few minutes ago, the governments, state, regional, local and federal governments in literally Australia, the U.K., other parts of Europe, the U.S., are adopting cloud more aggressively and that\u2019s generating underlying demand for our platform and from a few of the other cloud platforms. Parthiv Varadarajan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks for fitting me in, guys. So, we\u2019re hearing great things about your security ops product. I wanted to ask you about the long-term strategy. If you take -- if you talk to a lot of the traditional security vendors, they\u2019re getting increasingly vocal about the need for consolidation just to make the problem go away and reduce the number of disparate point products that they\u2019re having to deal with. How do you see yourself competing in a consolidating environment? John Donahoe : Well, I\u2019d say, Brad, that it\u2019s, again, I\u2019ll go back to how I answered a previous question, which is kind of through the eyes of the customer. Right? And CTOs increasingly have three categories of issues to deal with. They\u2019ve got to prevent problems, they have to detect problems and then they have to respond when there are events. And they\u2019re getting a growing number of event signals. And they have to sort through, really, an exploding number of event signals, if you will, potential event signals coming from -- and so it\u2019s in the latter category that our product is so valuable to help them sort through those. I think the burden is on us to work with the other cloud platforms as seamlessly as possible and as effectively as possible. And frankly, in the last -- literally last couple weeks I\u2019ve met with the CEOs of a couple of the leading security cloud platforms about how we can integrate our products most effectively. And we\u2019re good at what we do. We are good at the work flow. The incident response, the predict and prevent. Others are good at collecting data, parsing through the data. Others are good at creating firewalls and other things. If it was all one company you wouldn\u2019t have best-in-class capabilities. And the power of cloud should be that each of us do what we are best-in-class at and then use the flexibility of cloud to more seamlessly pull together solutions for the customers. That\u2019s what they want and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on delivering. Brad Zelnick : John, it\u2019s clear you\u2019re coming at it from a real unique angle, and that\u2019s resonating really well in the market. If I could turn just to the platform as a service opportunity. I noticed an award that you\u2019d won for PaaS recently. Just wanted to understand how much is standalone opportunity in the future that could be monetized independently versus a way to customize and add onto core apps? John Donahoe : It\u2019s a great question, Brad. It\u2019s frankly one where we are talking a lot about right now because there is growing demand for our platform. And the two things I hear from customers, and Mike hears it, we all hear it when we\u2019re with them. They want out of the box functionality for our applications, and they want the flexibility of our platform. Because they want to expand it and use it in other work flows, and other situations. And so, we\u2019re trying to invest, CJ Desai, who is our Chief Product Officer, his Number 1 investment priority is our platform. And strengthening and investing in our platform building mobile capabilities, machine learning, chat functionality, mobile capability. And so that our platform, both for applications and for the more customer driven use cases, is strong and robust. We\u2019re monetizing it currently. We\u2019ll continue to monetize it. We\u2019re going to look at definite ways. That could be one of the first areas we look at things like transaction pricing. So, the demand is strong and we\u2019re going to first and foremost invest in making the platform strong. Then continue to try to make sure it gets us widespread adoption as possible. Because that frankly creates the kind of sticky and value-added customer relationships that will be the foundation of our ability to go from 4 billion to 10. Michael Scarpelli : I\u2019ll just add 15 of our top 20 deals included platform this past quarter. Brad Zelnick : Awesome. All right. Thanks again, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jesse Hulsing : Yes. Thank you. John, a couple of questions for you. The first \u2013 partner has been a big part of the ServiceNow story. And all of them have had a lot of success with ITSM. And some of them are starting to have success with some of your newer product lines. I\u2019m just wondering how do you -- how you think partners are versus where you\u2019d like them to be on some of your newer products? Are there things that you can do to get them more involved in HR and in Customer Service? In Tech Ops and that sort of thing? Then I have a follow-up as well. John Donahoe : As you said Jesse, partners are critically important. And in the meetings, I referred to earlier, one of the areas for instance that, in addition to ITSM and ITOM, our partners are getting very involved in the employee experience efforts that we described earlier. I was at one of the leading banks in the U.K., two weeks ago, meeting with their COO and their Chief I\u2019ll call it transformation officer around employee experience. And they were talking about how we -- they, along with us, in this case, Workday was their HCM provider and a third-party partner can work together to deliver the kind of great employee experience. So, partners around employee experiences are working with our customers and with us to help deliver that seamless experience that taps our capability as well as that of the other cloud platforms. And so, one of the things we\u2019re working with, the partners on is how can they build the expertise in each of our product lines, in each of the geographies so that we can jointly ensure that the customers get \u2013 are able to get our products implemented with the maximum speed and maximum effectiveness. So, we\u2019re trying to work more closely together at that. And it also ties to what Mike mentioned earlier with the training and certification. We\u2019re ramping up our training and certification capabilities to help them train and certify a growing number of people in our non-ITSM products. Jesse Hulsing : Got you. That makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s good to hear. And then last question for me. How is \u2013 how is your thinking evolving regarding M&A? The ServiceNow strategy of acquiring tuck-ins and replatforming them and integrating them tightly with your core platform has worked really well. Would you consider something more transformative down the road? John Donahoe : I guess the old adage, \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d comes to mind. So, I think the approach we\u2019re using currently makes a lot of sense. And we have organic growth opportunities that are so strong that that\u2019s going to be priorities one, two and three, is executing on our organic growth. Now that requires us, wherever possible, to do tuck-in acquisitions of talents and capabilities to accelerate our ability to deliver on that organic growth. But the opportunities we have organically are so strong, that that is absolutely executing on that is fundamental priorities one, two and three. Jesse Hulsing : Great. Thanks, John. Operator : And our last question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Karl Keirstead : Thank you for fitting in. For Mike or John, I\u2019d love to ask about pricing trends. Especially as you add new features in Jakarta and soon Kingston. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s fair to say that pricing, either per fulfiller or per user, has an upward bias these days and is likely to have that throughout \u201918 as well? Thank you. John Donahoe : So, I will say, Karl, our kind of philosophy around pricing has not been to increase the price per user per se. It\u2019s to drive more users at our customers on our product so we\u2019re extracting more dollars over time. I will say that as we are selling today, our latest versions to new customers, those products or those applications have a lot more features and functionality than it did two years ago so we are able to extract more on a per user basis and show customers real value. So yes, over time I do expect our pricing with what we\u2019re extracting out of customers to increase but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a big increase per user at our customers slight. Karl Keirstead : Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : And that concludes the Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Scarpelli for any further remarks. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investor section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Sir, you may begin. Michael Scarpelli : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is John Donahoe, our President and Chief Executive Officer. I'd like to apologize if my voice is not clear today, or if I start to cough, as I'm suffering from a cold flu bug.

I would now like to turn the call over to John. John Donahoe : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. We reported a strong Q4 today. Our best quarter ever, giving us terrific momentum as we enter 2018. Our teams did an outstanding job executing on behalf of our customers and I want to thank them for their exceptional focus and commitment. We closed a record 41 deals, with ACV greater than $1 million. And we now have 500 customers doing more than $1 billion in business with us, up 43% year-over-year. And we have 50 customers doing more than $5 million per year, that's more than double it was than 12 months ago. And we ended 2017 with our biggest customer topping $20 million, reflecting the growing opportunity to be a strategic partner enabling customer success. Our performance continued to be strong worldwide, with each region outperforming their plan for Q4 and for the full year. Our renewal rate remained consistently strong at above 97% and we added 23 new G2K customers, ending the year with 840. Our average ACV with G2K customers grew 10% sequentially. Our consistent performance underscores our strong product portfolio. We create simpler, faster, better ways for people to get work done, enabling better business outcomes and delivering better customer and employee experiences. And our geographic footprint and strong partner ecosystem give us the ability to serve a diverse customer base and to drive global transformation for our largest customers. In conversations with customers worldwide, I consistently hear how CIOs are being tasked with leading digital transformations across their companies and are looking to deliver great customer and employee experiences in the process. And CIOs are looking for the right strategic technology partners to help them. ServiceNow has become a core strategic partner for CIOs and other C-suite Executives on their transformation journey. We are uniquely positioned to be the connective tissue that streamlines and simplifies workflows across the enterprise, eliminating silos, and creating more seamless interactions. For example, companies are looking to transform the end-to-end employee experience. Employees have come to expect delightful mobile and digital experience at home and are increasingly looking for the same kind of digital experiences at work. This requires looking at the full end-to-end employee experience as an enterprise-wide initiative, which requires cross-functional collaboration and partnership and integrated digital solutions. Increasingly, we see CIOs partnering with CHROs and other C-suite leaders to deliver this experience. It requires linking together multiple enterprise products and platforms into a seamless experience for their employees. This is what ServiceNow does. In Q4, this enterprise-wide approach was reflected in the continued strength of our platform and product portfolio. 18 of our top 20 deals included at least four products, and our flagship ITSM product was included in all but one of our top 20 deals. And we saw strong results with our HR service delivery, CSM, and Security Operations products. For example, a top 20 global financial institution bought our HR service delivery product to better engage several hundred thousand of employees worldwide. And we saw our largest Security Operations deal to-date with another global enterprise, which views us as a strategic partner to create a common global approach to security incident response management. This customer now uses six of our products. Our customers want us to continue to lead and innovate with best-in-class out-of-the-box integrations and configurations and we're deeply committed to delivering customer success. World-class product experiences and customer success are top priorities for us, and we're investing in both. Focusing on customer success, we recently aligned all of our customer success teams, customer success management, professional services, training and certification and our partner ecosystem team into one group under the leadership of our Chief Revenue Officer, Dave Schneider. This integration will ensure that we optimize value for our customers. We're evolving customer success as a natural extension of our sales motion, continuing to land new customers and expand existing customer relationships in a healthy and sustainable manner. In closing, I'm very pleased with our team's strong finish to 2017 and our continued progress and momentum as we enter 2018. I just attended my first ServiceNow sales kickoff meeting and it was an incredible experience. The passion, energy and excitement of our people to engage new customers and expand how we serve our existing customers is palpable. And that's what makes ServiceNow such a special company; our deep commitment to helping our customers succeed. I look forward to continuing this journey in 2018 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, John. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter financial results according to historical revenue recognition standard 605 and we'll discuss our financial guidance for Q1 and full year 2018 according to the new revenue recognition standard 606. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues and revenue growth. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. Q4 was our first quarter with more than $1 billion of total contract value signed, leading to combined backlog and deferred revenue of $3.9 billion or 39% year-over-year growth, giving us strong momentum heading into 2018 and on our path to $4 billion in 2020. Subscription revenues for the fourth quarter were $497 million, representing year-over-year growth of 44% and an adjusted growth of 41%. And PS and other revenues were $49 million, representing year-over-year growth of 20% and adjusted growth of 16%. Subscription billings were $684 million, representing year-over-year growth of 41% and an adjusted growth of 40%. I want to point out that this includes approximately $20 million of billings that we had expected in Q1 of 2018. Our PS and other billings were $50 million, representing year-over-year growth of negative 1% and adjusted growth of negative 4%. Moving on to margins, our operating margin was 18%, and free cash flow margin was 27%. As disclosed in our press release and our presentation, we adopted 606 effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we restated prior periods for upfront revenue recognition for on-premise deals, deferral and amortization of commission costs, and classification of proceeds related to Knowledge as a reduction in sales and marketing expense. Let's turn to guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018 under the new 606 accounting standard. For the first quarter, we except -- expect subscription revenues between $525 million and $530 million, representing 35% to 37% year-over-year growth and 31% to 32% adjusted growth. We expect subscription billings between $601 million and $605 million, representing 25% to 26% year-over-year growth and 25% to 26% adjusted growth. As I mentioned earlier, this does not include approximately $20 million that we expected in Q1, but billed in Q4. And separately, Q1 guidance doesn't include approximately $4 million due to 606 accounting changes. And lastly for Q1, we expect 16% operating margin and 184 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For full year 2018, we expect subscription revenues between $2.355 billion and $2.375 billion, representing 35% to 37% year-over-year growth and 33% to 34% adjusted growth. We expect subscription billings between $2.77 billion and $2.79 billion, representing 31% to -- 30% to 31% year-over-year growth and 29% to 30% adjusted growth. Moving on to margins, we expect subscription gross margins of 85%, operating margin of 20%, and free cash flow margin of 27%. For the full year, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 185 million. Before closing, please note our financial Analyst Day will be held on Monday, May 7th in Las Vegas in conjunction with our Annual Users' Conference, Knowledge18. In-person attendance will be limited, so if interested, please send an e-mail to ir@servicenow.com. For those who cannot join in person, we will hold a webcast of the event accessible on our IR website. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on a great fiscal year. John, I just want to follow-up on sort of a statement you made about becoming more strategic for CEOs and other C-level decision makers. As you guys continue down that path, and you're obviously having a lot of success based on the large deals you're signing, what additional investments do you guys need to make as we head into 2018 to continue that progress that I know you're hoping to continue going forward? John Donahoe : Thanks Kirk. So, as I said in the script, I think I'm at -- final tally was something like 500 different customers last year. And what is really apparent is as the CIOs are dealing with the need to digitally transform their companies, right, CEOs are looking -- every CEO said, I want to do a digital transformation. And they're increasingly looking to the most technically literate person in the C-suite to lead that, which is, in many cases, the CIO. And the CIOs, if I were to summarize what they're saying to me, they're saying, Look, we're embracing cloud. But as I drive this, I need a few trusted partners, a few trusted platforms that I depend upon. And they're making their choices down at the infrastructure level. They're choosing AWS or Azure, maybe a Google or an IBM. And then they're looking for a few key strategic software platforms. And increasingly, we are one of those core strategic software platforms. And I hear that regularly. And they're looking to us to not only help them -- usually, it's initially an ITSM or an existing application. But increasingly, they're looking at cross-functional workflows. I'll use the example of employee experience being one of them or an onboarding experience. But that's not the only one. They're looking at the -- and customer support. They're looking at that as a cross-functional workflow so that they can identify when they have an inbound contact, how they get to the root cause and fix it so that, that contact doesn't happen the next time. And so as we think about ourselves as a strategic platform, what's interesting is they're pulling us into new applications. They're asking, what are your next out-of-the-box applications going to be? And so I would view our priorities, therefore, to take full advantage of that to be a couple-fold. And this is how we're -- if you were to look at our 2018 investments, they will be as follows. One, we're investing heavily in our product and platform. And so we're investing heavily in deeply embedding machine learning and -- in our platform. I'm delighted that is actually now live in Kingston in CSM and ITSM; investing deeply in our platform around mobile end user experience; and investing in making sure all of our applications are continuously evolving with new products and features like Cloud Management. Second area of investment is customer success. These large companies need help driving transformation and reengineering, redesigning their processes. And so -- and they're asking for us to play a more proactive role, partnering with third-party ecosystem providers and so the significant investment in customer success. And as I said, we put all the elements of customer success under Dave Schneider so that it is understood from day one to be an extension of our sales motion. Third area of investment is talent. We're growing aggressively, adding people all over the world, needing to add new talents, new capabilities, people that have had experienced at the scale we are and at the scale we're going to. And I mentioned last call, we've hired Pat Wadors, our new Chief Talent Officer, who is immediately investing in leadership development, career planning, some of the basic fundamentals of strong talent organization. And last but not least, we're also investing in our company brand. Our product brands are very well known with decision makers. Our product brands are very well known in the world of IT. But our company brand, we're the best kept secret on Silicon Valley or best kept secret across industries, and that's simply because we never really focused on building our company brand. And so I brought Alan Marks with me. Alan was the Chief Communications Officer at eBay for the last decade. I'd hired him from Nike. He's joined us and that starts with our core purpose. And you'll see us begin to do a little bit of experimentation around elevating our company brand, which, frankly, has as much benefit for recruits and employees as it does external parties, but it will help us raise our visibility at the C-suite a little bit. So, those are the four key areas of investment for 2018 and the plan that Mike outlined, and the expectations allow full funding of those priorities. Kirk Materne : And if I could ask -- thanks very much, if I could a really quick follow-up for Mike. Just on the $20 million that sort of slipped into the fourth quarter that you expect in the first quarter, I assume that was all subscription billings. There wasn't any professional service revenue in that number? Michael Scarpelli : Yes, that was 100% subscription. That's what I'm giving. I'm only guiding to -- we are only guiding to subscription billings because that's what we are really focused on as our PS business is transitioning more to our partners. And if you actually take that $20 million plus the $4 million I mentioned due to the 606 accounting change for on-prem, that $24 million added to our midpoint would be a 31% year-over-year growth. Kirk Materne : Super. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg : Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter. John, in your prepared remarks you talked about HR, SecOps and CSM. I think they performed well this quarter. For my question, I wanted drill down into CSM a little bit. It seems like there's a lot of momentum there and I think particularly in B2B customers. And from what we've heard, a lot of that's due to your ability to do deeper root cause analysis. I was curious to get your take on that market opportunity. John Donahoe : Sure Matt. And you're lucky you're not sitting across the table from Mike because he's coughing. Poor Mike. If you can see him, the guy's got a fever and a flu. So, he's a trooper to be here. The CSM market, the customer service -- I think this is an important distinction, by the way, what I'm about to say because it's how we think about ourselves as a company. CSM is a huge market, right? Customer service is a huge market. And the reality is our value proposition is really attractive for a portion of the market, not the whole market. And in particular, our value proposition is attractive in situations where you have a lot of high inbound contacts where the customer doesn't want to spend a lot of time on the phone, but rather wants to identify what the root causes are of those inbound contacts, get them fixed, so that next time those contacts don't come in or if the contacts, they can be automated and how the response is. And if they can't be automated, the customer can use self-help. And so as you mentioned, high-volume B2B is one of the use cases where that happens. And you know what, customer value is -- and I think that's a very strong return on investment, is as that inbound contact comes in, it's not a separate customer support platform or customer service product. It's on the same core ServiceNow Platform, which allows a cross-functional workflow. So, let's say for many, many companies in the digital world, the number one contact of inbound -- the number one root cause of inbound contact is password reset. So, for a company that's got that as an inbound contact and they want to fix their password process, fixing password reset is not -- one function can't do that alone. Legal has got to be involved in that. Compliance has to be involved in that. Security, cyber has to be involved in that. Obviously, product teams have to be involved in that. Technology has to be involved in that. And so what our platform can uniquely do is take that inbound contact, route the problem to the right area, in the right sequence, in the right way so that all those functions can work effectively together to improve the password reset process so that next time someone has a password reset problem, they can get it addressed in an automated fashion, much like happens in the consumer Internet world, right, where you can reset your password, reset in about 20 seconds, wherever you are all over the world. And what the customer then gets is a lower number of inbound contacts, more satisfied customers. And thus, they put a high return on investment in our product that way. And so we're really targeting industries like telecom, tech, B2B, financial services, where they have those attributes. And it's a large market, as you mentioned. The product's got a lot of momentum. It had 4 million plus deals in Q4. We released machine learning. We're calling it Agent Intelligence. Remember last call, I talked about how when we used it on our own, we used our own machine learning on our own inbound contact, it took issue categorization, issue routing and in 14 days, improved it materially. And now customers have that available to them. So, a bit of a long-winded answer, but it's a product and an area that we're really excited about and a big market opportunity. Matt Hedberg : That's super. And then maybe just a quick on the SIs. John, when you're talking to the Accentures and the DXCs of the world, what did they tell you in terms of the size of business that ServiceNow can be within those brands? I mean can you be in the same breath of a Microsoft or an SAP or a Salesforce in terms of these SI -- the SI business development? John Donahoe : Well, that's certainly the goal that both they have and we have. We consistently hear that we're -- if not the -- if not one of or the fastest-growing practice in their portfolios. And that's just -- you just have to look at our growth rate. It's just -- that is sort of obvious. But what I think they're excited about working with us on is we're creating -- our platform, right, is all around redesigning workflows. And it's really hard for these companies to redesign workflows on their own, and so having a valued SI, a valued partner to do that in Accenture, a DXC, a Deloitte -- I was actually with Unisys this morning that's got a huge government business in the security area. And when customers are buying ServiceNow, to get real value out of ServiceNow, they want to reengineer their processes, redesign those workflows. So, you're not just slapping old workflows on a cloud platform. You're redesigning the workflows and wall putting them on ServiceNow's platform, and that delivers maximum value to the customer. It also generates healthy, high value-added business for the third-party partners. And so we're looking to lean in with them and work side-by-side at the customer to help the customers realize real value and help grow both of our businesses in healthy and sustainable manners along the way. Matt Hedberg : Thanks a lot John. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, I have avoided the question for Mike. I hope you feel better soon. John, you talked earlier about the changes to the success group and bringing everything under Dave Schneider. Can you talk a little bit more on the change that you're doing there? If you've seen that historically, like you have like at least short-term issues in terms of responsibility, who's doing what, what's the P&L structure there, et cetera? Just maybe double-click on that one a little bit. Thank you. John Donahoe : Yes. Well, it's a great question and it's one where I would characterize us to be in an important learning year because what we ended up doing is saying, all right, if you started and you work your way backwards, how does the customer really realize success using our platform? It's very much what I was talking about in the previous answer, which is for them to really get real value, they have to reengineer their processes, be it an ITSM process, be it an onboarding end-to-end employee experience process or the CSM process I talked to in the previous answer. And so that means you need us and highly trained, highly certified, third-party partners to do that. And so we've taken, as I mentioned earlier, our training and certification business, broken it out so it reports directly to Dave, investing heavily to ensure that we're expanding the number of highly qualified, certified ServiceNow partners out there in the geographies and in the products we need around the world. Similarly, as I mentioned earlier, we need a really strong partner ecosystem. And so we're leaning in on building strong sets of relationships. So, we have our top five, our gold tier. And we've also raised the bar at the bottom. And so we're actually going to have fewer partners because we're saying if you're not current on your certifications of our full product portfolio, then you will no longer be a recommended and qualified partner. So, that's partner ecosystem. Our own PS organization, as you know, went through some adjustment last year because we said we're not going to try to compete with our third-party partners. But there are circumstances where PS -- our own PS, is the right answer for a customer. And those tend to be early products, right, where there's not a lot of experience in the market and we want to help build implementation playbooks or large, multiproduct buys where they're using us in a sort of cheap architect adviser role, helping the third-party ecosystem partner. And there are some customers who would just rather deal with their own PS organization. So, that's the third piece of this equation. Then Dean Robison is leading our early experimentation of providing sort of more dedicated -- or quasi-dedicated post-sale solutions architects and implementation experts. And then lastly, and this last piece is quite important, is our strong investment in what we're calling our customer success center, which is -- we refer to this as the tech touch portion of customer success. There's a high touch or human touch portion of customer success where you're actually touching the customer, but this is -- and you're already seeing some early examples of this on our website, the Value Calculator, right? This Value Calculator is live on our website. Check it out. That's helping an IT leader begin to have a return on investment discussion among IT and with his/her CFO and CEO. We'll be capturing best practices in one place and making it available to customers, to partners, to our sales team. We'll be making all of the learning we have across the third-party partner ecosystem and our experiences available to our customers on our website and through digital means. And so all of that needs to work in a seamless way. And Dave Schneider, who obviously built the world-class presales team we've got today, along with Kevin Haverty, Dave's now putting the same kind of energy and focus in this post-sales motion. And we're trying to ensure it doesn't feel like two different things to a customer. It feels like one continuous end-to-end trusted partner that they can count on and deal with. And so we're investing in it. We'll do a lot of learning this year. We'll determine where the leverage points are, how we calculate the right kind of return on investment framework. So, we're in a position to really scale it further in 2018, confidently and reliably. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie. Your line is now open. Sarah Hindlian : All right, great. Thank you so much both John and Mike. I was jumping between calls, so I apologize if you've hit on any of this. But John, I know we talked in December about ServiceNow approaching becoming a much larger strategic partner for its customers. And I'm wondering how you are -- how you're feeling about maybe even moving towards the focused account list and how that's going. And then I also wanted to talk to you a little bit about some of the feature sets that are coming out in Kingston because we're hearing some very exciting things there about the release. And then I have a follow-up for Mike. John Donahoe : Great. Mike's going to chew the cough drop to get ready for your question. Sarah Hindlian : That's okay. John Donahoe : Sarah, so yes, as I said earlier, we are being asked to play more of a -- I would call it, strategic partner role. And I would say what is, in essence, a natural evolution of our company given the size and scale we are is to have what you described as a focused account list. We call it select accounts. Where these are -- we are now -- we have almost -- we have, what, 840 of G2K. We have so many large, global, multinational companies for whom we're a strategic partner that we're learning how to cover them more effectively. And that's what, in essence, customer success is. It's the ability to sort of cover them in an end-to-end basis and ensure they get value, and we're highly confident that that's going to increase and accelerate our ability to expand our relationships with them. And we already see some early evidence of that. I mentioned we have one $20 million customer. By the way, that $20 million customer, we now account for, I think, 0.5% of their total IT spend. So, I think if you think about the magnitude of impact our platform can have, reengineering processes, which can drive measurable, demonstrable return on investment, which will increase their likelihood of investing more in the ServiceNow Platform and applications. And so we're trying to evolve our coverage models and some of our disciplines, fundamental discipline, account planning, and then account planning, a new muscle for us. And so Dave and Kevin and our teams are -- we're taking a few of our select accounts this year and we'll be building prototypes. Does that Sarah Hindlian : That's very helpful. John Donahoe : And Kingston, yes, Kingston. Sarah Hindlian : Yes, please. John Donahoe : Kingston is very -- the feedback on Kingston is -- just been fabulous. Interestingly, it's been live for less than a month, and we have 90 customers already implement it, which is already upgraded, so which is a nice indication that the upgradability, once you -- we're improving in the speed and quality of our upgradability so that you can upgrade quickly, customers are able to upgrade quickly. And the reason customers want upgrade is, as you mentioned, some of the feature sets in that, probably most notably is just machine learning. There are a lot of talk in the industry about machine learning. As you know, we bought DxContinuum about a year ago, rebuilt it into our core platform, and now machine learning's available for ITSM and CSM on real problems that real customers have. It's not a solution looking for a problem. It's inbound categorization and routing. It's an ITSM. It's helping to drive greater automation and productivity. And so machine learning in each of our applications is sort of one big feature of Kingston. The second is you've heard both CJ Desai and I talk about we're going to get serious about user experience. And we're going to get serious about user experience using consumer Internet standards, not just enterprise software standards. And to be honest, we have a long way to go. But Kingston was our first step in this direction, and our customers are seeing material improvements in our user experience. And that will continue through London and Madrid this year, where you'll see a significant improvement in the fulfiller experience as well as in the end user, whether that's an employee or an end customer, our customers' customers' experience. And that -- remember last year, we bought Telepathy. We've recently hired some outstanding user experience talent along with Telepathy. So, we're investing in user. We bought SkyGiraffe, which is mobile. We fully intend to have mobile capabilities native into the platform this year. Our mobile capabilities, I think, are good by enterprise standards. I think they can be so much better. And so those are -- Kingston is really the beginning of what I think will be a rolling thunder, a rolling stream of improved user experiences. And then the last thing that is kind of a fun to mention, you know our Founder Fred Luddy had this vision of allowing -- what he used to call regular people being able to automate workflows. You didn't have to be a developer or someone in IT. And so we built what we're calling no-code development, where someone outside of IT can automate a workflow. And that's interesting because I would say probably a third of our use cases are not in our core platform because our customers are taking our platform and they're using it in workflows and in areas that we never even envisioned or imagined. And so increasingly, whether you're in facilities or you're involved in Internet of Things or you're involved in legal, people in those departments are building really fun and new and exciting automated workflows on top of the ServiceNow Platform. And this no-code development capability enables that. Sarah Hindlian : Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you so much John, I appreciate it. Mike, one more really quick one. I'm sorry, you're sick, but I just want to drill into you. The $24 million in subscription billings, even when I back that out, the sequential decline you're guiding for in Q1 still looks a little bit steeper than usual. Is there anything there other than seasonality that we should be thinking about? Michael Scarpelli : So, first of all, there's $20 million from Q4 that should have been in Q1. That $4 million is purely a 606 accounting that does not impact Q4. And we had such a banner quarter in Q4 that pulled forward a lot of business from Q1 into Q4. You see that $20 million I was referring to is really early renewals and prepayments from customers that drove that, which had no real economic impact on our financial results other than billings and free cash flow part of that. So, as we are getting bigger, we're definitely seeing more seasonality in our business. And if you look at the way that our quota is being distributed throughout the year, Q4 is definitely the big quarter for us. Sarah Hindlian : All right, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for clarifying that. Michael Scarpelli : Thanks Sarah. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. Questions for -- sorry, Mike, two questions for you. One, on 2020, it looks like you're sticking with that -- those goals, in the 25 G2K customers a quarter you're on pace. Can you talk about just as it relates to the salesforce and how you're incenting folks. Are you doing anything to try to either further penetrate the installed base or drive logos given, I mean, when you look at where you were versus a couple of years ago, you have a much bigger product line. I'm curious if you're doing anything different there. And then I have one follow-up. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. So, right now, for our core sales reps, $1 of new ACV pays the same commission no matter what product we have today. That may change in the future, but we find that's the right way to do it. We do have our product sales specialist who focus on the different products to help our salespeople that have goals associated with the product and there aren't -- which, by the way, is consistent with what we've been doing for a number of years. And in terms of incenting new logos or G2K, we have always paid bonuses based upon new logos and stuff to our reps. I don't expect that to change. That's a very small piece of their overall compensation and don't expect any material changes there. We'll continue with that. Walter Pritchard : Got it. And then just on 606. Just any comment on margin impact in terms of the 20% you're giving. And then as it relates to disclosure around the revenue backlog number, is the $3.9 billion number that you're showing there, is that a 606-type backlog number that we can start thinking about using? I heard you did say first $1 billion bookings quarter. I'm just wondering how we should start thinking about the bookings that could come from that metric. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. So, the backlog and deferred revenue is under 605. Our auditors are still working through that disclosure, and that will be put out for the first time in our Q for March quarter. And we will be discussing more at financial Analyst Day kind of how we're seeing how we expect that's going to look. And you'll see the disclosure for the first time, the new disclosures around how your deferred revenue and backlog is going to roll off into revenue in the Q1 period. Did I answer all your questions? I think I forgot one-- Walter Pritchard : Yes, that makes sense. No, that's good. Actually, just margin impact on the 20%, yes. Michael Scarpelli : Yes, you did ask that. So, the 606 in 2018, we're estimating that is going to impact us about -- the adoption of 606, around 1.5%, 1.6%. A lot of that depends upon the timing of and the amount of on-prem revenue. We know the deals we have they're going to be renewing. What I don't know are new customers that may, at the last minute, decide to go on-prem and whether they do one-year deals or multiple year deals because that can materially impact that as well because most of that drops to the bottom-line. Walter Pritchard : Got it, okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Stan Zlotsky : Good afternoon guys. This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith Weiss. And a quick two-part question. First one, the 42% of new ACV mix that is now allocated to the other line, that was a very impressive uptake. If you were to stack rank the products that made up the 42%, I know you mentioned HR, SecOps and customer service, how would you stack rank those products within that 42%? And then I have a quick follow-up. Michael Scarpelli : Yes, those three products are in there as well as our platform and our analytics. And all five of those are kind of between 5% to 10%. They make up that -- and we're not going to go down and guide to individual products. John Donahoe : But they're all growing impressively. I mean, it's not as though one of them is carrying the other ones. It's pretty stunning to see the consistency with growth rate, at least to-date, across those five. Michael Scarpelli : And what I will say is all of those exceeded their plan for the year. Stan Zlotsky : Understood. Got it. And then the other thing that really stood out to us was the 10% increase in ACV from the G2K customers that we saw. What drove such a big increase? And should we think about this as the typical seasonality going forward as you sign more of the large customers in Q4? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : As I was talking at investor conferences after last quarter, we had mentioned that we felt pretty confident Q4 we're going to make up for that because we had a lot of contracted upsells as well as we sell our pipeline. Q4 tends to be a quarter where we do a lot of upsells to our existing customers. If you look at Q4 of 2016, that was a 10% sequential growth as well. Whether that seasonality stands or not, what I can say is I feel confident, on average, we will continue to grow that 4% sequentially between now and 2020. There will be variability. Stan Zlotsky : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you. I'm going to start with a question that relates to the previous question. The ACV is very strong. The customer adds was a little bit lower this quarter. I assume it's still a lumpy number, but Mike, you still think you're on target as we look out to 2018 to realize the customer adds you need to keep the model going to those 2020 goals. Is there anything you want to call out in the 23 adds this quarter that was either better, worse or unusual? Michael Scarpelli : Well, what I would say is when we put this goal in place in 2015, we had to add, on average, 20 per quarter. We've been adding well in excess of that now. We just have to have another 160 between now and 2020. So, it's less than 15 per quarter, and I feel pretty good about that as well. Keith Bachman : Yes. And the customer adds in the first three quarters were really strong. Michael Scarpelli : They were. Keith Bachman : Let me ask -- I wanted to ask about -- follow and ask a competitive landscape question. And the question is as follows. Some of the application vendors, particularly in the SaaS world, are -- seem to be earmarking workflow within their applications and perhaps even across their applications as a target market and even mentioning ServiceNow in some discussions as a vendor that perhaps they want to replicate or even begin to compete against. How do you think about the competitive dynamics as you look out now, including some of the narrative provided by some of the application vendors? John Donahoe : Keith, I still say our number one competitor is unstructured workflow, helping customers use software where they're not currently using software. And if you look at a significant portion of our growth, it's simply that. In some cases, we're replacing an old ITSM, legacy-based, prem-based solution. But in many of these onboarding -- customer onboarding, there is no solution out there for that -- or I'm sorry, employee onboarding. And so that's still the largest [Indiscernible]. My view on this is, I think, relatively simple. And again, it comes through the eyes of the customer. What I heard CIOs saying is, I need a few trusted platforms, and I need those platforms to work well together. I need each of you to do what you do really, really well. And you don't have to pretend to be something you're not and the more you can -- the platforms can deliver a seamless experience to the customer and not put all the implementation and integration burden on them across platform, the happier that customer is going to be. Our sweet spot is workflow. This company was founded upon workflow. Our platform was architected for workflow. It's what we have a proven track record of doing. It's what customers are using our out-of-the-box applications for as well as in a huge number of situations using our platform for workflows that, again, we couldn't even imagine in out-of-the-box applications. And so others may be adding some kind of workflow functionality to their features, but it's a more horizontal mindset. Most of these other platforms -- and there are some great platforms there. They're great needed. We use some ourselves, are more horizontal in nature. We're more vertical -- or I'm sorry, they're more vertical in nature, I'm sorry. We're more horizontal. So, I don't view it as a zero something. Cloud is an enormous opportunity, and I think the real responsibility we have is to make sure one plus one equals three for our customers, or one plus one plus one equals five, that the infrastructure providers plus the various software platforms work effectively together to deliver great experience for the customers. So, they may be adding workflow. I know that's what a core focus is. That's what our number one focus is. That's what our -- how our platform is architected and that's what we're going to continue to do. And we intend to be best-in-class and provide outstanding return on investment for our customers. Keith Bachman : All right. Make sense. Mike, hope you feel better. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Kash Rangan from BoA Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. John Donahoe : You want to take this one, Mike, or should I think this one? I think we'll go to the next one, operator. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. I guess this is going to be for John. John Donahoe : Thanks for being here Jennifer. Jennifer Lowe : I show up. That's what I got. So, I had a quick question just around this broader discussion people have been having on tax reform and whether that potentially frees up some more dollars to go into IT budgets. And in particular, it seems like digital transformation is potentially a place where this incremental budget could go to the extent it materializes. I'm curious in your conversation with customers, how are they feeling about IT budgets for 2018? And is there any thought yet whether they might see some benefits from tax dollars being freed up a bit? John Donahoe : Jennifer, it's a great question. It's too early to tell. I will say that yesterday afternoon, I was in our EBC with the CIO of a -- certainly a Fortune 100, large, global, multinational in healthcare. And she said that she had gotten some incremental budget. She was quite excited. She literally got in an airplane, flew out here to talk with us about employee experience and about how she can put that to work on, again, on workflows that were cross-functional. And coincidentally, I was in the EBC this morning with another large, global, multinational who -- again, in this case, it was, I guess, the Head of Infrastructure. And he was saying that he's got good budget this year to really drive cross -- again, cross-enterprise transformation. And I think that's what's beginning to happen, is CEOs, CFOs are realizing that to get the real value out of technology, you can't just fund the vertical departments, the vertical silos. You can't just give IT their money, HR their money, marketing their money, that some of the real power and the value of driving a great customer experience, driving a great employee experience and driving great productivity comes from the cross-functional work. And I think that's what's beginning to get funded more and more, and I think that's somewhat reflected in our growth. Jennifer Lowe : Okay, great. And I have a question for Mike. I apologize. So, hopefully, this is a quick one. And sort of in that same vein, given that tax reform has some incentives for CapEx type decisions and one of the things that determines whether some things are CapEx or an OpEx is if there's the potential to do that as an on-prem deal. I know you'd mentioned, I think, in response the Walter's question that sort of one of the moving pieces is whether new business comes in and wants to have that on-prem optionality or not. Is there any thinking at this point whether the more attractive CapEx depreciation rules might cause you to see a few more on-prem-style deals than you maybe would have seen in the past? Michael Scarpelli : So, I think that it's too early to tell whether we will see more or not. We still have -- a lot of the customers we sell into do have operating budget versus CapEx budget constraints. So, we do see very often that customers want to structure their deals such that they could use their CapEx budget and I do expect that will continue. I'm not sure whether that's going to be any more or less than what we've seen in the past. One would think being able to get the tax write-off right away, you may. But it's too early to tell and we're not forecasting that. Jennifer Lowe : Okay, great. Thank you. And I hope you feel better. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Rob Owens : Great and thanks for taking my question. While I am tempted to ask Mike a six-part question, I think I'll defer to a callback on that front. So, maybe you can expand a little bit on the low-code, no-code opportunity and what that could mean just relative to the installed base and potential expansion there as well as your opportunity in the end market. John Donahoe : Yes, Rob, I think the short answer is we don't really know. But I think we have this platform that customers give us feedback that it's easy to use, it's fast to build on, it's extensible. So, in addition to building outstanding out-of-the-box applications, we're trying to incent the spread of that platform across enterprise. We're going to do it a couple of ways. One, we're investing heavily in our platform-as-a-business. And our platform-as-a-business, that is platform as our product line grew, as Mike mentioned earlier, very attractively last year. So, people are buying the platform with the intent of using it outside of our core applications as well as our core applications. Second, we are ceding the third-party development market, both inside companies and outside companies. So, our store, our ISVs in store grew 100%. 100% net new ACV growth from our partners through our store and OEM program last year. It's still a relatively small program, but it's a way where we can open up the ability to innovate on top of our platform. And we're having a number of OEM partners like Nuvolo and Factor5 and Fairchild who have built applications on top of our platform, often a vertical solution or a specific use case that they're gearing it toward. And then lastly, what the no-code platform is for, the no-code effort is to just make it easier inside the enterprise for non-IT, non-developer employees to extend the use of our platform in ways that even we can't imagine. So, our goal is to unleash the next wave of innovation. Obviously, the more this happens, the stickier our platform becomes. It both opens up new doors of opportunity and makes it stickier. And so I think it's too soon to tell to see how much it's used. Rob Owens : Are there any specific plans to go after that type of base at this point? Or is it just a portion of byproduct of the solution you have? John Donahoe : Now, when you say go after the base, you mean--? Rob Owens : Of people who might be more apt to a no-code type of situation that would extend beyond your traditional IT user. John Donahoe : Yes, it's -- to be honest, this is -- one of the things about innovation is you have different horizons of innovation. We're driving a lot of innovation in our core functionality, fulfiller experience, the things that are very, very associated with our products. And then by things like our ISV in-store, things like this low-code, no-code, instead of spending tons and tons and tons studying it and guessing, we're building what we think are great testbeds and great -- and we're going to follow to where customers lead us, which, to be honest, has been one of the secrets of this company success from the beginning. Fred Luddy built just this wonderful platform. I don't think we ever thought up in some ivory tower that we're going to come up with an HR service delivery product or a CSM product or a security ops product. Frankly, customers pulled us into those applications and we followed them. Or they pulled us into those workflows and we followed them and built an application. And so this is just another way to try to accelerate that penetration into different use cases. And we'll watch it, we'll learn. When we see an opportunity emerge, we'll make our out-of-the-box application. So, too soon to tell, but we -- it's some great engineering work done by Pat Casey and our platform team to build it. Rob Owens : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey going guys. A quick one for John, a quick one for Mike. John, first, can I get your view on how things are progressing in the mid-market/commercial segment of the business? And any changes there in how you're doing competitively? John Donahoe : Commercial has had a good year. And I would say it's a very steady build-out of our team there. I think they're getting their sales motion down. We had a number of greater than $1 million deals in commercial. So it's, I think, $4 million deals in Q4, including three ITSM ones and one CSM one. And so that's where some of our CSM tractions also come. So, commercial is an important part of our business and we'll continue to build it out. And what's also interesting is some of those commercial customers become enterprise customers, right? One of the areas they are targeting is high-growth commercial companies. That would have been ServiceNow a year ago. We would have been a commercial company. We just became an enterprise company. And so we're also trying to target what are those high growth commercial accounts that will then turn into enterprise companies through their success. Michael Turits : Thanks John. And Mike, a quick one for you. I understand why you want to move away from total billings and focus on subscription billings. But just to help us bridge into next year, should we -- what's the level of variability around the expectation for professional services revenues and billings? The Street was looking for like $200 million. Is that something that is roughly right? If we get some idea, then we can bridge to what we're modeling. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. So, when you take out the Knowledge revenue from 2000 -- or from K17 out of that because remember, we re-classed it down into net against the expenses in sales and marketing, the professional service and training will be flat year-over-year roughly for the full year. Michael Turits : Okay. So, that's relative to the stated amount or netting it out? Michael Scarpelli : When you net out the Knowledge revenue for 2017, 2018 will be flat to that. Michael Turits : Okay. Great. Mike thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Taylor Reiners : Hi great. Thanks. This is Taylor Reiners on for Alex. Just had a quick question on security. One of the more interesting partnerships you've announced recently was your partnership with Okta. And I was wondering kind of how you're seeing your partner ecosystem of ISVs such as that drive both deal volumes and deal sizes. John Donahoe : That's interesting. I haven't thought of it that way. What I can -- maybe, Mike, you can think of that. What I'm struck by is the number of partners that want to integrate with our platform because you've got customers saying that they want to -- what I said earlier, our platforms work effectively together. So, in the security area, there's so many different endpoint solutions, so many different platforms. CSOs are looking for how can we help them simplify by working effectively with others. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. What I would say is these partnerships that are being announced by Okta is really a tech partnership and it's better for our customers when there's better alignment. These aren't sales -- these aren't our salespeople doing a partnership to increase our sales. It's delivering a better result for our customers together is what that is about. And we think highly of Okta, use it internally quite a bit and we've been using it for quite some time. We've always had integrations with Okta, and we're just doing a little bit go-to-market with them for our customers to help with that. John Donahoe : I mean, if you think about our own use cases we have now on NOW, Okta is a key part of it. We also announced the integration with Slack in Q4, I believe it was, maybe it's late Q3, which is another example of the fact that our engineers and engineers in companies all over the world want to get tickets through Slack or at least have that option. And so where we see those opportunities that are customer-driven, we'll do deeper, stronger technology alliances to make our products and platform seamless with others because that is what customers want. Taylor Reiners : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on that. I was wondering, at the Analyst Day, one of the more interesting things you mentioned was that roughly half of your CSM customers were actually net new to ServiceNow. And I'm wondering, now that we're seeing net new ACV growth from your other products match ITSM, I was wondering if you can talk about the volume of customers you're seeing that are coming from the other category that are net new to ServiceNow for the first time. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. I would say in general, most of our new customers, typically, we land with ITSM. And CSM and others are add-on. What we have said is we are seeing deals where HR and CSM are leading and opening the door for new opportunities, which enables us to then sell our others. But that is not the norm. Taylor Reiners : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would now like to turn the call back to Michael Scarpelli for any closing remarks. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. John Donahoe : Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. The year is off to a great start, continuing the strong momentum from our record-breaking finish to 2017. Our teams keep executing with strong focus and commitment to customer success. We closed 21 deals in the first quarter with ACV greater than $1 million. The 536 customers now doing more than $1 million in business with us represents year-over-year growth of 43%. And we saw a strong expansion with existing customers. Our opportunity to be a strategic technology partner enabling digital transformation and driving great employee and customer experiences continues to grow. Our performance was strong worldwide with particular strength in EMEA. Nearly half of our top 20 new deals came from outside North America in the quarter, and our renewal rate remained consistently strong at above 98%. Increasingly, our pipeline of new customer deals is diversifying, coming from large public and private companies, as well as government agencies. We see significant growth in opportunities worldwide. For example, one of our largest deals in Q1 was with a $20 billion private company that has over 50,000 employees. And we landed two deals, one at $1.8 million and one at $2.2 million in Q1, with U.S. federal agencies. Our consistent performance underscores our strong product portfolio. We're focused on making work, work better for people. We believe that technology should enable people by creating simpler, faster, easier ways to get work done. That, in turn, creates great experiences for employees and customers and drives better business outcomes. Driving digital transformation and delivering a great employee and customer experience continues to be at the forefront of practically every customer conversation that I have worldwide. And ServiceNow has become a core strategic partner for CIOs and other C-suite executives on their transformation journey. We are uniquely positioned to be the connective tissue that streamlines and simplifies workflows across the enterprise, eliminating silos and creating more seamless interactions. Simply put, we make work, work better. For example, one of our large HR service delivery deals in Q1 was with a global 100 company with 145,000 employees. This is a great example of how companies are looking to partner with us to transform their end-to-end employee experience across their entire enterprise. Customer Success is an important priority for us, and we're making great progress. As I've shared before, we've aligned all of our Customer Success teams, including Customer Success management, professional services, training and certification and our partner ecosystem team into one group, under the leadership of our Chief Revenue Officer, Dave Schneider. This integration will ensure that we optimize value for our customers. We're driving Customer Success to be a natural extension of our sales motion, and our focus is to continue to land new customers and expand existing customer relationships in a healthy and sustainable manner. Delivering world-class product experiences is also a priority for us, and we continue to invest in this area. For example, I'm pleased to share today our acquisition of Seattle-based VendorHawk, a leader in SaaS subscription management. This acquisition further strengthens our software asset management offering, giving customers a comprehensive view of all of their software assets on our single platform. That's critical to managing digital transformation. The all-cash transaction is expected to close this month. Before I close, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Frank Slootman's tremendous contributions to ServiceNow. As you know, Frank has decided to step down from our board and his role as Chairman. I am personally deeply grateful for Frank's partnership and support during my first year at ServiceNow. And I know that everyone here will always appreciate his great leadership. As much as Frank will be missed, I'm also thrilled to announce that our Founder, Fred Luddy, will become our next board Chair. Fred has also been a tremendous partner since I joined ServiceNow, and I look forward to working with him in this role. Finally, I'm delighted to announce a new board member, Dennis Woodside, Chief Operating Officer at Dropbox. Dennis' experience in scaling global technology companies and his focus on creating great customer and consumer experiences will be incredibly valuable for us in the months and years ahead. In closing, I'm very pleased with our strong start to 2018 and the progress we're making against our strategic priorities. We're focused on our purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. That was Fred's founding vision and it's our future aspiration. I'm also excited about sharing more of our journey at our upcoming Knowledge18 event in Las Vegas, the week of May 7. We expect over 18,000 registered attendees, our biggest Knowledge yet. I hope to see all of you there. And with that, I'd turn the call back over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, John. In Q1, we delivered another quarter of outstanding performance, including strong top-line growth combined with margin expansion. After ending 2017 with our strongest quarter ever, it was very important that we started 2018 off on the right foot, and I'm pleased we exceeded our internal expectations. Let's dive into the highlights from the quarter. Subscription revenues for the first quarter were $543 million, representing year-over-year growth of 40% and adjusted growth of 34%. And subscription billings were $638 million, representing year-over-year growth of 33% and adjusted growth of 28%. The subscription billings strength was driven by strong net new ACV performance, favorable foreign exchange gain fluctuations, and a handful of unexpected multi-year billings. Sometimes customers do ask them to bill them for the entire contract upfront to utilize excess cash balances. While we will likely see more of this going forward, we don't expect it to be meaningful in future quarters. We saw strength across all of our products in the quarter with 16 of our top 20 deals including three or more products. In the quarter, we booked three new Customer Service Management deals with more than $1 million of net new ACV and a record six new deals with more than $1 million of net new ACV with our HR Service Delivery product. Strong performance from our emerging products legitimizes the market opportunity in front of us and supports our need to further invest in these areas. Our continued strength in IT, coupled with the success of our emerging products, are yielding more strategic relationships with our customer base. Of the 21 net new deals with more than $1 million in ACV that John mentioned, 20 were upsells. Additionally, 52 customers now pay us more than $5 million per year, which is an increase of 108% year-over-year. Moving on to profitability. Our Q1 operating margin was 18%, the strength of which was driven by our revenue performance, foreign exchange fluctuations, and timing of expenses. Our free cash flow margin was 38% and benefited from a seasonally high amount of collections from our strong Q4 bookings. This quarter also represented the first time we were GAAP EPS profitable, driven by the adoption of two new accounting standards. The first now requires us to record the change in unrealized gains or losses from equity investments during the period on the income statement instead of the balance sheet. The second is related to the indirect tax effect related to the adoption of 606. The total impact of both accounting changes was $41.5 million and we don't expect to be GAAP EPS profitable in Q2 as these aren't recurring gains. Now, let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $568 million and $573 million, representing 41% to 42% year-over-year growth and 36% to 37% adjusted growth. We expect subscription billings between $608 million and $612 million, representing 34% to 35% year-over-year growth, and 28% to 39% adjusted growth. And lastly for Q2, we expect a 16% operating margin, which is impacted by expenses related to our annual users' conference, Knowledge18, and 188 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Coming off our strong Q1, we are raising our full-year 2018 subscription revenue guidance to between $2.4 billion and $2.415 billion, representing 38% to 39% year-over-year growth and 34% to 35% adjusted growth. We're also raising our full-year 2018 subscription billings guidance to between $2.83 billion and $2.845 billion, representing 33% to 34% year-over-year growth and 30% adjusted growth. While we are increasing our top line guidance, we're also increasing our investments and maintaining full-year 2018 margin guidance as follows. Subscription gross margin of 85%, operating margin of 20%, which includes record hiring in Q1 and free cash flow margin of 27%, which includes the opening of a new pair of data centers in Germany later this year. For the year, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 187 million. Before closing, please note our financial Analyst Day will be held on Monday, May 7 in Las Vegas at 1 PM local time. We will also hold a webcast of the event accessible on our website. We plan on updating our financial model beyond 2018 at such time. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of circumstance Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first question just around the incremental focus on Customer Success for John. Can you point to kind of what impact it's having on the upsell motion or the retention dynamics or the customer upgrade cycles? And maybe, Mike, if you can comment what impact, if any, that's having on kind of the way you think about leveraging the model. How big of an initiative multiyear is this program? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Alex. So, I'd say, we're still relatively early in this Customer Success journey. So, the areas we first started on, it's just capturing best practices. This is one of the most requested perspectives from both new and existing customers, which goes something like this, \"you guys now have 4,000 or 5,000 in growing customers, tell us best practice about how we implement the ServiceNow platform.\" And so, you'll see at Knowledge we're rolling out our entire Customer Success Center which just has more best practices that both prospective new and existing customers can use. And I think one of the ways we're seeing that is in some of the newer customers as they implement, they're implementing in a more out-of-the-box way focused on getting the CMBD robust and correct upfront which makes expansion to existing products down the road a lot easier. Another area we're focusing on early on is taking some of our customers that are on older versions or older instances, and working with them, in many cases our PS organization and third-party ecosystem that help them get on a more contemporary version of ServiceNow with less customization and more out-of-the-box functionality. So, I think just the dialogue itself is a filling part of what customers are looking for, as they think of us increasingly as a technology partner, which is, how do they get best value from our platform and where can they use our platform to drive even greater value going forward. So, I think that's partly reflective in the expansion we're seeing, but I think the opportunity is even greater to have that kind of positive impact. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: On the financial side, Alex, as we had said going into 2018, it was one of our key investment initiatives, Customer Success. We planned on $25 million in incremental spending in Customer Success. And that's all factored into the operating margin guidance for 2018. And based upon the results of that that we see in 2018, we'll make a decision going beyond 2018 as to what we're going to invest in that organization. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you, guys. Congrats on a great... Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. A question on new customer adds. New G2K customers, you added 12 in the quarter. That's basically the lowest number I had in my model since 2012. I was wondering if there's any kind of extenuating circumstances that made it a lower new customer quarter add in terms of maybe there's sales changes or a stuff that we should be aware of. Number one. Number two, are you still comfortable with sort of the pace of new G2K customers that we've seen in historical periods continuing into FY 2018? Or are we going to bounce back from these levels? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sure. So, it's really just timing. As you saw, we've been exceeding our G2K ads for quite a few years now, and that was purely timing. The latter half of the year looks very good. But, I can't stress enough, and as John was mentioning, G2Ks was really just a proxy that we gave everyone back in 2015 for how we get to the $4 billion. And we've kind of showed that G2K continues to be north of 50% of our business, but large private companies and public sector are becoming more and more important to us. They're now roughly 38% of our customers paying us more than $1 million per year, and that we see that as a number that will continue to grow. So, I think you'll see us kind of moving away from G2K after 2018, because that was really just to prove to people how we can get to that $4 billion which we feel very comfortable with. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. It makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks very much. And congrats on a good first quarter. John, I was wondering if you could just talk about how some of your discussions with customers are changing just in terms of now being viewed as an enterprise platform. Are you speaking to more people in the C-suite? And when you're able to have those discussions that go beyond just the IT department, what kind of impact can that have on the scope and size of those type of deals? Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, Kirk. I spent a lot of time in Q1, as with last year out, with customers. And I must say, there is remarkable consistency in what I'm seeing and hearing. The first thing I'd note is, I don't think I've visited, I probably had 600, 700 customer meetings. I don't think I've had one yet where the company is not doing a digital transformation on some form or the other. And as part of that, there's no doubt that the role of IT is shifting and expanding. I've said this before. It reminds me of the role of finance over the last 20 years ago. 20 years ago, the CFO was sort of a green eyeshade person, finance was kind of an internal function that didn't have maybe all the respect in the world. They kind of kept track of costs. And over the last 20 years, finance and the CFO are increasingly playing a cross-organization role focused on business value, not just costs, and are far more strategic. And the more I engage with CIOs and see these digital transformations, where CEOs need their most technically literate leader to help lead the digital transformation. I think the CIO and IT are right on the cusp of being the same place that the CFO and finance were 20 years ago, where they're being asked to drive cross-functional change. And as part of that, the CIO has to partner with the other C-suite executive. So, if you're going drive end-to-end employee experience, that's not just an HR issue any more than it's just an IT issue, any more that it's just a legal or facilities issue. Employees just want a great experience, and they want all the functions inside the company to work effectively together. So, we're seeing more and more examples of CIOs partnering effectively with CHROs, with Chief Marketing Officers, with CISOs, obviously some CISOs report to CIOs. And so, I think that cross-functional \u2013 where IT is at the table, not just for vertical functions, but for cross-functional or horizontal functions, is very clear. And that has a very positive impact for us. Because CIOs see the power of our platform and see how it can help automate, transform not just IT processes, but processes that cut across other functions, whether it's customer support, whether it's HR, whether it's security. And so, I think that trend is increasing, and I think it's going to continue. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Looking at the guidance for the year, it looks like you raised billings by kind of the magnitude of the beat normalizing for FX and duration. Given the momentum you had in the quarter, the number of million-dollar deals and the further penetration of G2K, why not take that up at least a little bit to reflect the momentum you have going? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: You know we're still very early on in the year, and a lot of those deals were a function of deals we were thinking were going to happen later. And the deal that happened in Q1, that really doesn't change our billings guidance for the full year. And we'll see as we exit the first half of the year what it looks like the second half, and we'll look at it at that time. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: But I'd say, our confidence in our momentum is not any different than it was. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Correct. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: The momentum is fairly consistent, I would say, over the last several quarters as we see the opportunities. And some of the, frankly, the underlying tailwinds I was talking about in the previous answer. Just as there's increasing pull in demand for our platform and our products. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It's fair enough. And then just maybe one follow-up on the securities side. We're seeing Splunk buying Phantom, et cetera. Just kind of curious what you think the roadmap from here around cyber-security for the platform looks like for ServiceNow. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, we're going to do where were world class at, which is workflow. And so, we're focused on the workflow around security. Security operations, right, which is \u2013 there's an explosion of inbound signals, inbound contacts, inbound incidents. And CISOs are struggling with how to vet all that inbound data and identify which ones are most important and need human attention, which ones can be dealt with an automated function or an automated way. And that's exactly what our workflow engine does. And so, we'll continue to make sure that we are best-in-class at the portion of security we do. And we're going to continue to be Switzerland in the sense that our advantage is we partner with many endpoint detection vendors. And so, we'll never be in the business of actually identifying the threats or vulnerabilities, that's for others to do, but the workflow around it to help remediate those threats, we believe we're best-in-class and we'll continue to be best-in-class. And I think CISOs can increasingly count on us to connect in and integrate with multiple endpoint solutions that they're using. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi, guys. Congrats on a great start to the year. My first question's around upsell and product attach. You had a really nice quarter-on-quarter increase in upsell. You're obviously doing well in diversity of product areas. Do you have any way of measuring your penetration for your larger customers or what the white space opportunity is now that you're in so many different markets at your install base? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: It's a great question, Adam, and it's one we talk about internally in the following sense. The aspiration we have is to be, as I've said repeatedly, a trusted strategic technology partner to companies. And every company has a few top-of-the-house trusted strategic partners. And my customer interactions indicate that, increasingly, CIOs are looking to us to be one of those strategic platforms that's a trusted technology partner. That's kind of step one. Our land motions often with ITSM, and it's great to get a robust ITSM implementation with the strong CMDB. And then it's a matter of just expanding out to the other use cases. And that path of expansion differs by customer. In some customers, it starts with ITSM and includes ITOM early on. Others, employee experiences narrative's getting a lot of focus and attention. And so, what we're very focused on, if there has been an evolution over the last year, is what's the quality of our customer relationships, from a both qualitative and quantitative standpoint? Are we delivering good value for them? Do we have access to the right decision-makers? Are they aware of what our products and platform can do? Do we have a shared perspective on the value creation that's occurring with it? And then second, how do we, in a healthy and sustainable way, expand those customer relationships? In terms of the upside, what's interesting is an awful lot of our growth comes from situations where they're using software, that software has not been used before. Right? So, it's often an unstructured workflow we're replacing. And HR, its on-boarding is an unstructured workflow. This software's not being used today. In most cases, HR case management, software is not being used today. The security use case I talked about in my previous answer, software is not being used today. And so, in many ways, as we look at what's the full potential of our platform inside of a company, or an organization, or more beyond, we think it's an enormous opportunity, because there is a huge opportunity to automate unstructured workflows, and have software drive better experiences and greater productivity. So, we're less focused on measuring the pure TAM or pure maximum potential of each customer, because we think that's huge. We're more focused on, are we building quality implementations, quality relationships, which leads to a healthy and natural and, I believe, very sustainable expansion. Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC : That's super-helpful. If I could just get a quick clarification from Mike, on the quarter-on-quarter margin guidance for Q2, it's obviously down quarter-on-quarter. You mentioned the user conference, is that the entire reason that margins are down quarter-on-quarter, or is there any impact from VendorHawk in that number, or anything else we should be thinking about? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, the users conference is one of those that adds roughly a net $21 million in expenses to the quarter. The other thing is, is Q1, even though we overachieved in bottom line, we did have a record quarter, because we're investing a little heavier in the year, and the full impact, that is going to flow through. The VendorHawk is immaterial from a P&L perspective, from an expense for the balance of this year. Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Maybe going back a bit to just sort of the digital transformation discussions that you've been having, John. Do you find that customers have a very firm sense of what the ROI they expect from these types of transactions is, or is it more sort of big picture, it seems like a good idea type thing, but less specific on the ROI? And how does the perception of that ROI influence the amount that they're willing to spend with ServiceNow? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Jennifer, I think it's in transition, to be honest. So, I would say that \u2013 and the state of play varies today. But in general, sort of the evolution's been, oh, my goodness, software's disrupting my industry, my company. We've got to fight back. Digital, we got to digitally connect with our customers, be they consumer customers or business customers. We've got to provide a better digital experience for our employees and a recognition that digital technology can help drive productivity. And so, sort of across the board, people are embracing digital transformation. I'd say, currently, maybe a quarter of them have tied that to clear cost and productivity goals. Most start with some customer goals and some employee goals and, I think, are getting to the cost and productivity goal third. But that number's growing. And frankly, we're encouraging that to grow, because I think the best transformations come when you reengineer your processes, right. If you just take your old processes, put them on our platform, it's better than it used to be, but you're only scratching the surface of the value. It's only when you re-design or re-engineer or streamline a process and then automate it that you not only get leapfrogged improvements in user experience, but you also get significant productivity savings. And so, we are very clear with our customers that what our platform does is automate workflow, which, by definition, drives productivity. So, you'll see in our website, we've put an economic value creator where we're trying to help, train and encourage CIOs to be able to have that dialogue with CFOs. And increasingly, we're trying to ensure that we have an economic value statement with every customer because it's not only good for the customer, but we think it's good for us, because we think our platform has a very strong positive return on investment. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter, guys. John, a question for you and one for Mike. John, as you're going to market with customer service, HR and more services really outside of the core product, how have you seen your sales process evolve in terms of cross-sell potential? And I'm wondering how much capacity your salespeople have for incremental solutions. And then, Mike, for you, in addition to Q1, I guess, there's a slow point in the year in software, you say it's a good quarter, but it did feel a bit seasonal to me. And the G2K ad was a bit wider (31:03) than I've seen in quite a long time. But your Q2 and your guide implies reacceleration. And you sound very confident about the business momentum. But I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything here, and if that's a fair way to classify the financial momentum in. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, Sarah. What we're seeing inside the customers, the way this demand evolves is what's \u2013 the frequent \u2013 every case is a little bit different, but on average people are using ServiceNow initially for an ITSM or an ITOM integration. And then the CIOs talking with CHRO or the CISO or the head of customer service, and then we get an opportunity with one of them. In some cases, those opportunities start with customer support or customer service. I think we had several deals in the first quarter that our first sale to them was customer service, same thing with HR. But usually, it's in partnership with the CIO. Now, the sales motion that you see is we have added product line specialists, which we're finding to be highly effective. And so, you may have an account rep for a large global multinational combined with a solutions consultant, but for the dialogue with the CHRO they may bring in a product line specialists around HR service delivery. Or for the dialogue with the head of customer support, or customer service, we'll bring in a product line specialist with customer service management. And so having that credibility on the product and credibility with that decision maker, we find to be very effective. But we're not trying to freeze IT out, which I think's a really important point. Because IT is playing a growing cross-functional role and a more important role. A growing number of CIOs are not direct reports to CEOs and are at the C-suite table. The best solutions come when IT partners with their functional counterparts. And so we're trying to make sure that our coverage model covers both. And so far so good. I think the area we probably grew our sales force the most this year is in the product line, I know this, in the product line specialist area. And that's where we continue to see really strong demand. The last thing I'll say is, we're also \u2013 in some certain verticals in government a little bit, in MED/SLED, we're also augmenting that with more vertically focused sales teams. And where it's vertical expertise is more important than product expertise, we're trying to make sure we have that available as well. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And, Sarah, on your... Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: ...on your question for me, yeah, Q1 is typically one of the slowest quarters of the year coming off our best quarter, Q4, from a bookings perspective and net new business. But Q1 is also the quarter where we typically do most of our hiring in Q1. We like to get everyone in front of our sales kickoff. It's also our quarter when we're rolling out commissions and whatnot. So, it is a tough quarter. We did exceed our plan, very pleased with that. And our pipeline going into Q2 is very strong. And we gave you guidance for what we see for Q2 in the balance of the year right now, and I look forward to discussing it more, our actual results, next quarter. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Awesome. Thank you, Mike. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And, sorry you mentioned the G2K. I'll just say this. Our sales team doesn't incent on new G2Ks. So, Dave Schneider, Kevin Haverty, that's not a top priority incentive for them, because we want to ensure we're expanding our relationships as well as adding new ones. And so, as Mike said, the quarter-to-quarter, how many G2Ks happen to land in a quarter is a little bit. It's not a goal we manage to. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Correct. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: We're managing to healthy, expanding relationships. We want to be adding a lot of new ones. We're adding government ones. We're adding large private companies. Increasingly smaller companies, we're adding more, so it's a little bit of a lumpy figure that doesn't necessarily indicate. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Yeah. Thank you. And congrats, guys, on a great start to a year. So, Mike, as you move towards the service management around more automated workloads and some of the other areas outside of IT, can you speak to the evolution of your pricing model as you're moving some of the things towards transaction-based pricing. What's that transaction-based pricing mix today, and how should we expect it? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, pricing is something where we're having a lot of discussions internally. And by the way, we've been having lots of discussions around pricing for the seven years I've been with the company. So this is nothing new. Ultimately, we do believe that the pricing model has to be based on a transaction model, especially when you have, when AI and machine learning is doing more and more, because theoretically, you should reduce the number of users. I think that's still a little too early and very, very little of our business today is on a transaction level. I think that will be very different in three or four years from now, though, but we're still working on that. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: One of the interesting things to make this not just a simple decision is, on one hand, it's very compelling to say I want to buy by the drink, I want to buy by transactions. But to be honest, the higher priority that we hear from customers today is predictability, because they get an annual budget, and they've got to live within that annual budget. And so, given the choice of a volume-based pricing mechanism that they could, they're only paying for what's being used, versus predictability, at least today, they're choosing predictability. Now that we think will evolve over time, but it does make it an interesting dilemma. Yes. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Question for Mike. Mike, the guide for 30% adjusted subscription billings growth for 2018 implies at least a modest second half growth acceleration. I'm just curious, what you're seeing in the pipeline that would cause that. And as you look at the pipeline, where you might have a little bit more of the second half SKU on subscription billings, relative to prior years. Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So, one of the things you need to remember is, most of our billings actually comes from contracted backlog and not from net new business. Q4 is always our biggest year. Q4 of 2017 was such a big year. And we have the second year billings that flow through in Q4 that gives us the confidence as well as the pipeline that we see for our net new business. But I can't stress enough, the majority of our billings is really coming from our backlog and renewals that we're doing versus net new business with customers. Net new is still very strong. But that contracted backlog is really what's driving that, and skewing it to Q4, and I think you'll continue to see that skewing in future years. Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. That's helpful, Mike. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Question, I guess, for either of you. On the platform business, with respect to ISVs starting to drive traction there, can you update us on where that is? And in what areas you see the most promising ISV efforts, and when do you think that will become a more meaningful driver in the platform business? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, Walter, it was a record quarter for our ISV business. Now, I would still say it's a record quarter and I still consider it a relatively small part of our business today. But we had 56 new applications and integrations that were launched in the store in Q1. We had a great example of where Nuvolo, who is a pure-play ServiceNow ISV enterprise software asset management vendor, actually closed the largest deal in our program's history with a $1.8 million deal to a Global 2000 customer. And it was a great example where they had built, what I'm going to characterize is a, tailored vertical solution to a vertical use case on top of our platform. Something that we never would have built out of the box, and it was very effective. And so, I'd still characterize our ISV efforts in the reasonably early days. I think we have a good leadership there. We have increased focus. At Knowledge, we'll be having our CreatorCon day, which we're reaching out more to developers, both inside and outside the enterprise, reaching out more to third-parties, making it easier for them to build applications on top of our platform. And to be honest, as we become more widespread, more global, I think you're going to see increased growth in this, because they're the ones that can provide \u2013 I learned this in my prior life, in my eBay days. It was the very specific use cases, the vertical use cases, sometimes a geographic specific use case that you can get a third-party partner built on our platform and deliver a great solution. So, we're going to continue to grow it, continue to focus on it, and I think it'll be an increasingly important part of our ability to both expand and to deliver great value for our customers. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. John, when we talked to some of your biggest GSI partners, we continue to hear a lot of excitement, I guess in terms of the momentum within their ServiceNow practices that they're building. I was wondering if you can give us an example maybe on how some of these GSIs are influencing deals today, and kind of how do you think about that. I know you've talked about that from a service's perspective, but how should that impact your growth longer term? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I think it's a really important partnership for two reasons, Matt. One is to ensure that the product and platform get implemented effectively, which that then tees up. The more effective and better implemented the ServiceNow platform is, the more expansion happens quickly, easily and effectively. And so, there's a shared incentive to ensure we're getting it right. And that's sort of been the starting point. I've had top to top meetings in the first quarter, top to top meetings with Accenture, DXC, Deloitte, KPMG, IBM, all of them. And we start with saying how are we ensuring that collectively we're driving highly successful outcomes, highly successful results at our shared customers, because I think everyone's clear, when that happens, expansion happens in a more fast and robust manner and a healthy manner. And then in terms of going to market together, again, for the first time really ever, we have shared account plans with each of those five strategic accounts. And so, we're talking about what industry verticals or what geographies, or how do the right people in our sales team talk to the right people in the GSI organizations so that we can go to market together in a way that's good for customers? And so, again, I'd put this as one of these initiatives that it's \u2013 I think we're ahead of where we were 12 months ago, and I think we can take a big step going forward. And over time there's no doubt that our partner ecosystems plays an incredibly important role to our growth and to our Customer Success. And so, I think we'll continue to see focus on that. The other thing we're doing that I think the more successful partners appreciate is, we're raising the bar where if you don't have current certification on ServiceNow, we've gone from a very open partner ecosystem to one that's more if you're not trained and certified, then you're not part of our partner ecosystem. And so, the ones that are trained and certified, we're working with them to how to increase the number of ServiceNow trained consultants that they have. So, important and I think of growing its importance over time. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is now open. J. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. John, as you expand the product portfolio and see more multiproduct engagements touching different constituents, different price structures, I suspect ultimately sales cycles could get a little longer. I mean, you guys have done a great job managing that so far. But how are you ensuring that sales cycles close rates don't get too long? And do you envision, do you see linearity changing at all as you do more strategic engagements? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Derrick, I think this is \u2013 I can't say I have a deep understanding of the sales cycles of other enterprise software use cases. Although in many cases, those are major fundamental decisions to take out one existing software and put in another. As I said earlier, what in essence happens, once we're in a customer with our platform, the decision's not so much to rip out an old software and put in ServiceNow. It's, do I use ServiceNow where software is not being used today? And so as a result, I think the decision cycles are not these big broad bake-off questions. They're, hey, on facilities management, should we be using ServiceNow to help extend, automate this workflow? Or should we add ServiceNow's Security Operations capability to automate the incident response in CISO and security, in addition to the other use cases, or in addition to the other software endpoint solutions we're using. And so, if you look at how we grow our relationships, it's often, I would say, a lot of little pieces, rather than one great big fundamental decision. Often, the first decision of whether to use us for ITSM is, are they going to upgrade over a long-term remedy or a long-term HP or a long-term CA solution? But the expansion tends to be almost workflow by workflow. And that's, I think, one of the things that allows us to have a little bit more consistency and predictability around the expansion at a macro level. Would you agree with that, Mike? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: No, I would agree. And Derrick, in seven years, I really haven't seen a material change in the initial sales cycle. It is still very much, on average, a nine-plus month sales cycle for an enterprise customer. G2Ks on average are, believe it or not, two years. We gave examples a couple quarters ago, where it's a five year. But once they're in, there tends to be more of a repeat buying pattern. And as John said, it tends to be workflow by workflow, and really not replacing software beyond that initial ITSM implementation. J. Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Your phone may be on mute. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry about that, it was indeed on mute. Good call. First off, congrats on hiring Dennis Woodside to your board. And Dennis, in case you're listening on the call, congrats on joining the ServiceNow board. A couple questions for you guys. One, with respect to the margin guidance being a little bit lower, is it fair to read into the tremendous outperformance in billings, and since you're raising the billings guidance, that obviously comes at the expense of operating leverage. But it's all good, because the faster the billings grow, you'll ultimately recover the profitability. So, we shouldn't be \u2013 it is a tradeoff between outperforming and billings versus giving up some margins, right? Is that the right way to look at the tradeoff? Then my follow-up... Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Can I just answer that before you ask your next question? Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: We kept our margin guidance at 20% for the full year. We have not lowered it, and we're giving you higher revenue that that margin is after, that we are contributing more on an operating profit basis. And we did mention Q1 was a record hiring quarter. A lot of that hiring was at the end of the year. And the full impact of that is flowing through for the rest of the year, and we're still keeping our margin at 20% for the year. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That sounds fantastic. All the things that growth companies do. A rather philosophical question, look at successful SaaS companies, and one of the largest being salesforce.com. They've got lot of adjacencies at scale, besides sales force automations. In your case, you've got ITSM. As you look at the company business five, six years out, how does the company look like? Your best estimate as to what those multiple adjacencies that are potentially multibillion-dollar businesses, so the growth doesn't have to necessarily slow down, because you're uncovering new TAMs. Philosophically, how does a company look like with respect to adjacencies in addition to ITSM at scale five, six years out? That's it for me. Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Kash, again, I'll just echo on what I've touched on a couple times before. I think the reason software industry is growing so much and the reason SaaS is growing so much is software's now being used in areas that it wasn't being used previously inside the enterprise, right? So, when I talk about a strong cloud tailwind, what I'm talking about is the need to do digital transformation is causing people to embrace cloud aggressively. And that's causing, what I would call, structural growth in software. And so, in our particular case, given our focus on workflow, we've done a couple analyses of, well, what's the workflow TAM inside of a company? If you were to take all of the unstructured workflows or all the non-automated workflows, what was it, Mike? We got the trillions of dollars and then we decided, you know what, actually, when you get to that, it \u2013 the point is, we have a big opportunity. And so, I think what we're now focused on doing \u2013 and I'd tell you one other thing that I just love about our platform that is very reminiscent of what I experienced at eBay, which was we follow our customers. Our growth's following our customers. So, at eBay, when Pierre Omidyar created eBay, and he created it for initially collectibles, Beanie Babies and collectibles in an auction format, he never envisioned there'd be 3 million cars sold on the eBay platform, or hundreds of billions of consumer electronics in a fixed-price format. Customers just started using the platform for multiple buying and selling. And so, the expansion happened following the customers. That's very much consistent with what we see here, where customers are using our platform, and they start using it in these use cases. It's not us saying oh, well, we're going to create an HR service delivery use case. It was actually, no, they started saying, you know this thing we're doing with IT help desk? We can do it with HR help desk. And so they started building their own solutions on our platform around HR help desk. And they said, hey, could you build that out of the box? And we say, yes, we can. And so literally, one of our biggest challenges right now is the number of requests where our customers want us to build out-of-the-box applications for workflows that they're currently had built their own use cases on our platform. And so, our now X which you've heard us talk about before, what that is focused on is taking all those ideas from our customers, from our employees, from third-party developers and saying how do we prioritize what our next applications are? And that we're going to try to address in a very systematic way. But medium to longer term, we see just significant upside, significant expansion potential as we increasingly automate workflows inside an enterprise to deliver higher productivity, better employee experiences and better customer experiences. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And we think we're the best-positioned company to do that given that we have everything on one platform, one code base, one set of user profile, very easy to deploy these workflows around and across the entire organization. And I can't stress enough, we are not a system of record. We're not trying to replace HCM. We're not trying to replace ERP. It's all around the work around these systems that we're doing to help people. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : John and Mike, I feel 20 years younger. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Good. Tell me what you're doing because I'd like to feel 20 years younger, too. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just listening to you. I just listened to you, that's it. The last two minutes, that changes everything. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And to be clear, and I've said this since I joined this company, guys, I'm reflecting what I'm hearing from customers. That's what's so exciting. I come back from these customer visits -- just seeing the potential to transform how work's done. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And not many companies at your size have grown 40%, very few in history. So, congrats. Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair. Your line is now open. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Mike, when you look at the 30% of ACV that's coming from the emerging products, I think the assumption is that the vast majority of that is selling back to your install base. I guess, is that the right assumption? And maybe for John, the Customer Success side of things seems like it's going incredibly well early on. I guess, where are some of your areas you're seeing success, whether it's verticals, customer sizes, et cetera? Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. I will say a big percentage of the emerging products is sold into our install base of customers. But I can't stress enough. As we said before, we have done many large transactions with new customers with CSM and our HR Service Delivery product. And so they can open the door up for opportunities that will then, in the future, lead to ITSM and other products being sold. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Justin, on the Customer Success, the way I would characterize it is this : we're a company in evolution; to be honest, we're a company that that five years ago, started selling probably three, four levels beneath the CIO, and we were selling part of a single solution or a single product. So, we were kind of a vendor selling deep into IT. And what's happened, because of our strong platform, because of the good delivery of our products, is we're clearly moving up the organization. So increasingly, our dialogue's with the CIO, and where the dialogue's increasingly moving from being a vendor to a partner. And I view Customer Success is simply something that reinforces that trend, that momentum. And to be honest, some of the earliest successes we've had with Customer Success to-date is actually having tough honest conversations with customers. Because what can so often happen is, they buy ServiceNow, and implementation gets delegated down. When it gets delegated down, it ends up getting slower, or getting more customized, or they don't re-design the processes. So, by having the capabilities, and the people that can have that discussion upfront that says, hey, here's best practice. I was with a customer last week who was extremely excited by our portfolio. This particular CIO was in a EBC visit. And we were talking about four, five, six different applications, and I was in with one of our Customer Success people saying, let me tell you best practice. Best practice is you start off with ITSM, get that implemented really well and get a great CMBD implemented well. Then, sequentially, add the next application. Right? Now it would have been easy to say, I'll do everything at once, but that wouldn't have led to as good an outcome 12, 18 months down the road. And I can tell you that customer very much appreciated the fact that we had a point of view, the fact that we were putting their interest before ours in the short-term, and I actually believe that customer will implement more effectively, and over a three to five-year period, that will be a larger, happier customer. And so, it's no one thing, but it is bit of attitude that says, how do we live up to what they're looking to us to do, which is to be a strategic partner that shares our best practice, shares our own experience and puts their interests first. And the manufacturing process to do that is still early days, as we build the muscle to do that as part of our routine account coverage muscle, but the feedback's been very positive thus far. Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Mike, just one quick one for you. I wanted to ask about the average contract terms for new customers at 37.3 months. It looks like the highest ever. And I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on what's driving such a big jump in the duration of new customer contracts. Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. We had one large private company, that John mentioned, was one of our biggest deals in the quarter that that customer wanted a five-year contract. And we had a couple of other relatively large deals where customers there's one that had a seven-year contract. In general, nothing has changed in our business. I think that was really skewed this quarter. I think it'll go back to being around between 34 and 36 months, because we just incent our sales force to sell a three-year contract. There's no additional incentive for our salespeople to sell beyond three years. And these are just really customers pushing those. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, John. In your prepared remarks, you noted a number of large CSM deals. Can you give us a sense of what verticals those were in, or maybe the use cases? And were those deals competitive versus salesforce's service cloud? Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: You know the use case, Jesse \u2013 if I were to describe where our target segment is in customer service, it tends to be industries or companies that have a high number of inbound contacts, where the goal is to get to the root cause and address the root cause so that you reduce contacts in the future. That's as contrasted with the goal being spending a lot of time on the phone with them. And if you want to spend a lot of time in the phone with them, you probably want more of a CRM-based customer support or customer service technology. However, if your goal \u2013 and increasingly technology companies, financial services companies, services businesses, their goal is to actually use the inbound customer contact channel not just to resolve a customer's problem but actually to get to the root cause. And so you need a cross-functional workflow. A cross-functional platform. And that's where we shine, right. That's where we shine. And so, on average, telecom, software, technology, services businesses, financial services are some of the industries where we tend to do well. And there's no one competitor that we're placing. To be honest, I think increasingly customer service is such a large market that the leading edge customer service decision makers are realizing that different platforms optimize for different things. And so, our goal is to frankly be spending more time in the circumstances and situations where our capability fits what they need and less time in bake offs where we aren't the best solution. And so, I think we're doing a pretty good job with that. We're definitely more focused in our targeting today than we were a year ago, and that's why I think you see a little bit of that success I described in my remarks. Let me just give you a quick example just to wrap up, Telstra is one of our customer service customers. And they want \u2013 so, Telstra is a financial services company \u2013 or I'm sorry, a telecom in Australia. And they wanted to reduce the number of time of their calls. And using the ServiceNow platform they've gone from 15 minutes to 6. They want to spend \u2013 they were sending technicians out on many cases where a technician was not needed. So, they've been able to reduce unnecessary technician visits by 55%. And they have a real focus on how do they use the data. This is in a world of machine learning and data. All the data they get from one of the calls, the inbound contacts, what are they calling about and how do we get to the root cause so that we can fix it within our network so that those calls don't happen in the future and we have more satisfied customers. And so, a nice example of our customer service product with one of the leading telecom providers in the world. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, John. That's very helpful. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: I think that's it. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. So, thank you, everyone. With that, operator, we're going to end the call. And as a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today.

I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We had a strong second quarter, continuing our global momentum as we head into the second half. Our teams keep executing well, with the sharp focus and commitment to customer success. We closed 28 deals with ACV greater than $1 million in Q2, up 47% over the prior year. We now have 575 customers doing more than $1 million of business with us. We also doubled the number of customers doing more than $5 million with us to 58. And our largest customer is now doing more than $25 million, leveraging our IT and HR Service Delivery products to drive digital transformation, and enable great employee experiences. Our Knowledge event in May was the second quarter highlight for me. This year's Knowledge was our biggest ever, with more than 18,000 registered attendees, and it was great to see many of you there. I'm always energized by spending time with our customers and partners, and this year's Knowledge was no exception. My individual customer meetings, conversations with CIOs and interactions with hundreds of attendees, reinforced our opportunity. Digital transformation is no longer just a business buzzword. It's fast becoming an essential business priority for C-suite leaders worldwide. I hear this in virtually every customer interaction I have. And ServiceNow is becoming a strategic partner of choice to help these customers enable their digital future. Our consistently strong renewal rate, 98.5% in Q2, and our strong expansion with existing customers underscore the increasingly strategic role that we're playing. Another highlight of the quarter was our recognition by Forbes magazine as the World's Number One Most Innovative Company. This was the first year we were eligible for the list. So debuting at Number One was gratifying validation of our commitment to innovate for our customers, to enable their success. And it was a proud moment for everyone here at ServiceNow to see our Founder and Board Chair, Fred Luddy on the cover of Forbes. We were also excited to launch our new brand identity at Knowledge18, bringing to life our company purpose, to make the world of work, work better for people. We believe that technology should enable people by creating simpler, faster and better ways to get work done; that creates great experiences for employees and customers, and drives better business outcomes. We are uniquely positioned to be the connective tissue that streamlines and simplifies work flows across the enterprise, eliminating silos and creating more seamless interactions. We make work, work better. And as I said earlier, product innovation is a huge priority for us. We announced several exciting new products at Knowledge, including Virtual Agent, Agent Workspace, Enterprise DevOps, Integration Hub and Flow Designer. These demonstrate our commitment to creating great products that allow our customers to build great employee and customer experiences. In Q2, we continue to see strength across our product portfolio with our flagship IT product suite leading the way. For example, a large U.S. government agency has evolved with us over the past four years to become one of our biggest customers today. They're using our IT products to standardize their services and to map and better manage their software technology across multiple systems. And we're working closely with them to develop a longer-term digital transformation strategy, and deepen our partnership to enable their success. Customer success is indeed an important priority for us, and we continue to make good progress. As I've mentioned previously, we have aligned all of our customer success teams into one group under the leadership of our Chief Revenue Officer, Dave Schneider. We are driving customer success to be a natural extension of our sales motion, and are committed to not only landing new customers, but also expanding existing relationships in a healthy and sustainable manner. For example, our customer success approach enables United Airlines to better serve their customers. Our leader for United has orchestrated various initiative teams and resources in their digital transformation journey, resulting in a more focused strategy to drive business outcomes. In closing, I'm pleased, in fact, very pleased with our strong quarter and our first half performance. We have strong momentum as we look into the rest of the year, and we're making continued progress against our strategic priorities. We look forward to helping our customers succeed and to create the future of work. With that, I'll turn the call back over to, Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, John. Our strong momentum continued in Q2, and we delivered another quarter of outstanding performance. Before we dive into the financial results for the quarter, I want to remind everyone that we bill our customers in local currencies and are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily the euro and the British pound. The guidance we provide is based on the spot rate at the end of the prior quarter. In Q2, the euro decreased 5% and the British pound decreased 6%, both of which impacted our reported results in Q2. In total, our Q2 subscription revenue and billings results were impacted by approximately $7 million each due to the quarterly fluctuation in FX rate. Please review the IR presentation on our website for more detail on the FX impact in the quarter. Now, let's look at the highlights from Q2. Subscription revenues were $585 million, representing year-over-year growth of 45% and constant currency growth of 42%. Subscription billings were $617 million, representing year-over-year growth of 36% and constant currency and duration growth of 32%. The strong top-line performance was driven by all products in the quarter, especially IT. We booked a record new seven ITOM deals with more than $1 million of ACV, including a $4 million deal to a major financial institution, our largest new customer ITOM deal ever. We also saw our first $1 million Software Asset Management deal to a top-five customer. Outside of IT, we landed three $1 million-plus deals in HR Service Delivery, all of which were outside of North America, and our Governance, Risk, and Compliance product was named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Integrated Risk Management. Our GRC product provides continuous monitoring and automation, while connecting business, security and IT teams with an integrated risk framework built on a single platform. Risk and compliance has never been more important to our customers, and we're very excited about the potential of this product across many different customer use cases. Moving on to profitability. Our Q2 operating margin was 17% and our free cash flow margin was 24%, driven by strong top-line performance and a shift of expected program expenses into Q3. Now, let's turn to guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2018 based on the spot rates at the end of the second quarter. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $610 million and $615 million, representing 36% to 37% year-over-year growth and constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $648 million and $653 million, representing 29% to 30% year-over-year growth and 30% to 31% constant currency and duration growth. Due to the decrease in FX rates during Q2 I mentioned earlier, we removed $12 million and $13 million from Q3 subscription revenues and billings guidance, respectively. And lastly for Q3, we expect a 21% operating margin. Now, let's turn to our full-year 2018 guidance. Coming off a strong first half in 2018, we are raising full year subscription revenue and billings guidance when adjusted for FX rate changes. We expect subscription revenues between $2.405 billion and $2.415 billion, representing 38% to 39% year-over-year growth and 36% to 37% constant currency growth. This includes a $33 million increase, offset by a $31 million decrease due to changes in FX rates from our previously issued guidance. We expect subscription billings between $2.815 billion and $2.825 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth and 31% constant currency and duration growth. This includes a $21 million increase, offset by a $38 million decrease due to changes in FX rates from our previously issued guidance. Moving on to margins, we are maintaining full-year subscription margins of 85%, operating margin of 20%, and free cash flow margin of 27% as we continue to invest in future growth. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 187 million for the year. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, and congrats on the strong quarter. John, in regards to customers' digital transformation, I mean, that was a key focus at your user event, and you talked about on the prepared remarks. Partners we talk to refer to ServiceNow as the platform of platforms. So I guess, I'm wondering, I know initial sales cycles can be long, but conceptually how does that positioning help with the land side of the equation? And then secondarily, from an expansion perspective, do you have any idea what inning we're at in terms of penetration in your base from all your new apps? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Matt. I think, the biggest effect as I said, this digital transformation, it was just stunning to me. It's now in a multi-hundred customer meetings how consistent that's coming up. And because every industry and every company is being disrupted by software, every company is embracing digital technology. And it's now become a C-suite CEO issue. And the effect that's having on us is, it's pulling up the awareness of ServiceNow's platform in the enterprise, where CIOs, I think, increasingly the question is not, do you use ServiceNow to why are you not using ServiceNow, and how broadly can you use ServiceNow to help drive your digital transformation. So I'd say the biggest change we see is, we're getting almost pulled up, pulled up the enterprise as we move along. Now, I think one of the strengths of this company is that, our land motion, it's not one gigantic platform play. While we're being pulled up, it's not like you've got \u2013 rip out some big old platform that's legacy, and put in ours. So you see us often land with ITSM, although increasingly as you saw, I think, it's 17 of our top 20 deals, we had three or more products in Q3. And so, what's happening is, as this digital transformation awareness is happening, they often land us in IT, and then they'll add either ITOM or HR Service Delivery or Security Ops. And even when they don't land those things, initially we're having active dialogs in that. So I think, as I said in my remarks, we're becoming more strategic, and that word, platform of platform just something or connective tissue is something I hear frequently from our customers as well. With regards to what inning? Matt, I would say, let me answer that, that there's a macro tailwind of cloud. And I would say, cloud is in the second or third inning of enterprises, governments and institutions embracing cloud, it reminds me of mobile may be in 2014. So I think we're in the third inning of the cloud tailwind. And therefore, when we look at our share of wallet, so to speak, a share of what we think we can grow in many of these customers, I think, we're \u2013 I don't know, a quarter of the way there, max, more like maybe 20%. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclay. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks, and congrats from me as well. And can you talk to the strength in ITOM? Mike, you've mentioned the $4 million deal in financial services. And if you look at the market size for ITOM, it's bigger than ITSM. So was that something specific at that customer or is that kind of like something that could happen kind of more often? Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Raimo. What happened at that customer, first of all, ITOM had a strong quarter. As Mike said, we had seven ITOM deals over $1 million, and 17 of our top 20 deals in the quarter included ITOM. But what's happened in this particular financial institution, I think, is emblematic of what we're seeing more broadly. This financial institution recently appointed a new CIO. And this CIO is shaping us, in this case it's a he, his strategy for IT. And he wants to run IT as a business. And because he's in financial services, he's got a lot of regulatory and compliance requirements along the way. And so, as he shaped his strategy, ServiceNow was one of the core pillars of that strategy in a very strategic way. And so, he's using our ITOM products to replace a number of legacy tools, and replacing them with the modern ServiceNow platform to drive huge efficiencies, and to give him better data. So they had significant disaster recovery and business continuity challenges, and those had regulatory implications. And he's now using ServiceNow to spring automation and integration of these other core systems that allows him to both streamline his work flows, to drive the automation which drives better productivity, but also gives him the data and monitoring and tracking so that he can be compliant and confident of his compliance. And so, I think it's \u2013 ITOM's a bit of a lumpy business, so we won't have $7 million deals in every quarter. But we're seeing it, increasingly our customers are seeing our ITOM suite if you will as being strategic to their ability to run IT as a business. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Very clear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Thanks very much. I'll echo the congratulations on the quarter. I don't know who wants to take this, John or Mike, but one of the things that's come up in a lot of our discussions is clearly the excitement around ServiceNow-as-a-platform in the federal government. And I was just wondering if you guys could talk about, sort of how that maybe influenced this quarter, and sort of your thoughts obviously going into the federal government's fiscal year end and the third quarter. And just kind of how \u2013 I'm trying to get a sense, you had a big lift this quarter or is a lot of that starts to come as we head into 3Q? Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. Well, Kirk, I spent a week in D.C. in the quarter. I was in Sydney, where I met the Prime Minister, I was in UK, we met federal government. So federal governments everywhere are embracing cloud. Now, in some places, they're embracing their own cloud, they're building their own cloud, so they show up as slightly on-prem for us. But this notion of, governments are under pressure to deliver better citizen experiences, lower cost or more efficiency, and increase the speed in which they move. And so ServiceNow, whether it's the military services or the defense and other departments or other departments are increasingly embracing cloud and they're embracing ServiceNow. So we see that as a broad trend that I still think is, in its fairly early days. And so, as I look at it quarter-to-quarter, maybe Mike, you can comment on the seasonality, but the \u2013 I think, this is a trend that you're going to see continuing. And it's not just federal governments, frankly state and local governments, some of the most creative use cases for using ServiceNow. I was in Australia and one of the regional port authorities there is using the ServiceNow Platform to drive their bus lines, to drive all sorts of the activities within the port. So very creative use cases are coming out of state and local as well. You want to comment about seasonality Mike? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. So we did have a good quarter in the federal in Q2. We actually did a very big upsell to a customer. But Q3, we have a very robust pipeline, and as you'd expect Q3 will be our largest quarter for federal as well as a big renewal period for federal. And as John mentioned, many of our federal customers, they are embracing, and they are embracing the cloud, but many of them, they're in their own private clouds where they're deploying it, so that is on-prem. About 38% of our federal government business is on-prem or they're ripe to go on-prem, so that gets accounted for differently under Topic 606. And I would add, public sector in general, there's a lot of opportunity for the company as a whole, it's still less than 10% of our revenue. And that's globally when you look at the public sector. Very, very big market opportunity for us. And we are investing heavily in our sales organization to go after the public sector, globally. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And as Mike said, I think at Analyst Day, it's one of the reasons why we think G2K is no longer the best indicator of our largest customers and our largest targets, because government's not included in there. And we have several... Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Correct. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: ...the government opportunity for us both federal, and state and local in the U.S., and globally is a significant one. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right, great. Thank you so much. And congrats on the quarter, guys. I have a lot of questions, but I think the slide that stands out to me is the top 20 deals slide in terms of the diversification you're seeing there. And inter-quarter, we had a lot of incomings questions around ServiceNow's pricing due to how much success you're having in emerging product uptake, which frankly we really couldn't find any signs of any real changes in your go-to-market. So I thought it would be useful and helpful if you could talk about how you think about pricing today? And how it evolves as you start to deal with some of these larger and bigger upsell and renewal deals? Thanks, guys, and congrats. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Sarah. Let me separate pricing into two separate but minorly-related issues. Issue one is the magnitude of our pricing, right? The pricing levels. And the reality is, we do not feel a lot of downward pressure on our pricing, because our platform delivers value. And you've heard me talk about before, one of the most important foundations of our Customer Success efforts is continuing to clearly demonstrate, document business value that our platform's driving, right? We drive productivity, in simple terms, workflow automation drives productivity. And so our platform delivers a clear return on investment, and we need to continue to document that and make that clear. That's the best way to maintain the pricing levels, is to demonstrate the clear return on investment and value that our customers are getting. And we will continue to do that. Where we're hearing more comment and feedback is, just the complexity of pricing. And this is a relatively simple thing. What's happening, where we've gone from \u2013 we haven't changed our core pricing approach in years, but we've gone from one application, ITSM, which is priced by fulfiller, to where we now have five, six or seven different applications, each of which has a different variable on which it's driven. So HR Service Delivery may be driven by number of employees. Or Security Operations may be driven by number of incidents, inbound incidents. And so each is optimized for what customers want. But when you're buying five, six or seven of them, it can be somewhat complex. And so, we've been talking with customers about how do we simplify that? And we've experimented with enterprise-wide licenses, and a couple of customers were looking at \u2013 some customers said, they want to only pay for what they're using; so we say great. We want to do transactional pricing. We can structure it that way. But other customers say, no, we want the predictability of having a budget. They need an annual budget, they want predictability, and that's where you get back to our subscription pricing. So there's no simple solution to the complexity. It's not just us. It's all enterprise software or frankly all SaaS software. But one of the things we're doing is forming a Strategic Pricing Group to help work with our customers to model out what they're buying and make it in \u2013 reduce the complexity. I do not think, again, I'll end the answer with where I started. We do not feel downward pressure necessarily at all, it's more a complexity issue. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And one we're trying to work on. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. That is extremely helpful. I really appreciate all the detail and color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, thank you very much. I also wanted to refer back to Analyst Day. And the context of the question is, ServiceNow has been very successful into moving into new markets such as HR, Security, CRM, doing very well, and yet has expanded margins while also penetrating new markets. And one of the ideas put out at Analyst Day was, as you move into additional markets, your margin expansion is going be much more constrained. And so, I'm just trying to tie together why in the past have you been able to get into new markets and expand margins. And as you just alluded to, you're not experiencing pricing pressure; CIOs in fact want to pull you up. Why would there be more margin pressure or less margin upside if you will when you've been very successful moving into new markets in the past? That's it from me. Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sure, Keith. I'll take this, and Mike, I'm sure you'll want to comment as well. Keith, from my standpoint it has to do with the opportunity in front of us. You get these windows when you're a technology company when \u2013 as you mentioned, we have three or four products or applications firing on all cylinders and opportunity to do more. I want to make sure that we're investing enough to take advantage of this opportunity while we have it. And as I said in Analyst Day, we can't invest more this year. We're not changing what we're doing this year. But if I think about investing in innovation, and so we talked about our NowX investment, which is investing in the next-gen products and services at Analyst Day; investing in other platform extensions over time. We're going to continue to invest in technology, in our product and in our platform. Second, we're investing in the Customer Success motion. The customers now expect us to provide end-to-end service, right? And they're looking to us to provide best practices. They're looking for us not just to sell something and show up three weeks later at renewal, because we're becoming a strategic partner. Initially, that's an investment. I believe that will lead to faster expansion or more significant expansion over time. Third, we're growing out our global team and investing in talent. And then last, we're investing in our company brand, something we've never invested a dime in. And so, we're not doing anything radical or dramatic on that, but you saw us clarify our core purpose as a company which is foundational to any company's brand at the company level. You saw us launch a new brand identity at Knowledge. We were very privileged and blessed to have \u2013 be named the World's Most Innovative Company by Forbes, which has given us great brand awareness as a starting point, and we'll continue to make thoughtful and selective investments in company brand, which is critical, not even so much for our business, but for the ability to attract and retain good people, and raising some awareness in the C-suite. So the investments we're making, I'll remind you, we're still being accretive with margin. Our margins are still significantly above what our peers' are in the industry. But we want to make sure \u2013 my concern is that we \u2013 we have more of a risk of underinvesting in this opportunity than overinvesting. So we'll do it thoughtfully, we'll do it transparently, and the goal is to set us up to take full advantage of the opportunity in front of us. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, I will echo what John said, Keith. And I'll also add to that, as we evolve as a company, we are shifting away from equity to more cash, which will have an impact we expect in future years on our operating margin, which is something that investors have asked us to do. Also, as we roll out new products, we anticipate there will be new products that come out, that are not \u2013 the buyers are different and we expect that will cost us a little more too, and that's factored into our margin forecast and we talked about at the Financial Analyst Day. And as John mentioned, I want to say, at the scale we are growing at, there's not too many companies that are showing the margin expansion we continue to show every year. And we will still remain very disciplined around free cash flow as well. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Many thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, guys; and a nice quarter. Maybe following along on sort of the deadline on investment, looking at this quarter, you guys had a really good hiring quarter. Typically you guys have your biggest hiring quarter in Q1; it looks like Q2 is actually a little bit ahead of that. How should we think about that in terms of, one, cadence of hiring for the rest of the year? Did you guys just \u2013 were you able to pull forward a lot of hiring, and two, maybe if you could give us some color in terms of like, what you're able to get done this quarter with that big hiring quarter in terms of who you got in place and sort of what areas you were able to get that investment into? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: What I would say, Keith, is first of all, I think, a lot of this is the results of the investments we started making in 2017 into our HR organization. And we are able to attract and retain people. And we will continue doing that based upon the opportunity that we saw from our success at the beginning of the year. We've actually upped our hiring targets internally here with some pretty aggressive hiring targets as we're starting to invest for 2019 and beyond. I think, it's too early to talk about necessarily the results of those head count coming in, because it takes time to get people to being productive, whether you're engineers or salespeople. So, I think that will show up in 2019. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And I'd just add, Keith, that one of the things we're doing is, we're kind of building out the team that you need to compete on not just the path to $4 billion, but the path from $4 billion to $10 billion. So for instance, user experience, as you know, you've heard me, you've heard CJ talk about the importance of user experience, important to mobile. Well, a year ago, we had 25, 30, maybe 40 user experience people. Now, we've 100, and we've hired really strong people. We took advantage of getting a group. We made one acquisition, and in Q2, we found a group of user experience professionals who were available and we moved on it. I mentioned earlier NowX. NowX went from being one guy at the beginning of the year to where it's now 25 engineers, and they're budgeted to go up to 50 engineers going forward. Again, that's 50 engineers working on products in the future, not on this year's roadmap. Our communications and brand function, again, a function that didn't exist a year ago, I think Alan Marks, our Chief Brand Officer, is up to a whopping empire of maybe 15 people. But we're building out functions thoughtfully. And these are the functions that we're going to need to grow into the future. And so, part of that head count growth is just coming from us. Geographic would be another one, our teams in Germany, our teams in Japan, our teams in markets that have huge upside. We want to make sure that we're, again, capitalizing on the opportunity we have, and getting the right leaders and the right teams in place. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you. Operator : Thank you. The next question... Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just to be clear \u2013 I'm sorry. I was just saying, just to be clear, like the 475 quarter-on-quarter increase, is that at all sort of pulling forward from the back-half of the year hiring, or is this kind of a new pace of hiring? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: It's a new pace of hiring. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And I can't stress enough too, it's also retaining people. Our attrition is at one of the lowest levels ever right now. People like working here. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Really great quarter. Congrats as well from me. I wanted to ask a question about AI and machine learning, where you've acquired and developed some fantastic capabilities. And we hear a lot of enthusiasm for these features in Kingston and more to come in London. But from the partners we speak with, it sounds like the demand is there, but that most customers aren't mature enough to be able to utilize those features. How are you thinking about the adoption curve and readiness for these types of capabilities, and what you see customers are ready for? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Brad, for that question. That gets at some of the things I was talking about in my Knowledge keynote. And I'd highlight two issues, and it's around, I'm going to call it, quality. Customers, to take advantage of the latest features, need to be on the latest version, right? And we have \u2013 one of the historical strengths of ServiceNow is allowing a little bit of flexibility, multi-instance, right, that we don't mandate being on the latest instance every six months. So, as a result, we have a variety of customers who are on some older instances and for whom upgrades take time. And so, we are working very hard, CJ designed his team, our engineering teams to do a couple of things. One, to make upgrades faster and easier so that people will upgrade more frequently and get closer to our latest instance, our latest version in each case. Two, I talked at Knowledge about best practices. And because the two ways to take full advantage of our machine learning capabilities that are coming out and improving every release is to be on a current version and have a best practice implementation, which means you've got a robust CMDB, you've implemented in a way that you can take advantage of the full data capabilities. And what's fascinating is, our most recent customers or customers that have re-implemented most recently are getting very fast upgrades, getting full benefits from our platform. So, one of the efforts that's sort of embedded in this customer success effort is ensuring we're getting all of our long-term customers on current versions implemented in a healthy, best practice manner. And that is going to enable them to take advantage of the innovation cycle that we're driving every six months. And next cycle, you're going to see a lot of great mobile stuff coming out, and you're going see customers who may be two versions back, wanting to get the latest version to take advantage of the native mobile capabilities we have. So, it's an important really sub effort under the guise of customer success to get people to the best practice and current contemporary integrations. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Fantastic, John. Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Operator, could you take the next question? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Questions on ITOM, it does feel like this quarter is a bit of an inflection, at least in large deals around ITOM. Not sure if CJ is on the call there, but I'm wondering was there sort of new pocket of budget you think you got access to with the recent ITOM release? Or anything in terms of value proposition you're able to satisfy for customers that you weren't before that's leading to that ITOM inflection? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I will say one of the things about ITOM is, with our latest release, especially with ServiceWatch, the mapping is a lot simpler, and it's a lot easier to deploy. And so, our salespeople, I think, in the quarter, you're seeing that they've been a lot more effective and comfortable in selling that in the right use cases to customers in the quarter. I would say, that's probably one of the bigger drivers for the success in ITOM. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And CJ is not on in the room. So... Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: But to be clear too, most of our ITOM deals were the ITOM suite, which includes Discovery, and Orchestration and ServiceWatch and Event Management in there. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And I think, there's a bit of an awareness thing going on too. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: That as we become more and more on the CIO's radar screen and agenda, and the CIO is thinking about not just ITSM, but how to \u2013 I've heard one CIO say, I want to run IT like a business, I've heard a hundred say it. And our ITOM suite helps them run it as a business. And so, that combined with digital transformation, where if they're running IT as a business, then they need to be focusing on how they drive cross-functional enablement. I think, the visibility of our ITOM capabilities is just getting higher. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Next question, operator? Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, John and Mike, good evening. John, a question for you about the long-term M&A strategy. Historically, you guys have made largely tuck-in acquisitions, and then been very patient in taking a year or so to integrate them with the existing platform. If I understand it correctly, I think you talked about that changing slightly when you go from $4 billion to $10 billion, where there might be adjacent separate platforms that would be acquired, and that strategy might change a bit. I'm wondering if you could drill down on it a little for us. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, Michael, it's \u2013 I'll just repeat what I said at our Investor Day, because it's \u2013 job one, two and three in the short to medium-term is to execute on the organic growth opportunities that we have, which are significant. And if a tuck-in acquisition can accelerate that progress by bringing us technology that we won't have to build ourselves or bringing us a talented team that allows us to move more quickly, then we're going to move on those. And one of the real strengths of the company historically is having this one platform, which is one of the reasons we've become that connective tissue. It's one of the reasons they call us the, platform of platforms, because by having \u2013 reintegrating them, reimplementing them on our platform, recoding them, if you will into our platform, allows our platform \u2013 allows all applications and all customers to take advantage of those, and allows our platform to be more extensible, the ability to move more quickly, build quickly on top of it; that's a real strength. So we're going to continue that focus, and that's our core focus for 95% of our organization. What I said at our Investor Day is, as you would want, Mike, and I, and our senior team and the board, we're beginning to say, all right, let's look out beyond just 18, 24, 36 months, and begin to say, what are the kinds of things that we need to be looking at considering and evaluating on our path to $10 billion? We believe and we hope and we expect that path will largely be organic. It has to be on the foundation of strong organic growth, but companies of that size, and given the market opportunity, and the impact that cloud and SaaS is having on the enterprise, selective M&A of a slightly larger size will most likely be part of that. So we're just now beginning to look at that, and planning. And so, I think over \u2013 I don't know, what 12 to 36, 48 month time horizon, you'll begin to see us be \u2013 if we see an opportunity where we think we can acquire an adjacent technology, an adjacent platform, something that will accelerate our growth down the road, we won't be hesitant to make those moves. But we want to do things in a way that does not distract our team from the core execution, that's immediately in front of us. And so, I think that's nothing imminent, but we're beginning to take a look forward. And when we find something, we'll let you know. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Anything you'd add Mike? I mean, I think, I'm pretty straight forward. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: No. I think, we're going to continue to be disciplined. It's not a must that it has to be written on our platform, but that has been our choice because of the ease at which we've been able to do it. Obviously, a larger acquisition that has a large installed base of customers, it will be more challenging and disruptive to try to reimplement it. So we'll see what happens. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, John. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. There's a lot to like in this quarter, but one of the things that jumped out to me looking at some of the products that seemed to have particularly strong uptake this quarter relative to past quarters was the SecOps product. And we \u2013 in our chats, we've been hearing more and more about it. So I'm just curious if there was anything notable to call out there in terms of momentum for that product specifically? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I think one of the things that, again that I'm most pleased about, and our team is most pleased about, that's less about this last quarter, but it's more about the future is just GRC being named as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. And GRC is in our Security Operations suite. And so, I've been hearing \u2013 as increased compliance requirements, increased cyber, just the whole area of GRC is one that's increasingly on board agendas, therefore on CEO, CFO and CIO agendas. And so, that product, I think has enormous opportunity, enormous upside, and we had some nice wins during the quarter on that front. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Correct. About 24% of our Security is GRC that we're doing. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And just one real quick housekeeping question for Mike. I know that the G2K metric is getting less focus these days, but it looks like some of the historical numbers around there moved around quite a bit. I know you recut that from time-to-time as the G2K list changes. Is that what happened this quarter or is there something else that we should be reading? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. No, in Q2 the list of Global 2000 companies gets rebalanced. You see a lot of movement in kind of the bottom quartile of G2K. I think, there were 60 something in the G2K itself of our customers that came out, then there were some others that came in. So we recast the prior periods as well, too, to show that like what we've done in other years, and net-net we added 21 G2K in the quarter. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: One thing, Jennifer, that's not \u2013 it's not directly G2K, but one of the nice things that is absolutely happening is the global nature of our company. And so, almost half of our deals greater than $1 million in the quarter were outside the U.S., in Europe and in Asia. I just want to give a recognition to our European teams, and our Asian teams. Asia in particular had just an outstanding quarter. And they're adding, global Japanese multinationals, global Australian multinationals. In Europe, we have many of the top brand names in Europe are customers that are continuing to expand. And so, the global nature of our platform is really kicking into place. And I would highlight; Germany and Japan is two markets we're still relatively early in cloud adoption, and they're enormous markets. And so as you see cloud adoption, Japan is a little ahead of Germany. As they grow, we view it as an opportunity, and we're going to try and make sure we invest appropriately to take advantage of that opportunity. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. I want to specifically ask about the CSM, the Customer Service Management opportunity, because when I look at the top 20 deals, it was included in quite a few of your top 20 deals compared to the Q1 top 20 deals. I was just hoping you could expand a little bit on what's going on with CSM, how it's performing, commercial versus enterprise, and maybe domestically versus internationally, and any change in the competitive dynamics with the CSM. Thanks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah. If you look at last quarter, Greg, we had a strong international quarter for CSM. If you look at our top deals, a number of them were in Europe, as well there's some in APJ. What I would say is, the CSM product is the one product that excites our commercial sales organization the most, because you can tend to do bigger CSM deals than you can do in HR or IT, just given the size of those organizations. But CSM is applicable across our entire customer base globally. And we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And Greg, I think it's \u2013 just adding to what Mike said, it's \u2013 and I've said this in previous calls, the thing that makes our CSM product unique, and therefore the types of circumstances and situations where it really applies is where a customer needs a platform that is not just a CS, not just a Customer Service platform. They want the same platform driving Customer Services as is driving IT, as is driving other cross-functional departments. Because what they really want to do is, take the inbound contacts coming into the Customer Service area, and get to the root cause, right, which is often cross-functional. They want a cross-functional platform so the customer support agent doesn't have to turn into a separate action, that they can get to the root cause, fix the root cause so that, that problem doesn't happen again. And they want to use as much self-help as possible. And our platform is very well-geared to those things. And so, smaller companies tend to want that, because they track it more closely, they aren't as big and as sprawling. And companies in certain industries, services industries, telecom industries, financial services that want to maximize the self-help that they're having their customers do, they want to get to the root cause and address them so that they actually reduce the need for inbound contacts, they're finding the fact that ServiceNow is a cross-functional platform to be one of the real advantages. So, it's not for the entire customer service market, but for that segment of the market, which is a non-trivial segment, we've got a very \u2013 I think, a very competitive and relevant product. Greg R. McDowell - JMP Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about one metric that looked like it jumped up, and that's renewal contract durations ticked up from 26 to 29 months, which is the longest we've seen. And then, if I also look at the same time at your 2010 cohort, the new ACV \u2013 or the ACV from that cohort's ticked up meaningfully to 105%. So I guess, can you talk about the \u2013 what's happening on renewals with renewal activity? What products are really resonating with those long-time customers, and if also this duration is a new normal or if that was just a blip? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would say, I think that was a little bit abnormal. There were a few very large customers that skewed that. And it's not driven by any particular product. ITSM and ITOM is very big, obviously, because remember most of the renewals that are coming in are from customers that bought three years ago. Most of our HR, SecOps and Security customers are less than three years old. I will say, part of it is one of our largest customers, who signed a 55-month renewal that kind of skewed that. So, I wouldn't expect it to be that high going forward. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe if I could squeeze one more in, I think, Mike, last quarter you mentioned an outperformance against internal plan. I was curious if you could comment on performance versus plan this quarter? I mean, how does the pipeline look? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: We had a very strong quarter, and our pipeline looks very good for the second half of the year. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Which is why we raised guidance. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Correct. Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : As you go towards the end, all those smart questions have been taken, you've got to think really hard about some good questions. Well, I have no questions. I'm kidding, of course, I have a question. All the good questions have been asked, but I'm curious, when you look at the ITOM business, it clearly saw an inflection point this quarter. Who are you replacing? Is this the beginning of a nice replacement cycle, like ITSM has been? And if you'll permit me, a sub-question there, how much more opportunity is left ahead in ITSM, granted that the company's future is going be hinged on your emerging products, platform products, et cetera? Just curious, thoughts on these two core products. Thank you. Congratulations, again. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So I'll start, Kash, with ITSM first. We only have about 4,500 enterprise customers. There's over 22,000 potential customers in the world. And every one of those will need an ITSM product. In many of our Global 2000 customers in large enterprises, we've only cracked into a country or a division. There's still a huge opportunity for ITSM within those customers. So, we truly believe we are still very much in the first half of the ballgame here with ITSM. And you'll see that ITSM actually had a very nice growth rate year-over-year. We are very pleased with that. And in terms of ITOM, generally, with ITOM, we are replacing legacy vendors. However, one of our products, ServiceWatch, which is the big piece of our ITOM suite, is solving a problem that no one else had ever been able to solve before. So, that is really more greenfield opportunity to solve a real business problem to be able to map the business service back to the IT asset so that when there's an outage, you know exactly what asset is causing that outage. So, that results in less downtime to the business service. That's what we're solving and what is resonating with customers there. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And just building on that, Kash, one of the things that Mike talked about at Investor Day, that I think is fueling some of the cloud software growth is, what was it, Mike? 30% of our new business is using software where software was not being used before. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Correct. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: And you think about all the inefficiency in an enterprise, all the manual workflows, all the places you're using spreadsheets and e-mail and other inefficient tools, where software, properly applied, can drive increased automation, increased productivity, increased efficiency, better user experience, that's I think one of the real opportunities. And to be honest, secret successes of ServiceNow is that ability to apply software in places software's not been applied before. So, it's not about replacing a legacy vendor. It's about extending software and extending our platform into new use cases. And so... Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's great. Thanks, John and Mike. I'm curious, Mike when you said the 5th innings, are we implying that from a user count perspective, ITSM is sort of 50%, although from a number of customers' perspective, it's only 20% penetrated. From a user count perspective, it's close to 40%, 50% or maybe that's quite overestimated? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I think it's still less than that. It varies by customer. But there's still a lot of opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base with ITSM. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And new customers like one big bank which has not chosen you guys for ITSM, right? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I know your bank has not chosen us. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yet, yet. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you so much guys. Congratulations. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Okay. And as a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating on today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. . As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is John Donahoe, our President and Chief Executive Officer. During today's call, we will review our third quarter financial results, and discuss our financial guidance for full-year 2018. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues and revenue growth. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. We may make forward-looking statements on this conference call, such as those using the words may, will, expects, believes or similar phrases to convey that information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. We had a strong third quarter continuing our global momentum and accelerating our role as a strategic partner enabling digital transformation. Our teams continue to execute well and our focus and commitment to customer success is evident in our results. We closed 25 deals in the third quarter with ACV greater than $1 million and we now have 614 customers doing more than $1 million in business with us. 11 customers are doing more than $10 million, almost triple the prior year, including four U.S. federal agencies. And we ended the quarter with more than 5,000 enterprise customers. The U.S. federal government represented our biggest deals in the quarter, accounting for a fifth of our total net-new ACV. This was our largest federal quarter ever. For example, the U.S. State Department is now our largest platform customer. We're becoming a critical strategic partner to the U.S. federal government as it modernizes its IT infrastructure and moves to cloud-based services and platforms. And further strengthening our public sector capabilities, we just announced an alliance with Microsoft to deliver digital workflows through the Azure Government Cloud. This alliance is designed to help federal agencies move faster and securely to cloud-based solutions. Just as we've seen in the private sector worldwide, digital transformation is becoming a public sector imperative and we are deeply committed to being a preferred strategic partner helping governments modernize, drive efficiency and deliver better experiences for employees and their citizens. I spent much of my time in Q3 traveling the world and meeting with our customers in Australia, Japan, France, Sweden, the UK and all across the U.S. In every discussion with CIOs and CEOs, a few common themes emerge, most importantly the business imperative for digital transformation, the need for trusted technology partners and the challenges of driving cultural change. And in more and more conversations we are being seen as a strategic partner of choice. Our core focus is on delivering digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock productivity. We make work, work better for people and our powerful platform and diverse product portfolios give us great opportunities. We're well positioned to play a broader strategic role in digital transformation journeys as our customers embrace this part of their future. Product innovation is essential to our success and continues to be a top priority. Our London release went live in the quarter, delivering customers exciting new product capabilities such as Virtual Agent that we announced earlier this year at Knowledge. Our London release demonstrates our ongoing commitment to delivering innovative, intelligent capabilities across our Now Platform and product portfolio. And looking ahead, we're investing heavily in more intuitive consumer-like user experiences and building more mobile-friendly, mobile-first capabilities. We expect to be launching significant enhancements in our mobile capabilities and user experience over the coming year. Customer success is also a big priority for us and we continue to make good progress. We're driving customer success to be a natural extension of our sales motion and are committed to both landing new customers and expanding our existing customer relationships in a healthy and sustainable manner. And our customer success approach is paying dividends. For example, our customer success team helped land a significant deal with a European Fortune 200 financial institution in the third quarter. This team showed how we can help enable and deliver key elements of their transformation initiatives and drive successful business outcomes. And we continue to focus on supporting a strong partner ecosystem. For example, Accenture just announced deeper investments with us in Europe to give their European customers a full range of implementation services and expertise in ServiceNow. And following on the heels of our recognition in May, as Forbes' number one World's Most Innovative Company, it was equally gratifying to be recognized this month as a top three company on Fortune's Future 50 list. The Future 50 identifies companies that are \"firmly focused on the long term.\" And that's us. In addition, Forrester recognized us as a leader in Enterprise Service Management and Gartner named us as a leader in their Magic Quadrant IT Service Management Tools for the fifth consecutive year, citing our completeness of vision and ability to execute. In closing, I'm very pleased with our strong quarter. We have strong momentum and we're continuing to make progress against our strategic priorities. At the end of the day, digital transformation is about delivering great experiences and unlocking productivity and our digital workflows enable both. With our Now Platform in our three workflow clouds; IT, employee experience, and customer service, our customers can create intelligent and intuitive experiences to make work, work better for people; and that in turn unlocks productivity, both for the employees who can now focus on higher value-added work and for the entire enterprise by making work simpler, easy and faster. That is the future of work and we're committed to helping our customers create it. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you, John. Our first half momentum continued into Q3 and we delivered another quarter of strong performance setting us up for a great finish to 2018. Subscription revenues were $627 million, representing year-over-year growth of 39% and constant-currency growth of 40%; and subscription billings were $674 million, representing year-over-year growth of 35% and constant currency and duration growth of 34%. Our strong top-line performance was driven by bookings outperformance coupled with accelerated revenue recognition from self-posted deals. Our U.S. federal business highlighted the quarter. Government agencies are increasingly looking for strategic partners to help them digitally transform their businesses. While IT is a key driver of this initiative, we're also seeing federal customers look to our emerging products including our platform offering, which drove our largest deal in the quarter. Our investments in our federal sales force and FedRAMP-certified data centers are paying off and we view this sector as a large opportunity going forward. In Q3, the U.S. federal sector represented 20% of net-new ACV, up from 18% in the prior year. We also saw strong profitability in Q3, including 24% operating margin and 17% free cash flow margin, driven by some marketing expense that shift into Q4 back-end higher linearity and lower-than-expected professional services partner fees. Due to the strong performance through the first three quarters of the year and expectations going into Q4, we are raising revenue billings and free cash flow guidance in 2018. We now expect subscription revenues between $2.415 billion and $2.42 billion, representing 39% year-over-year growth and 37% constant-currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $2.83 billion and $2.835 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth and 31% to 32% constant currency and duration growth. We are maintaining 2018 subscription gross margins of 85% and operating margin of 20%. We continue to see strong productivity from our sales force and we will continue to hire aggressively after adding a record 500-plus net-new employees in Q3. We are increasing our 2018 free cash flow margin guidance to 28%. Finally, we expect 188 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year. With that operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great and thanks for taking my question. Well, let me drill down a little bit more into the success you've seen overall in the federal markets and kind of the breadth of the portfolio, which I think you touched on a little bit. But is the take typically around ITSM and then further add-ons, number one. And number two, is this more of a greenfield opportunity you're seeing within fed or a brownfield opportunity at this point? Would love to get some color? Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Sure, Rob. I'll tell you the \u2013 in my travels over the last year, I've met with governments now in all three continents, multiple countries, federal, state and local. And a couple of things are clear. I think initially when cloud came around, governments were a little bit suspicious and may be a little bit slow to embrace it for security concerns, for the newness factor. I will tell you that's changing, and governments are under pressure to deliver efficiency and deliver better citizen experiences, and they now recognize cloud and to do that in a safe and secure way and they now recognize cloud is an important enabler of that. So we are seeing strong demand from governments. Again federal, state and local really around the world. Now in the U.S. federal sector, the good news is ServiceNow has been investing in this sector and in this team over the last several years. We have a dedicated sales team in Washington with a lot of resident expertise there. And the demands \u2013 I was in Washington for a full week, it's probably into Q2, early Q3 literally across multiple federal agencies. They're looking for their own equivalent of digital transformation and they view our platform. What's fascinating is they perhaps even more than the commercial sector start with our platform and the power of the platform. And so the State Department deal that we talked about in the script was fundamentally a platform deal and then ITSM and other products on top of it. One of the military services is using our platform in some very creative ways to look at how they onboard their soldiers, how they move their soldiers around, how they off-board over time. And so we're very excited about the opportunity with both the U.S. federal government and governments more generally. Because obviously they have big budgets, they have big needs, are under pressure to deliver and they're turning out to be some of our more innovative customers on how aggressively they're embracing the platform. One final story. You can certainly hear my excitement on this. In Australia, and same thing here in the UK, some of the State and regional governments are using our platform for some really creative ways. For instance, one of the port authorities that also oversees a bust \u2013 the busting system is talking about how they're delivering better end-to-end experiences both for the packages and for the people using the ServiceNow Platform. So again, I think there's enormous opportunity here. And obviously the reason federal so big in Q3 is the U.S. federal budget cycle ends at the end of September 30. So this is obviously their equivalent of what commercial business will be in Q4. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. First, I just had a question for Mike. If I look at the outperformance that you had in Q3 sort of normalizing for duration and currency, it looks like from the slide deck, it was about $21 million of outperformance relative to the midpoint of guidance. Certainly, you're taking the full-year numbers higher for non-GAAP subscription billings, but maybe by a little less than the outperformance you saw in Q3. Is there any sort of \u2013 did you see things that you thought would be in Q4 pulled forward? I'm just trying to contextualize what looks like sort of implicit guide down for Q4 relative to what sounds like pretty bullish commentary on the environment. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. No, well, we actually raised Q4 when you look at what we did $8 million for billings was deals that we're expecting in Q3 that happened in Q4 \u2013 or sorry we expected in Q4 that were pulled into Q3. And then you also see on the revenue side as well too there was about $4 million of the beat in Q3 was associated with Q4 deals that were self-hosted that happened in Q3. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And you can see that by the way in our IR deck. We did a reconciliation on page four. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And maybe just a bigger picture question. I think you and others have had a pretty phenomenal calendar 2018 and we're not at the point yet to get calendar 2019 guidance. But I guess sort of two questions. One there was a question earlier in the year whether tax reform would create sort of a high \u2013 better-than-normal spending environment, now that we're sort of closing out the year, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on whether that \u2013 how much of an impact is maybe you thought that it would? And two, as you talk about these digital transformation projects with customers, what's sort of the time duration attached to those? Are people talking to you about multi-year deals that would carry over into future years? Or is it sort of tactical around tax reform in 2018 that maybe fueled a little more than normal activity? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. I'll start Jennifer. I don't think we've really seen any big impact to tax reform. I'm not hearing customers spending more specifically on ServiceNow due to tax reform. I definitely don't think it's hurt us, but I would say we weren't expecting a big uptick as a result of that. And I'll let John talk about more the length of a digital transformation with customers. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, Jennifer the thing that's striking to me and I'd say this has evolved even in the 18 months I've been here. Digital transformation is no longer a business buzzword. Digital transformation is an essential strategic need for virtually every customer that I'm meeting with and it is just stunning the consistency around that. And in simple terms you think about it's software that's disrupting every company and every industry and every geography. Every company wants to digitally connect with their customers. They want to provide a better digital experience to their employees and they want to use digital technology to drive productivity and efficiency so they can dedicate \u2013 their talent their capital to scarce resources to innovating for their customers and not getting consumed in the global \u2013 the complexity of running a global enterprise. So I hear that literally in every interaction. Actually, it's commercial and governments. And so digital transformation absolutely is at the top of the investment priorities of companies and I don't think it's driven by tax reform or even macroeconomic factors. I think it's more strategic spend. And so we feel ourselves in the middle of that strategic spend where \u2013 I'll give an example. I was at a large Fortune 50 consumer products company where they've identified and growth in consumer products companies are not huge. So productivities become very, very important. And they've identified \u2013 they said, we've done the easy cost reduction. We've done the easy now. We need to drive productivity, healthy productivity. And this is the head of their shared services, their business shared services group which is a highly empowered group across their divisions. And he said, automating workflows \u2013 we view streamlining, simplifying, and automating workflows across our large global entity, we view is the source of highly positive, highly healthy productivity that includes employee experience and helps reduce costs. And he said, we've looked around and we view ServiceNow as a core strategic partner and core strategic platform in helping us do that. And so what I find encouraging \u2013 so yes, is it multiyear? It's absolutely multiyear. So increasingly we're getting pulled into the strategic initiatives of companies and tied to real business outcomes, economic outcomes around employee experience and around productivity. So I think that's what's fueling our demand. Obviously, cloud is a phenomenon. We're still early in the cloud world I believe. And cloud is one of the few investments you can make that can provide better experiences, faster speed and lower cost. And that's really driving the demand. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I would add too Jennifer. The one thing that we have seen I remember from five, six years ago, a lot of the analysts used to say that the role of the CIO was going to be diminished because of cloud. If anything we see with the digital transformation, the CIOs are becoming more strategic in their companies and it helps that we have a relationship with the CIOs. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Absolutely. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks very much and congrats on a nice quarter. John, I was kind of curious just you mentioned sort of the three workflow clouds I think and in terms of IT employee onboarding and Customer Service Management. I was just curious, are you guys doing anything around the go-to market to try to take those kind of concepts into the market more directly? Or are there things that you are thinking about? You may have mentioned that before but that's the first time I've heard you talk about them in those three buckets. And then Mike, I was just wondering if you could just touch upon about well a big hiring quarter for you guys, where you're adding people may be? And where are you focused on with these hires for next year? Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. Great question, Kirk. And to be honest it's sort of funny. Mike and I are sitting in the room right now where we did our end-of-summer product reviews and looking about our strategy. And I had just come back from a month on the road meeting with customers, CJ Desai just come out of all of his product reviews. And what we sort of realized that we've been describing our product portfolio in what I would describe as inside-out terms, HR, security, customer support ITOM, ITSM. And the reality is those aren't the words the customers are using. And so this move to the three \u2013 or the Now Platform and three clouds is to some extent adopting the same language the customers are using when they think about it. So let me just sort of describe each. Customers almost inevitably talk about our platform first not our products. They say your platform is powerful. We recognize the power and value of your platform both your out-of-the-box and our ability to build applications on it. And it's becoming one of the core platforms, one of our core \u2013 if I've heard this once I've heard it 25 times in the last 60, 90 days. You're now one of our core strategic platforms going forward. So, the Now Platform is the sort of foundational element. And then the three clouds are really describing our products, our existing products around the business areas that they're addressing. So our IT work, we call it three workflow clouds. Our IT workflow cloud is helping the IT run their business, run IT as a business. So that's IT Service Management ITOM, that's IT Analytics Management, IT Business Management. And so the CIO are increasingly looking at our capabilities to help them run their own function better. The employee workflow clouds or the employee experience cloud is how they're describing their desire to automate workflows to deliver better end-to-end employee experiences and drive better efficiency. And so that's where ITSM HR Case Management, HR Onboarding and Offboarding those all tie together to help build end-to-end employee experiences. And they're asking us around facilities and finance and other functions that can we automate workflows. And so you'll see us our product development and NowX focus will be on building out some of those workflows to deliver the end-to-end experiences and help them drive greater productivity across that. And then the last cloud the customer support, the customer service workflow cloud is really driven by a subset of customers. Frankly, more of B2B customers who are increasingly using our capabilities to serve their customers and I think about the whole customer support market or customer service market as two broad segments. One a B2C segment where customer service platforms seem to be more CRM-based that's not our sweet spot. But B2B environments where the inbound customer contacts need to get to the root cause of what's causing the problem get that root cause addressed, and then getting back to the customer with resolution. Our platform is very well suited to that and that's really when you look at our growth in customer support where it's driving. So these, I think, three grouping in these three areas I was at the major CIO organization a couple of weeks ago. I think allow us to more crystally describe who we are? We are the digital workflow company and help drive our incremental innovation investment and link it to their business outcomes, link it to the goals that they've established for themselves. I think they'll see us drive a little more of our marketing and how we talk about the company in these terms. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And then Kirk, on your question with regards to the head count where are we putting these people. Most of these people the #1 is R&D. Number two is our sales organization and that kind of flows through the rest into the others. And we think that R&D and sales will be the big investment areas as well and actually in our next three years is when we're planning on hiring most of our people in those two groups as we see the opportunity in front of us. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, Thank you so much for taking my question. I just wanted to get your thoughts very quickly. Do you see any tailwinds or headwinds through IT spending in 2019 based on John your conversations with customers? And secondly, when I look at the way you categorize your clouds you've got to play in HCM. Broadly, being understood as HCM you've got to play in the CRM market. Also I cannot help it wonder, but as you look at your plans to be a $5 billion, $10 billion revenue company, it appears to me that there could be other major markets that you have to participate in a pretty big way. Because you know, obviously, company like salesforce.com worked and have made some significant acquisitions along the way on route to trying to be large company. So I just wonder how do you think about the acquisition roadmap and your potential of playing in markets in a much bigger way that you have to, if you were to become a multiple of your current size? And it's meant to be worded in the constructive way rather than a critical way? Thank you so much. Appreciate it. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, Kash, let me \u2013 on IT spend as I said earlier to be honest it's digital transformation investment that every company is needing to make. They're embracing software, they're embracing cloud and that's therefore driving IT spend. So we see continued strength there. I appreciate your question because I think it's a really important one. And again, I'm going to answer this through the eyes of the customers about what I hear consistently and how we understand where we play. What I consistently hear from CIOs, COOs and in some cases CEOs is as they embrace cloud at the infrastructure level they're consolidating their infrastructure needs and they are figuring out what their public cloud, hybrid cloud, private cloud strategies are. And then at the software layer they're adopting four to six strategic cloud platforms. And typically those would be often it's a Salesforce for their sales cloud and sometimes their marketing cloud, Adobe for their marketing cloud. A Workday for their employee or HCM cloud, Office 365 or Microsoft often for their productivity, albeit on the supply chain you'll hear SAP frequently. And ServiceNow is both the IT cloud, but also the workflow cloud. The cloud that helps enable the workflow all around these other systems on record. And they say two things. One, they want one plus one plus one plus one to equal 10. So it is not a zero-sum game in their minds. They view each of these core strategic platform as additive and they want us to work effectively together, which I believe that we can do and are doing. And two, our particular role is not just IT, it's workflow. And so we view our market opportunity is digitizing and automating workflows all across the enterprise. So we will never be an HCM system of record. We don't need to be and we use Workday internally. We think they're terrific. We'll never be a CRM system of record. We think there's \u2013 we think Salesforce and Adobe and others do that quite well. We'll never be a financial system of record or a financial ERP. What we do, do better than anyone is the workflows around those platforms. And if we look at that opportunity that market opportunity we think it's an enormous TAM and offers tremendous growth opportunity to $10 billion and well beyond. So the point I just want to make is, I do not see this and nor do customers see this as a zero-sum game among the major strategic cloud platforms, they want them to work together. I believe there's plenty of growth for all of them. And in particular I think us is the digital workflow company. We have a huge market opportunity that's additive to the others and that's what we're pursuing. And to be honest, again, these three clouds everything I'm talking about has not been thought up here in some windowless conference room. It's based out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds \u2013 or conversations with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of customers. And that's what they're saying to us. I'll make one final comment, you can hear a little my passion on this. As I said I was fortunate enough to be able to speak to the top CIO group a couple of weeks ago. And a CIO of \u2013 again in this space different one but of a major industrial company, Fortune 25, Fortune 50 company said hey this is his algorithm. He called it, one plus, one plus, one plus one times ServiceNow equals 10 times. He talked about ideas and his text deck he has a Salesforce or Workday and Office 365 in his case an Oracle for financial ERP. And he said and we have ServiceNow that instead of being plus one is times one and the multiplicative impact we can have not just in IT but when workflow around all those other cloud gives the 10 times impact. And that's directionally is what we're hearing and that's directionally what we're pursuing. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very well put. Thank you so much, John. Thank you, Mike as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Alex, please check your mute button. Okay. Our next question is Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I liked my new name. Quick John, can I stay on that subject. And as you kind of move over to \u2013 and talk more about platform and be more the workflow platform, how do you \u2013 as you think about 2019 how do you think about your go-to-market with your sales guys in terms of how they are positioning it? What you do with your sales guys in terms of \u2013 are they able to kind of get that message across? What needs to change there to kind of do kind of even do a better job there? And then for Mike, you gave us some cash flow margin kind of framework at the Analyst Day, I see now you kind of upgraded that a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers for the upgrade this year and if that changes your overall framework? Thank you? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. Raimo on your first question I believe there's a lot of those to even focus the sales teams even more. So obviously, our platform and IT cloud is our historically sweet spot to CIOs. And as Mike mentioned, the CIOs increasingly playing a strategic role. Describing things as the Employee Experience Cloud or Employee Workflow Cloud is a better description I think of what we do because Employee Experience is not just an HR issue or just an IT issue or just a legal or just a finance. But increasingly, you're seeing as companies try to embrace the end-to-end employee experience and automate workflow. The CIO has to work with the CHRO who has to work with the CFO. And we often are sponsored introduced into that equation walked by the CIO, but we find ourselves working with that trio that team more frequently. And sometimes you have a shared services and a shared business services person that often report to the CFO. But it's, that triad as companies are trying to say, how do we digitize our internal processes and digitize our internal employee's experience? It needs the CIOs, CHRO and CFO work shared services. And so we're calling on that group. And then in the customer service or customer support world by being even sharper and clearer that B2B is our focus. In many cases customer service in a B2B environment reports either to the CFO or COO. And so again, that's an area that's a natural and the CIO is often involved so it's a more natural adjacency for us. And so I think if Dave Schneider or Kevin Haverty were here they'd say, this kind of way of thinking about and describing what we are, which is \u2013 it actually reflects what we're doing, mirrors what we're doing in a more focused way. And again, the CIO as Mike said earlier, is increasingly involved in almost all of those situations. So, it's our strength there is, I think, an asset. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: And then Raimo on cash flow, I thought you'd be happy that I was giving \u2013 or we're giving good cash flow margin increase per year free cash flow. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh, I am. I am. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: But it's driven by a couple of things this year. Part of it is Q4 is off to a very good start in terms of the billings associated with the number of customers that I expect collections to be very strong this quarter more than what I was thinking earlier on the year and it's really a timing issue. The other thing is there's a bunch of CapEx projects that we're initiating, because I don't think the payments is going to happen until next year. So that's really pushing some of our spending from a cash flow perspective into 2019. As a reminder at Financial Analyst Day, we did say we will get greater than 1% operating margin and greater than 0% free cash flow margin expansion. Not giving guidance for 2019 right now, but I do think operating margin and free cash flow will converge a little bit to growth and then longer term now, I just want to remind people cash taxes will kick in, in around 2023, 2024, which will have an impact on free cash flow. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, clear. Thank you. Congratulations Operator : Thank you. Our next question... John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Operator, next question. Operator : It comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Cash did a great job on going at a very high level, and John you answered it great. I wanted to drill downwards a little bit and ask you about two product areas. One in ITOM, how much do you think about going down the stack, down closer into monitoring and actually touching the infrastructure? And then one sub-segment that's been active in M&A and the industry lately has been around IT notification what seems to be, well there's been some acquisitions there. I was wondering if that is in your sweet spot and if you're investing here? So, down the stack towards monitoring and touching the IT infrastructure and IT notification? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Michael, again the way I'll answer that is we're listening intensely to the customer and listening intensely to how CIOs, how VPs of infrastructure, VPs of application envision running and leading IT over the next five to 10 years. Because there's just no doubt that the role of IT shifting in the company and the way they're running IT is shifting and growing. And so there's \u2013 we have very strong demand for ITOM this year and that can be discovery service mapping just as they are trying to get a robust CMDB. And I think there is some appetite for us to explore as you described moving down the stack. To have our platform continue to broaden and expand so that they have \u2013 I don't want to say one-stop shop, but they have \u2013 they can build more \u2013 have fewer applications and then more applications on our platform is the way I would say it. And so where \u2013 when you look at our roadmap, when you look at any M&A we may do, we're simply listening to our customers and saying how do we continue to build other ITOM and other IT capabilities to help ensure that CEO \u2013 I'm sorry CIOs can run IT in a modern way? That's \u2013 because they got this \u2013 they have this embargo (39:33) effect, where they have is a lot of his legacy stuff. And the legacy stuff is not going away overnight and yet they have modern platforms like ServiceNow and other modern applications and modern mindsets around agile and DevOps. And the CIOs want our platform to bridge \u2013 help them bridge both. And so they can't walk away from the legacy. We help them address that. But also we're increasingly helping them run IT in a modern way. And so that will continue to drive not only the organic growth \u2013 and organic roadmaps rather for IT-related products, but also our M&A agenda when we can add incremental capabilities to our company and our platform that match those needs that CIOs want. We'll continue to do that. And then IT notification, to be honest, I haven't really \u2013 that may be \u2013 I haven't heard that specific request, but \u2013 and CJ's not in the room with us. It very well could be on the roadmap, it's just not \u2013 do you know Mike ... Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes, there's a lot of people that play in that market there was \u2013 you've got \u2013 (40:45). You have Zendesk bought that (40:48) have VictorOps that was acquired. It's not something, there's a lot of players down there, Splunk is playing in that space we're going to more partner down there right now. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great guys. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is open. Vinay Mohan - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey guys, this is actually Vinay on for Justin. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. And continuing on the product theme, if you look at the HR services or Case Management market specifically just kind of wondering how do you see the pace of spending or deal sizes trending there, and how would you characterize the competitive environment? Thanks. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, the HR or what we have been describing as our HR product increasingly are considered a component of our employee experience. And it performed well. We've got 20 U.S. magnitude and we think it's something 20 customers over $1 million. And again, where we tend to get involved is when there's an employee experience initiative. And that's when you want to combine the many of the finance systems records, the HR, HCM system of record, things like payroll, P&E, and other things into a seamless experience for employees. And increasingly, companies are realizing that they want what I would have called a shared services portal. But they want to have their employees go one place where they can report problems, get knowledge get their questions answered and get things resolved. And if you have to go to a different place from an IT problem as you do an HR problem as you do a facilities problem, employees are going to pick up the phone. And that's what employees don't like that and increasingly organizations don't like that because it's high cost. And so our shared services portal both web and increasingly mobile allows companies to tell their employees go one place for all of your internal problems and questions and get them resolved and if you can use self-help that's what employees love that's far more productive and efficient for the company or an automated response through Knowledge. And so that's the pull, that's the underlying business pull we feel and that's the situations where our platform our workflow platform is relatively unique. So, that may start with HR Case Management, that may start with our Onboarding and Offboarding, it may start with shared services portal. We had a customer, a large top five U.K. bank, it's a global bank based on the U.K. and they went live with our an end-to-end employee experience that we were fueling. In this case alongside SuccessFactors with 173,000 employees and I think from start to finish they got it live in something like six months. It might have been a little more than six months. And so \u2013 and again that was a CEO COO-sponsored initiative that HR's partnering with IT partnering with finance to drive a strong end-to-end experience. And our platform is a cross functional workflow platform was sort of a foundational element and the fact that we worked well with all the other supporting platforms. It's really \u2013 and so that's what's driving our \u2013 that's why calling employee experience I think is a more accurate depiction and will also drive our incremental roadmap priorities. Vinay Mohan - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask about FriendlyData. It looks like it's bringing natural query language or natural language query to the platform. It seems like that could resonate well with some of your non-technical users. I think you guys mentioned that you're re-platforming it. Can you comment a bit about what this means to the platform? And maybe any feedback from customers when this acquisition was announced? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yeah, Matt. This is \u2013 this is I think it's now our fourth I'll call it AI-related acquisition starting with the DxContinuum. And look \u2013 here's what customers are saying. They're saying two things. One they want to build experiences that are really easy to use and really easy to build so low code, no code kind of capabilities for the developers inside the company. And they want to have experiences that their employees can get automated or self-help kind of functionality. And so what this particular acquisition does as you've said sort of language processing, just helps you translate, just helps you natural language search, it helps you translate voice or voice text would be my simple way of saying it. But with natural language and receive responses and charts or graphs or text. And so it's a form of chatbot, it's the way I think about it. But you make a request in one mode, whether that's voice or text or verbal and it responds in the mode you want back. And so it's a nice team, it's a good team of engineering talent and a good platform and we're doing what we do with every acquisition we make that they're recoding it into the core ServiceNow Platform, our menu of one core platform driving all of our applications and customers. And we think it accelerates our road map significantly. It will be used across all products and will help drive platform adoption. And we're thrilled to have the team, really, really, really strong team, nice team. And we're excited to have them part of our overall organization. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. You line is open. Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): Hi, thanks. A question I think for Mike or if Dave Schneider is in the room there. Wondering on the sales capacity build as we look at that headed into 2019. Could you maybe contrast or compare how that ramp and the composition of that ramp compared to what we've seen in the last couple of years? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: I expect it to be pretty similar in terms of what we're looking to add going into next year. I'm not expecting major changes to the sales organization next year. I will say most of our revenue as you know comes from large enterprise. As we've said before around 20%, 21% of our revenue is commercial and the other is G2K and large enterprise and public sector. And so obviously we're very focused on public sector and geographically, we think there's a large opportunity continue to grow in Asia with new logos, but there's lots of opportunities still within the U.S. and EMEA to further penetrate our existing accounts. And we still find that reps have too many accounts they're covering and we needed to hire more people. And so we're going to continue to run as well, we're going to continue to add more product sales specialists as well to support our emerging products within our sales organization. Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): And then on the product side relative to security. I'm wondering if you could update us on success there and your thoughts on it? You sort of fairly narrow player in that market if you have any ambitions in terms of expanding your addressable offerings in that area. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, I mean I'll take this. And Mike you can add on. So inside what we characterize as security are really currently three use cases. One is, GRC, which by the way there's a lot of demand for it. You'd call that security and not security it's often driven by the Audit Committee. And there's a growing focus on governance, risk and compliance. And I might even add privacy to that in this day-and-age. And so we think that product \u2013 we know that product is getting a lot of demand and increasingly audit committees, or CIOs are being brought \u2013 CIO and CFOs are being brought to audit committees and they wanted to have automated ways of monitoring all the various tools and all the various platforms and all the various products that go into governance, risk, and compliance across in enterprise and the ServiceNow Platform is a great way to get one source of truth for that. So that's driving that piece of the equation. And then we have incident response and vulnerability response. And it's a two core, use cases in our security suite. And we'd see \u2013 I'd say strong demand for both. And I view it consistent with your question, it's complementary to the many other security platforms and tools in that space. And so we may incrementally \u2013 I don't think it's going to be a major area of expansion for us simply because I think it's been well served by others. And it's a fairly fragmented space. It's a space that's changing rapidly. And so I think the workflows around security that's going to be our suite spot and that's in essence of what we do. That's why this workflow mindset, these workflow clouds will be \u2013 will help do workflow around security. But I don't think you'll see us become one of the core security platforms like the Palo Alto or Splunk or a FireEye or some of the others. Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question and great job on the quarter. So a quick question for both of you. I'll start with you Mike. Mike how are you thinking about the Professional Services segment going forward? Because we've heard from some of your SI partners about one of your biggest issues is really a high-class problem and it's essentially not enough ServiceNow experts out there in the field to meet the demand in our ServiceNow practices. So do you think about needing to reinvest in that business? And then a quick one for you also John, it seems to me that you guys are likely really starting to see some brand recognition for ServiceNow in the market. I imagine you have to be given some of the deals you're signing. Is there some kind of a strategic shift behind marketing to the enterprise that you're undertaking that you can share with us? Thank you both, appreciate it. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: So Sarah I'll start with Professional Services. That is absolutely true. We do hear from partners that they can't find enough trained people. And as a result when we started this over the last year, we hired a new head of training. We've been investing extremely heavily in training where we're trying to roll out a lot of free content for our partners and others. That's why you see that reflected in our Professional Service margin. We're training ourselves (52:20) in there. And in terms of \u2013 we do think our Professional Service organization is strategic, but we are there to support our partners doing implementation as well as our customers where they want us there. Our preference is for partners to be doing the implementations. We want our partners to be investing in their ServiceNow business because if they do that they're going to help sell ServiceNow. And we think that is the right thing to do and will continue that way. And John, I'll let you talk about brand. John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: Yes. I'll just to piggyback. So Sarah coincidently Mike mentioned, we hired Cat Lang who is just a fabulous leader of our training certification. She joined us about a year ago. She happens to have her team, her global team in town today and I was down with them this morning. And one of the things that we're actively engaging with the partners on is how do we work with them to turbocharge the number of certified resources, and so big effort to certify their existing employees. But whether it's in the Europe or the U.S. we're trying to work with Accenture, with the DXC, with the KPMG, with an IBM going to campus and training generations of ServiceNow-certified people that they then join these firms. And so I think we're \u2013 I hope 2019 is a year where we go from defense to offense on that, to help fill the void to have a large-enough pool of certified professionals. And then, thank you for the recognition on the company brand. Alan Marks, our Chief Communications Brand Officer has been sitting next to me. He was with me for 10 years at eBay and joined ServiceNow 18 months ago. And he's got a smile on his face because of your question. And he and our Chief Marketing Officer Dan Rogers are really working well together to try to raise our profile as a company in addition to our products. So products are well-known in IT. But we just haven't really ever focused on raising our awareness as a brand. And it helps to be named the most Innovative Company in the World by Forbes. It helps to be one of the Fortune's top three companies of the future. That's raising our visibility. But we're also \u2013 if you happen to live in San Francisco you may notice that we actually have a few billboards, a few wraparound buses. We're wrapping up our digital marketing a little bit. And so I think relatively early days, but it is an area that we feel like it's both appropriate. And the time is right to ramp-up our investment and brand. And again, the way we think about it is there is product brand and company brand. Product brand is geared to decision makers. And to be honest with IT we are well-known and increasingly with other parts. Company brand is more focused on recruits, employees and getting some C-suite awareness outside of IT. And so that's why we think it's an important and complementary area of investment. And we're still, I think Alan would say we've begun our path on that journey and we still have a long way to go. But we're excited about the brand and we're excited about the opportunity. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you very much. Very helpful. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Hey, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling, so just to dig deeper into the fed fraction that you saw in the quarter. If you were to rate which are the products that have been the \u2013 has seen highest adoption amongst the fed customers how would you rate them? Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Well, ITSM and ITOM, IT in general is still the predominant product that is in the federal government. With that we did mention platform is becoming increasingly more important. And I'd say the largest platform customer is now a government agency, but by and large IT and ITOM are still the bulk of what's in the federal government. We have seen some CSM as well and platform. Don't really think we've seen any and I'm looking at HR and have we seen any HR in the federal government? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: What we're thinking \u2013 I mean the use case I referred to earlier I don't know if they're using the specific HR expansion product or they're building their own application. Because this is a military service, because of the specific use cases. Similarly, this is not the U.S. federal government but ironically several airports use ServiceNow to help manage, again it's a municipal more local government or regional government. And the government that \u2013 they are using ServiceNow to help drive the airports, which include customers and employees. Sometimes it's with out-of-the-box applications and sometimes they're just frankly using the platform to configure to the specific use case of an airport. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Got you. That's helpful. And as follow-up, if I were to follow on the contract land that we saw in the quarter. I mean the new customer contact land and the upsell contract land actually shortened for the last two quarters. Anything that needs to be read into that? Or is it just a normal course of business? John J. Donahoe - ServiceNow, Inc.: It's a normal course of business. Q3 is a big federal quarter. Federal governments sign 1-year deal, lets excuse that. The other thing, in Q3 upsells is such a big piece of our business and the number of our customers co-term their contract at the end of the year and many are on a calendar year invoicing cycle for when their contract started because Q4 is such a big quarter. So that's just normal seasonality. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Awesome. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Michael Scarpelli for any closing remarks. Michael P. Scarpelli - ServiceNow, Inc.: Thank you. As a reminder a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investor section of our website. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the call over to John. John Donahoe : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. We finished 2018 with our strongest fourth quarter ever. Continuing our momentum is the leading digital workflow company shaping the future of work. Our role as a strategic partner to the world\u2019s largest enterprises continues to accelerate enabling their digital transformation by making work better for people. Our teams continue to execute well. And our continued focus and commitment to customer success shows in our strong results. Expanding our existing customer relationships will drive much of our growth going forward and we have ample opportunity. We are now helping to enable the digital transformation of almost 5,400 enterprise customers, including almost 75% of the Fortune 500. We now have 678 customers doing more than a $1 million in business annually with us, and we have 74 customers, who are doing greater than $5 million, up 54% year-over-year. And the number of customers doing greater than $10 million has more than tripled year-over-year to 18, including three above $20 million. Our renewal rate for the quarter was a strong 98%. Our formula is clear. When we land our platform in products with a new customer, we begin delivering great experiences and unlocking productivity. That in turn is what drives our expansion, and our focus is on building long-term strategic partnerships with our customers that enable their success. And I\u2019ll point out that we still represent a small percentage of IT spend for most of our customers that gives us tremendous opportunity to grow and deliver the business outcomes that our customers want and need. Strong performance across our portfolio and across every geography drove our momentum, led by accelerating year-over-year growth in EMEA. Our teams exceeded their plans for the fourth quarter and for the full year. All of our products perform well. Both our HR and customer service products for example, now have more than 20 customers doing more than a $1 million, and 19 of our top 20 deals in the quarter included three or more products. Even more important, net new business in our core IT workflow products reaccelerated in 2018. This underscores the strength of our flagship product, the strategic partners we\u2019re building with CIOs and the continued market opportunity to expand the impact of our core IT workflow products. We are very well positioned. In the fourth quarter, I had an opportunity to meet with 50 of the world\u2019s most respected CIOs. They reiterated common themes I\u2019ve shared with you before, and then I continue to hear in my customer conversations worldwide. The business imperative for digital transformation, the need for trusted technology partners, and the challenges of driving cultural change. These leading CIOs understand the power of our Now Platform and products. They view ServiceNow as a strategic partner. But as one CIO put it, he doesn\u2019t view us as just another cloud partner. He sees ServiceNow as the platform that creates a multiplier effect in his cloud ecosystem. Our enterprise capabilities link together other systems and platforms enabling seamless digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock productivity and that\u2019s what every C-suite executive I speak with is looking for. Ongoing product innovation is essential to enabling these business outcomes and continues to be a top priority for us. I feel very good about the progress our product organization is making and improving our user experience and user interface, creating simple intuitive mobile experiences and making our platform and products easier to deploy and upgrade. We\u2019re getting great feedback from beta testers and or upcoming Madrid release and we expect to be launching significant enhancements in our mobile capabilities and user experience later this year. I also feel very good about the progress driving customer success another top priority. We\u2019re driving customer success to be a natural extension of our sales motion and are committed to landing new customers and expanding new existing relationships in a healthy and sustainable manner. We\u2019re entering this year with strong alignment across our pre-sales and post-sales teams and we\u2019re driving a consistent approach to creating value for our customers and delivering their desired business outcomes. Leading this effort is David Schneider, who was recently promoted to be our President, Global Customer Operations. Dave is an exceptional leader, who is deeply committed to driving successful customer outcomes. So as we enter 2019, we\u2019re also investing in increased awareness of our company to the launch this month of our first ever brand campaign, while many decision makers already know us well, this campaign is designed to increase awareness of ServiceNow more broadly with C-suite executives. The campaign highlights our focus as a digital workflow company, creating great experiences and unlocking productivity. That is what digital transformation is all about and that is the future of work. The intelligent and intuitive capabilities of our Now platform and our IT employee and customer workflows make work simpler, easier, and faster across the enterprise. Simply put, we make the world of work, work better for people. That\u2019s our focus and our commitment. So in closing, I\u2019m very pleased with the strong quarter and year and our continued momentum. We are making continued progress against our strategic priorities led by our focus on product innovation and customer success. And now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, John. Q4 was a strongest quarter ever and we have a lot of momentum as we begin in the New Year. During the quarter, we booked $1.5 billion in total contract value and our total backlog including deferred revenue, as of December 31, was $5.1 billion, representing 38% year-over-year adjusted growth, including $112 million of foreign exchange headwind. Q4 subscription revenues were $666 million, representing 35% year-over-year adjusted growth, including $7 million of foreign exchange headwind. Our Q4 subscription billings were $952 million, representing 39% year-over-year adjusted growth, including $11 million of foreign exchange headwind and $4 million of duration tailwind. And our Q4 total billings crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time ever. I\u2019d also like to note that Q4 billings continues to grow seasonally stronger is our largest new bookings and renewals quarter each year, which compounds into larger Q4 billings over time. We expect this dynamic will continue and therefore will impact the seasonality of billings in other quarters throughout the year. Our strong top line performance was driven by 51 new transactions greater than $1 million, six of which were new ServiceNow customers. IT transformations continue to be the catalyst for new customer relationships. We reaccelerated growth across our IT workflow throughout 2018, underscoring the massive opportunity remaining for ServiceNow to lead customers through their digital transformations. The remaining 45 transactions greater than $1 million were expansions of existing customer relationships across our full suite of enterprise workflow solutions highlighted by every one of our products outperforming expectations. Moving to Q4 profitability. Operating margin was 21% and free cash flow margin was 34% which was driven by strong Q4 collections and improved DSOs. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance. For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $715 million and $720 million, representing 35% to 36% year-over-year adjusted growth, including approximately $21 million of foreign exchange headwind. We expect subscription billings between $790 million and $795 million, representing 30% to 31% year-over-year adjusted growth, including approximately $23 million of foreign exchange headwind and $18 million of duration headwind. We expect a 16% operating margin and 190 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter. For 2019, we expect subscription revenues between $3.215 billion and $3.235 billion, representing 34% to 35% year-over-year adjusted growth, including approximately $41 million of foreign exchange headwind. We expect subscription billings between $3.705 billion and $3.725 billion, representing 31% to 32% year-over-year adjusted growth, including approximately $45 million and $22 million of foreign exchange and duration headwind respectively. We expect 2019 subscription gross margins of 86%, operating margin of 21%, free cash flow margin of 28%, and 190 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. To conclude on our 2018 performance, we\u2019re very pleased with the top line returns from investments made throughout the year and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the priorities, John outlined in his prepared remarks. Our goal is to build an enduring company and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunity in front of us. Before closing, please note our Financial Analyst Day will be held on Monday, May 6 in Las Vegas in conjunction with our Annual Users' Conference, Knowledge 18. In-person, attendance will be limited. So if interested, please send an email to ir@servicenow.com. For those who cannot join in-person, we will hold the webcast of the event accessible on our IR website. With that operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on a really nice fiscal year. John, just given the strength here, seeing and really big deals and the upsell momentum, you\u2019re having in G2 2000 [ph]. I was just curious, are you starting to faceoff with different buyers sets in the customer base? Meaning, yes, I think one of the opportunities has been to expand or take service now to being more of an enterprise platform, not just sort of an IT platform. I\u2019m just kind of curious, where you think you are on that journey based on who you\u2019re speaking with these days. And then Mike, to your point on seasonality and billings in the fourth quarter getting bigger, as we think about the full year, as we model billings, is there anything else we should take into account in terms of just seasonality as we get past the first quarter? Thanks. John Donahoe : Yes, Kurt. I think what\u2019s happening is, frankly largely driven by what\u2019s happening at customers. That as customers are embracing digital transformation and digital transformation, I can\u2019t emphasize this enough. There\u2019s even the time I\u2019ve been here, it\u2019s not a business buzzword in these companies anymore. It\u2019s actually course for strategic reality, in fact, survival in some companies. It\u2019s forcing them to think in more across functional way. And so just give an example, there\u2019s a lot more focused on the end-to-end employee experience. For two reasons, one, that everyone wants to digitally connect with their employees in a world where we got to \u2013 recruit millennials and retain them and everyone wants productivity. And so that requires an employee experiences by definition cross functional, where an employee doesn\u2019t really care if they\u2019re dealing with IT or HR or finance or facilities. And so we\u2019re seeing more and more customer initiatives, where they\u2019re looking for cross functional support to drive a better employee experience. So IT\u2019s involved, but they\u2019re partnering with their CHRO or HR. They\u2019re partnering with facilities or partnering with finance. And so I use several examples where I was at major Fortune 100 customers and all those people were in the room and they\u2019re turning to us saying, we want to build an end-to-end employee experience and we believe your platform connects effectively in with many of the other core systems of record, be it a Concur for T&A or an AFE for payroll or Workday for an HCM, or many others. And they look to us to stitch the workflow together. And so just that often these sales are our joint sales. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re only in IT or only in HR or only in customer service. Increasingly, you\u2019re seeing a kind of a shared services mindset. And I think we\u2019re benefiting from that because our platform really does help a lot of workflow around each of the other systems of record, in a way that allows the customer to get the benefit. So and I think our sales teams and our PLS teams are responding well to that. But it\u2019s in many ways the cross functional message, that is most powerful and distinct in our customers. Michael Scarpelli : And Kirk on your question on billings, Q1 is seasonally our lowest billings quarter. In 2018, we did see our billings increase, the growth rate was increasing every quarter. I will say a lot of that was driven by the strong outperformance we had especially in the second half of the year, last year. And I do expect that our billings will continue to get stronger as we go. But I\u2019m not forecasting it to be as stronger growth as last year, just much bigger numbers. Kirk Materne : Super. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results. John, obviously your billings guidance was great. When you talk to executives, can you give us a sense of what sort of the overall view of tech spending in 2018? And then how do I think about prioritizing your revenue of digital transformation versus other areas of spend? And then maybe just a quick follow-up, you commented that ITSM reaccelerated in 2018. I\u2019m wondering if you could put your finger on sort of what drove that reacceleration this year. Thanks. John Donahoe : Yes, Matt. On outlook, I\u2019m not sure that, we had anything you need to say on that. In that most of our customers are under the gun to be honest, to deliver strong digital transformation results and digital transformation results, as I said a few minutes ago, include better employee and customer experiences and productivity. And so we still, as we look into 2019, we can\u2019t really forecast macroeconomics and we\u2019re not going to try too, but we see companies continuing to invest in technology as a core enabler of digital transformation. And then our focus is very much on demonstrating business value, demonstrating economic value. The fact is we automate workflows. In automated workflows, he has to provide better experiences, but they also drive productivity. And so even in an environment if spend gets tougher over time, we want to be at the top of the list as a productivity enhancer. And we believed that we are. And so without being able to predict the future, work kind of going full steam ahead. And I haven\u2019t seen any major changes in customers yet, but obviously, none of us don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know, but focus on productivity, focus on business value, that\u2019s the long cycle view. And then on ITSM, this is \u2013 to be honest, I think, we \u2013 the narrative got ahead of the reality around our ITSM when we started publishing, we\u2019re in 75% of the Fortune 500. That the reality is we frequently land in a division or in a geography or in a part of a company. And so even with the ITSM, we may land in only one part of the company. And so there\u2019s absolutely be opportunity to expand across the enterprise. And increasingly, I think as companies see the power of the ITSM product and see the power of automating and providing self-help for IT service management that you\u2019re seeing more enterprise-wide initiatives. So existing customers that\u2019s driving expansion, where we are already won enterprise-wide initiative and a new customers you\u2019re seeing, they\u2019re starting off with more enterprise-wide initiatives and that\u2019s sometimes in centralized companies, but it\u2019s also increasingly decentralized companies, where you may have five or six different branded divisions as saying. You know what, there\u2019s only one way to do IT service management and let\u2019s get to a common way. So we provide better, again, I\u2019m saying the same things, better employee experience, better productivity and it\u2019s kind of real. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. I\u2019ll also add Matt that I think we\u2019re seeing the benefit of the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years on really improving our overall IT portfolio and some of the focus we\u2019ve had around the whole user experience and other things. That\u2019s really driving that with both existing customers and new customers. Matt Hedberg : Super helpful. Well done. Thanks guys. John Donahoe : And we\u2019re both really excited about the next step of that this coming here in mobile. Yes, that kind of mobile experiences, consumer grade mobile experiences, we had coming out in the next \u2013 little bit in the next release, but then in New York this summer. Awesome mobile experiences. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Sarah Hindlian : All right, great. Thank you so much John and Mike. John, congrats on your two-year anniversary and to you both on the $50 million of outperformance. On that point, John, I\u2019m looking at the top 20 data and all the regional data, and the strength, it looks very broad based, but it\u2019s also the biggest fee you\u2019ve had in, it looks like, seven quarters. So can you help just tone in a little bit on exactly what drove that? And then second, actually, I\u2019d like to squeeze in two for you Mike. But given the growth you\u2019re seeing, are you thinking at all differently versus your last update on margins given this significant growth? And then I need to ask about federal. I haven\u2019t heard it come up. With the shutdown in your recurring model, can you just give us a little bit of color as to if anything and what you guys did see within your business? Thanks. I appreciate it. John Donahoe : Sure, Sarah. I\u2019ll start that out. So the performance this year, we really just saw strength across the Board as we said in all of our products, but all of our deals as well too. Every deal hit their targets, but what really stood out was EMEA had a fabulous year and fabulous quarter. Americas which were the most penetrated had a fabulous year and quarter as well too, in APJ outperformed for the year. So I can\u2019t call out any one thing. I just think it\u2019s really the fruit of all the investments we been making over the last number of years. And then in particular, some of the things we\u2019re starting to see with customer success is driving customer to buying more from us. In terms of the federal business, the federal shutdown, I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re getting to, that potentially will have an impact, but we think we\u2019ll get the results before the end of the year. Q3 is obviously our big federal quarter. So defense is our biggest customer within the U.S. government and this type of the shutdown really isn\u2019t being impacted that at all from what we see and talking to our federal sales team. But as I said it\u2019s really Q3 and that\u2019s a big federal quarter. In terms of our operating margin guidance, we set that out at our Analyst Day and what the results of what we\u2019re seeing in 2018 give us the confidence that we should invest more because of the opportunity we\u2019re seeing. And hence while we are giving the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year, so we said it was the minimum. We would do it in our Analyst Day and we\u2019re keeping our free cash flow margins flat to start the year out more really focused on growth and I think you\u2019ve seen the growth in 2018. I don\u2019t think anyone probably could grow at the size we are at the rates we\u2019ve been doing. Sarah Hindlian : All right. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the question, really impressive results for the quarter and for the year. And it was quite impressive hearing every product outperformed the expectations in the quarter, but specific to emerging products now representing 30% of net new ACV versus 25% a year ago. Can you maybe drill down a little bit into which one of these products you\u2019re seeing the most adoption? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up. Michael Scarpelli : I mean, it\u2019s all of them in many ways. There\u2019s not massive variability across them. Interestingly, one of the things and we began talking about this in Q4. We are refining how we\u2019re sort of positioning our platform and the products to be more in terms that align with how customers think about it and you heard me talk about this in Q4 where we\u2019re saying in essence we\u2019re the digital workflow platform that\u2019s what we do, that\u2019s our unique role in the sort of modern tech stack of the future and we\u2019re a platform with free workflows, right? And we are first and foremost a platform. We have an IT workflow and that\u2019s all about is helping the CIO create the IT department of the future, help them move into the future and that includes ITOM, IT Business Management, IT analytics and many of our IT-related products. Our second major bucket if you will is employee experience workflow and this gets to what I was talking about earlier in the call, where customers are thinking about is how do they deliver a strong end-to-end employee experience. And so frankly, we put ITSM in there along with HR case management employee on-boarding and our other products that tie together to enable the IT experience. And then last is the customer service of workflow and that\u2019s where a growing number of customers want to replicate for their customers what we enable them to do with their employees namely get to the root cause of the problem, fix it, so it doesn\u2019t happen again and when a problem \u2013 a customer does contact them enable self-help and automation wherever possible. And so by grouping the 10, 12 products we have into those three groups if you will, those two workflows. It aligns more of how customers think about the business problems that they\u2019re trying to address. And CJ, kind of refined his product organization in Q, in the beginning of this quarter to align with that. And so I think it\u2019s going to enable us to continue to in some ways simplify our message and get to the right decision makers at the right strategic level. Michael Scarpelli : I want to stress that this is really will not change external reporting for us. This is really just the way we deal with customers and talk to customers and so don\u2019t explain changes there. John Donahoe : And we\u2019re not reorganizing sales teams or product line specialists because that\u2019s go-to-market motion is working. So this is just a matter of I\u2019ll sort of simplifying and ensuring the various products stitched together in an effective way. Brad Zelnick : Thanks so much guys. And just a follow-up, I get a lot of questions from investors as we look out on the horizon to achieving $10 billion and beyond. Can you give us any update on how you\u2019re thinking and progress has evolved on corporate development and M&A since we talked about this topic at Analyst Day? Thanks so much. John Donahoe : Brad, as I said in Analyst Day priority one, two and three is to execute against our organic opportunities which continue to be enormous. And so shame on us if we take our eye off the ball against our organic growth opportunities. Priority two is to invest in additional organic innovation and with our affirmation of our NowX group, which is went during 2018 this is one of the areas that we\u2019re investing in as Mike talked about earlier. We\u2019ve gone from two engineers in NowX to 20 engineers \u2013 sorry 50 engineers in NowX. 100% focused on developing new products that will come out in two, three years. And so, now this year, I think we\u2019ll launch one to two new products and we\u2019ll try to do that routine. So organic innovation has been one of the remarkable hallmarks of this company and is one we\u2019re committed to continuing to pursue. And then as we look forward as I said in the spring and we did more work on later in the year to $10 billion and beyond and often you have \u2013 you can selectively use M&A to create other growth engines. It\u2019s not out of meeting the by growth or out of defensive necessity, it\u2019s about how do we \u2013 in a very strategic way find additional growth engines over time. We\u2019re not in any rush to do it. Interestingly, our customers are pointing us to some. Our customers are saying, hey, man if you guys \u2013 we\u2019d really like if you can help transform IT. If you can take a look at these types of companies or those and we see some others, so we\u2019ll continue to monitor. Nothing\u2019s imminent, but when we see something that we think is added to our portfolio and positions us on that $5 billion to $10 billion we won\u2019t be shy about pursuing it. Brad Zelnick : Fantastic, John and Mike, thank you so much. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. And congrats from me as well. Can you talk a little bit because we are starting the new year about the changes or no changes to the sales organization. Maybe you kind of double-click on the Dave Schneider getting a bigger role as well and how that will play out for you and then I had a follow on for Mike. John Donahoe : Well, maybe I\u2019ll just talk a little bit about Dave and then Mike you can put changes in the sales organization the context that compared to previous years as well. So I\u2019ll just say, first I\u2019ll say is Dave Schneider is just a spectacular leader. And he\u2019s known for along with Kevin Haverty, he\u2019s kind of a Godfather of the ServiceNow best-in-class go-to-market organization. I heard about that before. I\u2019ve joined this company I had the privilege to see him up close and personal since I\u2019ve been here. And seen Dave\u2019s incredible leadership and followership he engenders. And Dave has always been someone that cares a lot around the customer results not just selling in, but understanding that if our platform and product help customers get results then expansion becomes a healthy and sustainable opportunity. And so what we are doing is not trying to do sales and customer success in two different parts of the organization, but Dave is stitching together the full end-to-end customer life cycle. And we think there\u2019s a real opportunity to do it differently and do it well. And so we made \u2013 Dave and the team made nice progress in 2018 and we\u2019re very excited. We just had our sales kick-off last week. It was the most aligned end-to-end customer sort of mindset that we talked about formula for success for our customers. And we\u2019re excited about taking that forward to 2019 and beyond. And you want answer how \u2013 the specific changes in the sales team? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. What I would say Raimo there\u2019s no material changes \u2013 its all through the structure of our sales organization going into 2019. If you recall the last major change was in Q1 of 2015. It will be just a normal tweaking of the sales organization. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in enterprise were access were our focus is, we\u2019re still investing in commercial so that will involve splitting territories, but not moving reps from one class to another. And we will continue. We continue to look at verticalization real no decisions there. We\u2019re going to kind of try a few things, but no major changes at all to our sales organization, why? Because it\u2019s been working. And we don\u2019t want to mess that up. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Justin Furby : Thanks guys. And congrats on solid results. John, I wanted to ask about the ISV community. You guys are building and I think the platform\u2019s clearly a powerful part of your story I know it has been. But my sense is that \u2013 it\u2019s still sort of an untapped opportunity in terms of building out the store and monetizing it. Thus I\u2019m wondering, if you can maybe give a sense for how big you think that opportunity can be for you when you look out over the next five, seven years? And is there any reason why you think longer term it couldn\u2019t be something like it\u2019s become for sales force? So do you think of it, it in a different way? Thanks. John Donahoe : Thanks, Justin. First of all, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re based in Chicago, where I grew up, but if you are, please stay inside and stay warm. Justin Furby : Yes. I\u2019m inside for sure. John Donahoe : Yes. My father and sister and family are there and they\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s a little chilly. Let me just start with platform. We are fundamentally a platform company. And a significant and our customers recognize that. That was one of the thing instructed most when I first joined the company how many customers led with it \u2013 say things like, I love your products, but I really love your platform. It\u2019s easy to build on, it\u2019s fast and it\u2019s extensible. And so already we have many developers in our customers building in our platform and that, and so we\u2019re continuing to make investments in the platform to enable that or we call it platform-as-a-business. Josh Callan took over that product earlier this year and it\u2019s an important area of investment because when customers build their applications on our platform the propensity for them to buy our prepackage applications and to expand is simply hard. And so \u2013 and to provide a growing really product development laboratory for us because we see where our customers are building and where they want us to build something out-of-the-box. And then our ISV programs you said is still relatively in its early stages. We\u2019ve got a good strong leader there, Avanish. And I characterize it in early days. We\u2019re trying to encourage people building vertical solutions. We think that\u2019s one of the real sweet spots where our platform is fundamentally horizontal. As Mike mentioned we\u2019re kind of verticalizing our go-to-market a little bit. But there are certain industry use cases is that to be honest we\u2019re never going to build the specific use case for that industry. And so we\u2019re trying to find and encourage partners who can build something that\u2019s customized to specific into use case and that creates a win-win for the end-customer, for the partner and for us. And so I think the analogy you talked about earlier is very much possible and achievable. Maybe even more so in a world where platforms are becoming more and more important. And the number of apps in our store grew 100% last year. The number of ISV partner transactions grew 124%. So the metrics are good but it started a pretty small base and we want to continue to focus on it. We think it\u2019s one of those organic growth opportunities is that we think is still in its early days. Justin Furby : Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Rob Owens : Great. Thank you. While you\u2019re on the topic of partners, maybe you could share some of the success you saw this year with what was partner influence and it ticked up I think over the first three quarters relative to percentage, but still is modest overall. So just like an update I guess relative to fourth quarter contribution on what\u2019s partner influence and how we should think about 2019 relative to that metric? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. What I would say, Rob is there\u2019s a partner involved in almost every one of our large deals that we do. In terms of as you know very little of our business goes through the channel, but our deals are heavily influenced by our partners. And we think it was somewhere for the full-year or for Q4 you look at our top deals. It was 79% influenced. And source was 29% that\u2019s worked through the channel. Rob Owens : Sure. John Donahoe : But, what I would say, we\u2019re getting better. Again we have a nice new strong leader in [indiscernible] Ecosystem, David Parsons who\u2019s joined us in the fourth quarter. And just in the last 60 days we\u2019ve had talked to tops with three of our top four at size. And I can tell you that they\u2019re all saying comparable things to us namely that ServiceNow is one of, if not the largest practice. Or I\u2019m sorry one of is that we \u2013 fastest growth practice. We want to go home, the largest practice. That\u2019s the aspiration. But we\u2019re getting better in partnering with them and that\u2019s on both sides. Mike said 12-months ago, we not had aligned people talking to aligns people. And today we have I\u2019ll take vendor who runs our European business. He\u2019s made a real effort to ensure that our UK leader and specific account execs on UK accounts are talking to their partner counterparts on those accounts. So there\u2019s a more joint planning at accounts. There\u2019s more joint sales campaigns. And so I think we are in some ways use the reference inside than the scale of one to 10 where 10\u2019s from our past we\u2019ve gone from a two to four in the last year. We\u2019re twice as good as over a year ago, that we are \u2013 a formal want to be 10 plus and the partner still in the same way. So it\u2019s getting increased attention. I think a strong leadership from Dave Parsons and aligned organization is now embracing partners recognizing that you can\u2019t get to digital transformation, which is software. It\u2019s just a platform. You need a really strong partner to help reengineer the processes and ensure that the implementation is done in high quality out-of-the-box manner. So partners are very important to our success, and we\u2019re going to continue to get better and better at making sure we operate strategically and effectively with it. Rob Owens : Great. And then John, since you provided the segue again for me. I guess on the international front. You talked about the acceleration. Any changes behind that international acceleration? Is it just maturation or is it more of your go-to-market efforts? John Donahoe : I think on \u2013 there\u2019s no simple answer to that, but I\u2019ll just make maybe one or two observations that these are not silver bullets, but they\u2019re among things. Our European team has done a really nice job of being innovators inside of our company. And so Philip and team were the first that they identified the top 35 strategic accounts in Europe. And they did the best account planning of one of our leaders Michael Moss there has a template that we just rolled out in our sales kicked off. Michael ran Northern Europe and he has a template of how we build a strategic plan with the customer a shared strategic plan around their company strategic priorities around the CIO\u2019s priorities or in the business outcomes they\u2019re trying drive in digital transformation, and how the Now Platform is helping them achieve those outcomes to achieve the results. And so I guess my add and look at the math of those exact 35 accounts, but I the kind of account coverage and dialogue and elevating their way into the strategic into the C-suite they\u2019ve done a really nice job in Europe and as well on the frontline tell our peer [ph] people partner with customer success, people with partnering with \u2013 talk about any specialized who partner with the inspired team. In some places in the U.S. we\u2019re just building from one another. Often, in our European offices they\u2019re on the same floor. And so it really has helped us lead the way in some ways internally about best practices about how we can have a real strategic conversation with the customer. And drive toward customer value and outcomes and then that leads to the expansion. And that is, it\u2019s not rocket science, but it\u2019s a formula that\u2019s proving its way out. Anything you want to add, Mike? Michael Scarpelli : I\u2019d like to add to that. I think a lot of the investments that Philip has made over the last few years in new sales leadership in Europe is really paying off as well too, because remember this is a long sales cycle. When you change the leader many times they change people out and I think we have a very stable sales organization in Europe. We may make some big investments in Germany in 2018 and I think they\u2019re going to pay off any time in 2019 and 2020. And so I think leadership is really what\u2019s been driving a lot of the performance in EMEA. Rob Owens : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask about the six, $1 million plus deals that were new customer of ServiceNow in the quarter. A couple of questions. First, of those deals were any of them driven by non-core ITSM, where the customer came in because of either HR CSM? And then the second question, I have on that is was there any change in who ServiceNow is competing against and/or what they are replacing in those deals? John Donahoe : So, what I would say is in those deals there was a some CSM in HR but IT was in all of those deals as well too and it\u2019s still IT, which is the main driver. One there was HR that helped drive it. And as I said this is the biggest project, there\u2019s other things as well. It\u2019s the regular people that we\u2019re replacing all the time. It\u2019s still it needed larger accounts it\u2019s pretty big and they tend to be HPE or BMC depending on what the company shows and we\u2019re still seeing those replacements. Michael Scarpelli : And I guess some of those small accounts we\u2019re seeing CSM right there\u2019s down -- certainly in the commercial segment, there are a number of new customers starting with the CSM product and then migrating their way and that\u2019s often, because they have a Chief Operating Officer, who oversees all elements of that, but not as much in the upper level. Samad Samana : And then, maybe Mike just one follow up. In terms of was there any on-premise revenue in the quarter? I think you called it out for the third quarter. I know Federal tends to drive more of that than your enterprise customers, but just \u2013 how much was done from its revenue this year in the fourth quarter versus last year? Michael Scarpelli : In the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter was $29 million in comparison to $26 million in Q4 of 2017. That\u2019s actually down from Q3, Q3 tends to be our biggest on-prem, because that\u2019s a big federal quarter and a lot of federal customers are on-prem due to security requirements. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks again guys. That was a great quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Hey, my question is for Mike. Just wondering on the metrics here as we look forward now. You\u2019ve had about a year in some time to look at the backlog number and help maybe us understand how to think about that would be helpful. And I think kind of tough looking at billings as sort of a leading indicator. How do you think about billings and backlog now as you had more time under your belt just looking, how those play out? Michael Scarpelli : We will continue for 2019 to give guidance around billings and you will see the backlog and our Qs when we file our Qs as required under 606. Walter Pritchard : And just -- and maybe a follow up to that Mike. And just, in terms of managing the business. How do you think about sort of managing on those two metrics then as we orient our models going forward? Should we be should -- actually [indiscernible] or not? Michael Scarpelli : The way we manage the business and now we have managed the business is net new ACV. And you see that annually in the proxy and you will get a proxy for it by now seeing the backlog on a quarterly basis and the disclosures around what\u2019s going to roll up over the next 12-months. That\u2019s how we manage the business. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits : Hi, guys. Good quarter. Just one for Mike and one for John. First, for John, how do you think about expansion strategically in two areas? One security? And two in ITOM. And then for Mike just a clarification with IT up 58% of new ACV this quarter. Is that only because everything else grew so fast or if we did the math what we come out with less growth in the fourth quarter? I know you said you did well for the year? John Donahoe : Yes, Mike. let me \u2013 I\u2019ll say what I always say. We start with the customer in mind and we listen to our customers. And as we think about the IT workflow that group of products what we\u2019re asking CIOs and what they\u2019re asking us is how we can help them build the modern IT shop at the future. And so our ITOM business, our ITOM product, which had a very strong year is an increasing with the service mapping or some of the other products within ITOM. They view is important and so we\u2019re investing in that. And we\u2019re trying to ensure that we have both modern, we have both legacy ITOM capabilities and modern ITOM capabilities. So, I think that will continue to be an area of investment and focus. And then in security, it\u2019s to be clear we play a \u2013 I\u2019ll call it a fairly narrow role or a specific role in security. We do infinite response and vulnerability response. And in many ways that should take into core competence of what our platform does and applying it to IT use or \u2013 I \u2019m sorry, security use cases. And so, I don\u2019t see us getting into fundamentally new areas of security, where there are already solutions existing. If they\u2019re natural extensions of our platform that help a CIO or CITOs build a better overall security experience or better all security portfolio. Then we\u2019ll look at it. But it\u2019s not a market segment per se. We\u2019re going to say, let\u2019s pursue it, because it\u2019s a very crowded and frankly fragmented arena. In an area that we do see and we initially have this in our security organization, but it\u2019s really, it\u2019s partly security-related, but it\u2019s, I think some are distinct. We see a lot of demand for GRC government risk and compliance, government risk and compliance. And as audit committees and CIOs, CISOs, CFOs look for greater scrutiny around those three separate, but related areas. Our GRC product in our platform, we think has enormous opportunity. And so, GRC product group grew very aggressively in 2018. I think, we will continue in 2019, I\u2019ll just tell one small story of the kind of thing \u2013 I think we can see more of. I had a CIO of probably a global point company called me last year. And it said, John, ServiceNow is my one source of truth for our GRC and how we \u2013 and I have to report to the Audit Committee every quarter on our enterprise risk. Why can\u2019t I just show the ServiceNow dashboard to my Audit Committee as the authoritative, dashboard authoritative source of the enterprisewide risk data? And could you work with our accountants and in this case, it was quite far us to see if you can get it balanced and validated. And so that whether that happens exactly or not we\u2019re working on it, but more yet the kind of customer demand, where they\u2019re saying we\u2019ve got so much going on in governance risk and compliance and if I can pull it together through a coherent instead of metrics and dashboards, I can run my business, manage and avoid risk and ensure that we\u2019re compliant. That\u2019s an area. I don\u2019t know if you call that security enough, but that\u2019s an area I don\u2019t if you call that security or not, but that\u2019s an area we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for ServiceNow our platform is uniquely positioned to help a strong solution on that. Michael Scarpelli : So, on your question with regards to growth. IT was very strong for the full year. It was strong in Q4, but emerging growth was very strong in Q4. That shadow that and you can see that in the IR deck. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Sanjit Singh : Hi, this is Sanjit Singh. Thank you for taking the questions and squeezing me in. I wanted to revisit some of the topic that was said a little bit earlier and just to which of these opportunities we feel is going to be most impactful to the business? On one hand you have \u2013 John, as you said you mentioned helping CIOs reinvent IT and then on the other side of the equation you\u2019re seeing \u2013 you\u2019re helping customers to digitize the front office. And maybe a way of framing it \u2013 if Michael came here John, but we haven\u2019t \u2013 we found another $100 million in the budget, where would you deploy that $100 million in terms of those two -- in terms of the various opportunities you have in front of you first? Michael Scarpelli : Trying to say it again. For me, to make sure I understand. Sanjit Singh : Yes. So \u2013 just \u2013 if you think about this is the core IT business and helping customers reinvent the IT department or an IT operations and then areas like HR and customer service, where you guys are seeing large-size deals, which of those sort of opportunities you brawl that you think is going to be the most impactful to the business whether it\u2019s in ROI or the durability of growth or anywhere that you want to frame it? Michael Scarpelli : The answer to your question is, yes. I would just say that even IT will continue to be extremely impactful to our business for a very long time. That is the core of our business. And as we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re very excited about CSM and HR because they land new opportunities for us without being an IT. And but we\u2019re excited about all of our emerging products and then your question around if we have another $100 million, where would we invest it, where we do go down in customer service management, I mean that\u2019s an massive opportunity. John Donahoe : Yes, I mean \u2013 just one more comment, I\u2019d make. The software for the last 30 years has been very functionally defined and functionally bought. And that may have improved operations and functions, but it didn\u2019t really drive great productivity, better experiences at work, because actually most business processes at work for employees and customers are fundamentally cross-functional in nature. And what a cloud platform like ServiceNow does is that enables a cross-functional using software, using platform to drive cross-functional processes. And so I think what we\u2019re seeing is even the distinctions and historical it\u2019s might \u2013 back from the first answer I gave in this call around the end-to-end employee experience. When you think digital transformation inside a company. you\u2019ve got to think cross-functionally. Even our Customer Service Management product is when a customer has a problem you\u2019re getting to the root cause of that problem. The root cause often touches product legal, compliance, engineering, marketing. And so it\u2019s cross-functional in nature. Our platform is uniquely positioned to drive cross-functional workflow. And so you won\u2019t see IC or Gartner really make us cut like that, but I do think it is one of the things that\u2019s filling our growth is that unlocking that kind of productivity. As for the incremental $100 million, we\u2019ve got five priorities and the five priorities remain in 2018. We\u2019re investing in our products and platform number one. It\u2019s priority number one in our investment. Organic innovation, ensuring we don\u2019t take our foot off the gas in innovation. Number two, we\u2019re investing in an end-to-end customer \u2013 or end-to-end go-to-market motion. I\u2019ll pick both sales and customer success in it. I guess these are four. Number three, talent. We\u2019re growing at our talent globally, talents are lifeblood of any company that wants to build and endure for the long-term. And then investment priority number four in which, we just really for the first time are doing is our brand and doing things to elevate our company brand. I hope you\u2019ve seen the fabulous ServiceNow TV commercial that we\u2019ve been running on CNBC and the Golf Channel as I mentioned in my remarks there. If there\u2019s another way we can raise our visibility with C-suite executives. Sanjit Singh : I appreciate the thoughts. Maybe just one quick follow-up, maybe from Mike. As we head into the dread release, how should we think about pricing and potential price increases as a driver in terms of your organic growth in 2019? Michael Scarpelli : Price increases are not a driver of our growth at all. They never really have been. We\u2019ve never tried to really optimize it for price per user. We\u2019ve always tried to get more usage by our customers and drive what we\u2019re extracting out of the customer not in the way when they see value in what they\u2019re getting out of ServiceNow. So that does not play into 2019 at all. Sanjit Singh : Thank you and congrats. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Pardon me. Kash Rangan, your line is now open. John Donahoe : Okay. I guess Kash has dropped off the line. So, thank you operator.

We delivered another strong quarter continuing the momentum from our outstanding 2018 performance. We are focused on driving customer success and we're expanding our footprint across almost 75% of the Fortune 500, enabling digital transformation as a strategic partner to the world's largest enterprises, and we're delivering digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock productivity. This is the future of work. Let's look at key Q1 results. In the first quarter, we closed 25 deals with ACV greater than $1 million. We now had 717 customers doing more than $1 million in business with us, which represents a 33% increase year-over-year. Our renewal rate for the quarter continued to be strong at 98%. This quarter, we saw a particular strength in the Americas region led by strong performance with U.S. federal agencies. Three of our top 10 largest net new ACV deals were with federal agencies, and we now had six federal customers doing more than $10 million in ACV with us. These results show how the public sector is embracing cloud-based solutions and it demonstrates our role as one of the core strategic partners to these government agencies helping them digitally transform how they operate serving their employees and citizens and delivering services. And our Q1 results also underscore our strong product portfolio. This quarter, our Customer Service Management product saw a significant growth with 28 customers now spending more than $1 million. Our customer workflow products enhance customer operations management. That means that our customers are able to deliver better experiences and outcomes for their customers. In fact, Customer Service Management led to one of our largest deals during the quarter. This customer evaluated a number of competitors including the legacy incumbent technology provider and they chose ServiceNow because of our operations management capabilities. This is our sweet spot, managing inbound contacts to identify the root causes of customer issues, fixing those issues so that you can prevent future problems, and automating self-help solutions. And in other areas, our IT and HR products led a large expansion deal with Humana, a Fortune 100 company. Humana is now expanding their use of the ServiceNow platform across IT and HR to enable enterprise-wide focus on improving productivity and enhancing their employee experience. Across our customer base, we saw positive response to the launch of our Madrid platform release in Q1. Early indications show that customers are adopting Madrid faster than previous releases. Madrid offers customers over 600 innovations such as new mobile-first experiences and digital workflows that unlock productivity for IT, for employees, and for customers. This customer response shows our progress in making upgrades simple and easy, ensuring customers can quickly take advantage of our latest platform and product innovations. And I'm personally very excited about the mobile capabilities we're rolling out. We're delivering easy, intuitive, out-of-the-box mobile capabilities that enable consumer-like experiences across the enterprise. These are the kind of experiences that employees expect and demand today. We\u2019ve also made significant strides in our product organization over the past year led by Chief Product Officer, CJ Desai. We have a great global product team and they're driving continuous quality enhancements and customer-focused innovation across our platform and product portfolio. This team is also focused on building a strong pipeline of product innovation as we look to meet a broader range of customer needs and leverage the power of our Now Platform across the entire enterprise. During the first quarter, I had an opportunity to visit Israel and spend time with our product teams there. As you recall, we acquired SkyGiraffe in late 2017 to enhance our mobile capabilities, and that Israeli-based team is fully integrated now. I met with this team and many other tech entrepreneurs throughout Israel. Israel has an incredible community of outstanding world-class technology talents and we're building a strong product and tech hub there with more than 125 employees to-date. I left Israel so impressed with the quality and caliber of our team and with the innovation happening there. I also traveled during the quarter to Amsterdam, Tokyo, and Sydney spending time with our teams and customers. My customer interactions worldwide continue to validate the business imperative of digital transformation. Customers continually tell me that the strength of our product portfolio and the capabilities of our Now Platform position us as one of their core strategic partners enabling digital transformation. Our focus on the Now Platform and three core workflows, IT, employee, and customer are being well received by our customers, and it's empowering our product teams to focus on delivering even more integrated digital workflow solutions that drive great experiences and unlock productivity across the enterprise. A few weeks ago, we held our first CIO Advisory Board meeting, spending two days with roughly a dozen of the top CIOs in the world. We had a rich discussion, reaffirming that we are on the right path with our strategies, our product vision, and our focus on customer success. We've also been pleased with some of the positive feedback we've received throughout the quarter in response to our first-ever company brand campaign, which launched in January and continued through early June. As I've said before, this campaign is designed to increase awareness of ServiceNow more broadly with C-Suite executives. The campaign is also resonating very well with our employees and enhancing our recruiting efforts from a talent brand perspective. We will continue to invest in company brand awareness to position ServiceNow as both a partner and employer of choice. In closing, I'm pleased with our strong start to 2019 and our continued progress against our priorities. We are committed to making the world of work, work better for people and we're focused on building key trust-based customer relationships to enable their digital transformation and create the future work. Now I know many of you are planning to join us in Las Vegas, on the week of May 6, for our financial Analyst Day and for Knowledge 2019 our seminal customer event. We expect this year's conference to be our largest-ever with 20,000 people registered to attend. Spending time with our customers is always my favorite activity and knowledge is one of the real highlights of the year. I'll look forward to seeing many of you there. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, John. In Q1, we delivered another good quarter strong top line growth combined with margin expansion. After a strong 2018, it was very important that we start 2019 off on the right foot, let's dive into the highlight from the quarter. Subscription revenues for the first quarter were $740 million, representing 40% year-over-year adjusted growth including $20 million of foreign exchange headwinds. Subscription billings were $810 million representing 33% year-over-year adjusted growth including $22 million and $18 million of foreign exchange and duration headwind respectively. Our revenue and billings performance was driven by strong bookings in the Americas. In addition, accelerated revenue recognition from self-posted deals related to our Federal business, drove the revenue outperformance. We continued to see traction across the product portfolio with 17 of our top 20 deals purchasing through more products as customers realize the power of the platform in an enterprise-wide solution. We booked four Customer Service Management deals with more than $1 million of ACV including, a $3 million deal to a federal agency, our largest CSM deal ever. We also booked a $1 million HR Service Delivery deal with the federal agency to modernize our HR processes and employee experiences with our user forum and mobile capabilities being a differentiator. Our U.S. federal business highlighted the quarter representing 15% of total net new ACV, up from 6% the prior year. We booked our largest Q1 deal ever with the federal agency who is now doing more than $18 million in ACV. We expect the U.S. federal sector will continue to purchase throughout the year as they accelerating their use of modern technology to digitally transform how they operate. We saw a strong profitability in Q1 with operating margin at 19%, driven by our revenue performance in expenses that will be realized in Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 40% and benefits from a seasonally high amount of collections from our strong Q4 billings. Now, let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $778 million and $783 million representing 35% to 36% year-over-year adjusted growth including approximately $15 million of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect subscription billings between $798 million and $803 million representing 32% to 33% year-over-year adjusted growth including approximately $17 million of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect a 17% operating margin which is impacted by Q1 expenses moving to Q2 expenses related to our annual users conference Knowledge 2019. We expect 193 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Coming off our strong Q1, we are raising our full year 2019 subscription revenue guidance to between $3.235 billion and $3.250 billion representing 35% to 36% year-over-year adjusted growth including approximately $45 million of foreign exchange headwind. We are also raising our full year 2019 subscription billings guidance to between $3.725 billion and $3.740 billion representing 32% year-over-year adjusted growth including approximately $50 million and $22 million of foreign exchange and duration headwinds respectively. While we are increasing our topline revenue guidance, we are also increasing our investments and maintaining full year 2019 margin guidance as follows; subscription gross margin of 86%; operating margin of 21%, which includes record hiring in Q1; and free cash flow margin of 28%, which includes the opening of a new pair of data center in Japan expected for later this year. For the year, we expect diluted average weighted shares outstanding of 193 million. Before closing, please note our financial Analyst Day will be held on Monday, May 6th in Las Vegas in conjunction with Knowledge 2019. For those who cannot join in person, we will hold a webcast to the event accessible at our IR website. With that operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the platform strengths this quarter? Obviously, you mentioned federal, but the 17% you got from platform still kind of seems to be like a step-up from what we've seen before. Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Well, included in that group, platform was strong, but you also have Performance Analytics in there, Raimo, as well and Performance Analytics had a very strong quarter, but platform was strong as well and we're seeing that in many of our customers. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about -- you talked about the record hiring in Q2, Mike, but you still talked about Q1 expenses kind of that slipped in Q2. Can you talk a little bit about what was going on there and the magnitude? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : So there was record hiring in Q1, and the impact of that is flowing through Q2. It was very back-end loaded, a lot of that hiring that skews as well. There were some other expenses that we are expecting to incur in Q1 that got pushed into Q2 because of timing, and we weren't ready to spend the money efficiently, so we pushed into Q2. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Well done. Congratulations. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thanks so much, and congrats on a great start to the year. My first question is for John. John the momentum you're seeing in U.S. federal is really impressive and Mike's comments suggest you're seeing a lot more demand in this market throughout the year. Can you help us understand the size of opportunity in context of 15% of your ACV mix today and where can it go? And how do you think about this translating to other governments around the world, looking to transform the citizen engagement in the way government employees work? John Donahoe : Well, Brad, I think the way you put the question is exactly the right way to think about it. Because as I just step back, let me describe this as the public sector, and included in the public sector will be federal, state, regional, and local governments. And in the first quarter, I think in my global travel, I met with all flavors of that. Simply put, those institutions are under more pressure than ever to deliver better experiences for their employees and their citizens and to drive real productivity in a time of economic challenge. And the key thing is that they are now realizing that cloud is a great way to do this. And by and large, they\u2019ve largely overcome their security concerns around the cloud. So whether it's the U.S. federal government, other federal government, state, regional, or local, we see a pretty aggressive appetite to both understand and embrace cloud. And so as you know let me just now zoom in on the U.S. federal a little bit. We, over the last several years, have built a dedicated U.S. federal team. So we've been focused on both orienting and packaging and ensuring that our platform and our products conform to the requirements of the U.S. federal agencies. Then in 2018, that was roughly 10% of our ACV, and as Mike mentioned in Q1 this year it was roughly 15%. And over time, it's hard to gauge any given piece. But I think Mike and I, we both say that overall public sector when you add not just the U.S. federal government but other federal government, state, and local could be up to 20% of our business over time. Michael Scarpelli : I would agree. There\u2019s no reason why it can't be 20% for us from what we're seeing right now. John Donahoe : And one of the interesting things Brad, that is, to me one of the most exciting pieces of this is that interestingly these government public sector organizations are often some of the most innovative users of our platform. And what\u2019s interesting is these federal agencies and many of the state and regional in Australia, U.K. and other markets, think platform first and they see the power of our platform to adopt their ability to deliver better experiences. Let me give you an example. The Veterans Affairs, U. S. agency is adopting a ServiceNow-first philosophy both for their employees and for their customers who are veterans. And so for instance, they've got a global service desk for over 550,000 Veterans Affairs employees, powered by ServiceNow and they're using ServiceNow to allow their customers, that is the veterans, to help schedule some of their procedures in their respective hospitals. So because our assets are in the Veterans Affairs CMDB, if a veteran has to schedule an MRI, ServiceNow\u2019s platform can help that Veteran figure out which hospitals have which openings with which equipment and actually schedule their appointment. So I find it very energizing to spend time with whether its defense oriented, federal agencies or other federal agencies because they are some of the most creative and innovative users of our platform. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much for that color. And Mike, just a competitive question for you, but more in the context of pricing especially in HR and customer service clouds where you're seeing large players stepping up investments, can you talk a bit about pricing trends and average discount specifically in those clouds? Thank you. Michael Scarpelli : Yeah. We haven't seen anything noticeable from a -- if you're talking specifically about HR as we like to say our employee experience. And we really take a different approach to those other vendors. Those other vendors are more specific around HR more and more around enterprise service delivery for our employees, and we're still seeing adoption by our customers jointly with whether it's a Workday or SuccessFactor or even extend the life of the Peoplesoft implementation. So, no change there. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, John, just to start-off with, given the success you'll had in the federal government in related to someone unique how are you thinking just about the broader virtualization of your sales organization as you go deeper into big enterprises sort of being able to speak the language of industry and be able to serve help them solve their biggest problems? I guess, how are you thinking about that evolving as you look out maybe over the next 12 to 24 months? John Donahoe : Kirk, it's an area that we're leading into. And as you've mentioned, federal was sort of the first area where we really focused on it and that is both a go-to-market motion where you have dedicated people who speak the language, but also tailoring the product to making sure we're meeting the federal security and other requirements. Second area, I think you know as we have a dedicated we call meds life team, but a dedicated team around some of the health care market. Again both to meet the go-to-market expectations of those customers that we understand their deep needs and to ensure that our product complies with the regulatory compliance requirements and the healthcare sector broadly defined, and obviously there are several subsectors within health care. The third area where we have a I would call a quasi formal vertical financial services. Now, this is just by virtue the large portion of the financial services world is either in New York or London. And so if you were to look at our New York and London teams, you see a lot of dedicated resources toward the financial services sector obviously within that you've got banking, you've got insurance you have other sub sectors. And their response to go-to-market motion also some focus on the encryption and other security requirements required for compliance and regulatory capabilities. And then, so those three, I would say were furthers to long and we're increasing to invest in those and making sure that they're becoming more globally oriented in our ability to share experience and our ability to ensure that we are tying our road maps to them. And then we have a set of next verticals to telecom that's an area where again the needs are very common globally whether you're Telstra in Australia or AT&T or Verizon in the U.S. or Softbank in Japan. And so that's an area where I would say is next on our stage to building out a global -- a bit of a global vertical focus. Kirk Materne : Great. Thanks very much. John Donahoe : Sure. I'll just finish up, Kirk, there are couple of others -- variety of others that where it's more packaging and communicating that we understand industry, we speak their language, we can share best practice and those would be further down the road. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. I'll pass it on to others. Congrats on the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : All right, great. Thank you so much and thank you for taking my questions and congrats. I'll add my congratulations on really nice start to the year. My first is for you John. John, as you're looking at digital workflows, how are you thinking about the next near adjacencies for you guys? And maybe you could give as an update on how you're thinking about your M&A strategy as well as this time? And then Mike I have a follow-up for you. It would be great if you could give us a little bit of incremental color on what you're seeing in terms of new logo addition, I think in particular, in international market? Thanks guys. John Donahoe : Sarah on the first part of your question in terms of organic product innovation, I think we talked before that we, at the beginning of last year, formed something we call NowX, which is a dedicated team focused on defining and building products that will launch one to three years out. And what's interesting is we have an abundance of ideas. So , -- and as ideas that come from our customers, ideas that come from developers, ideas that come from our people. And frankly, many of these ideas come from examples where customers have built a automated workflow on our platform and they come to us and said, hey, we just did this -- we built this for our own use, but we would love it if you build it out-of-the-box. And so what the NowX team, which is now up to well over 100 people do is they take all of these ideas on top of the funnel, they prioritize, work their way down to basically build-out working prototypes of let's say three to five, may be eight of them and then actually get some early, I'll call it, alpha customers to see if they really resonate and then get the beta customer to see if they come out and if they are have the kind of value we think they do and that our goal is that each knowledge to announce one to two -- I don't know if you call them new products. I'd called them extensions -- adjacent extensions of product portfolio and you will hear about one of those this coming Knowledge. And so I think you'll see a series of incremental new capabilities and new products that come out of us each year building that organic innovation muscle is really important. And then M&A, M&A to-date has largely been focused on what I would call aqua hires that's probably defined as acquiring technologies and teams that help build-out and accelerate the platform. We'll continue to do those. But if and when we see opportunities to acquire adjacent capabilities, acquire new growth engines, we'll -- obviously, we've got the resource to do it, we'll act on it. One of the luxuries we have is the luxury of choice and time, because we have such a strong organic innovation agenda. Michael Scarpelli : And then, Sarah, on your question with regards to new logo acquisitions. What I'll remind you, is roughly 80% plus of our net new ACV comes from existing customers. So the new logos don't contribute a big piece of net new ACV in any point in quarter but that is the future for those upsells. With regard to new logos, we did add about 200 new logos in the quarter and that compares with all of 2018. We had about 1,000, I think. If you look at that, it was about 50% North America and 50% rest of the world. I will say North America was really driven by our federal as we said earlier; it was the one that really outperformed in our net new ACV. I would say EMEA and APJ were a little light, but that's because they came off such a fabulous 2018 and we knew Q1 going into that, when we gave guidance, is going to be a tiger quarter. Sarah Hindlian : All right. That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats from me as well. And I guess, for either of you ITSM was included I believe in 15 of the top 20 deals this quarter. And I think you talked last year about how ITSM reaccelerated. I guess, I'm wondering, did you see that same trend this quarter? And can you put a finer point on maybe what's driving such strong results in your core? Michael Scarpelli : I would say, the ITSM, there was no reacceleration in ITSM in Q1. But ITSM was -- ITSM and IT products in general were extremely strong for us and continue to be the big driver of our net new ACV and we expect that to continue throughout the year, especially when we're landing new logos. But there's still a lot of room for expansion with our existing customers, within ITSM. John Donahoe : Just building on that Matt, what Mike was saying that, here's what I think can be a little misleading. And I think frankly us as -- we as an organization really brings us aggressively last year and may be late 2017, but throughout last year. We may have an ITSM presence in a large global bank, but it maybe in the private wealth business and not yet enterprise-wide. Or it may be in Europe, but not in the other regions. And so, when we look at, we have a strong ITSM presence in, as I said earlier, 75 of the Fortune 500 are our customers. But in many of those cases we landed in a division, or a geography, or a certain part of the organization. And we're in a world where increasingly customers want to drive platform adoption across the enterprise. And so, some reasonable portion of the ITSM growth for the 'reacceleration' is simply existing customers saying, you know what, we've got great results in division A, let's drive this enterprise-wide. We got great results in geography A, let's extend that to be a more global rollout. And so, that's why I don't think it's -- you can consider it a 'mature product'. I think that's a significant opportunity for me. Matt Hedberg : That's great. Maybe just one more quick one about GSI momentum. I know we've talked about it in the past in terms of how significant GSIs can become for you guys. I'm wondering if there's any update there. And perhaps, was that some of the strengths in platform sales this quarter? Michael Scarpelli : What's interesting, I was with Mike Lawrie from DXC yesterday. We had our quarterly top-to-top. I was with Janet, the Chairman of Deloitte last month, we have a half day top-to-top policy and Wilson from Accenture next week at Financial Analyst Day. And I think he'll even be a guest of honor there. And in each of these conversations then after KPMG IBM are -- some of are -- basically what they're saying is they see the same digital transformation opportunity need. They see ServiceNow as one of the fastest growing portions of their practice. And I think we've gotten significantly better over the past 12 to 18 months of basically calling on selling to and serving customers in a coordinated way with these GSIs. And that\u2019s actually healthy for customers, because in many cases to get full value out of the ServiceNow Platform, you need to reengineer your processes. It's one thing to lift in shift, historical processes and put it on the ServiceNow Platform, and you get some benefits of that, but the real power is when you take the time to also reengineer how you operate. That's how you get digital transformation to operate. And so our platform is increasingly at the epicenter of that, not just in IT but across many of the various products and services. And some of these GSIs, I'm talking with my -- yesterday they have platform GFC, right? They are building their own platform, of which ServiceNow is a core component along with some of the cloud providers and others. And so we sell both with the GSI directly to the customers where there's a direct ServiceNow instance. And in other situations, the customer is buying the platform if you will from the side of, which ServiceNow is a piece of it. Frankly we're indifferent; whatever allows the customer to get the best results. So they're a critical part, not just of our future but I think frankly a critical determinant about whether digital transformation actually transforms customers businesses and drive significant improvement and results. It's got to require us working closely with the GSIs. And I think they see that, we see that. And so they're stronger, focusing energy than ever on making sure that happens. I'm also delighted, I forgot if I mentioned this last quarter, we hired David Parsons to run our partner ecosystem. He's just a fabulous leader in this area. And so I'm really pleased with the progress that our teams are making in this area. Matt Hedberg : Well done. Thanks again guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Question for John and question for Mike. John, on the CSM side you mentioned legacy incumbent replacement. Could you talk through the competitive landscape there, what you're seeing given the success this quarter? How much is the big sales force in the market versus legacy and then some of the small emerging players in that space? Michael Scarpelli : Yeah. So most of the CSM deals that we're doing is we're not replacing modern technology, we're replacing legacy technology. And that could be a legacy Oracle implementation from the placebo implementation, may be there is a lot of remedy that was used out there as well for CSM or their own solution. And that's typically what we're seeing. There usually is modern technology competing at the table for the same business we're going after. It's really about our approach to CSM, why customers choose us, when they do choose us is because they like the fact that we are all about understanding root cause analysis within our system, lot more collaborative with people in the organization to resolve the problem, so you never see that it's doing. And that\u2019s just a very different approach to Customer Service Management from a CRM-centric approach. Michael Scarpelli : Walter, let me just build on that. CSM is clearly a huge segment, a huge market, $20 billion market. And I think way too many people think that somehow it's all the same and it's not. There are distinct segments in that market. And different providers align better with different segments. So as Mike said, we're not focused on going after the full $20 billion. There are certain segments of the CRM -- I'm sorry, the customer service market that require strong CRM-based system. We're not the best provider of that. Salesforce is the best provider of that. But there other segments that want to take inbound contacts, identify root cause, which is a cross-functional workflow, fix what the problem was, which again requires cross-functional coordination workflow, so that that problem doesn't happen in the future. And segments where you want the customer to do -- be able to address in a self-help or automated fashion, resolving their problem, understanding where it stands. And our platform is well geared for that segment of the market. And so, if you were to see where we focus on our go-to-market teams in CSM, it's not across the enter CSM market, it's against the sub-segment of the market where our product lines development leads, that tends to be B2B, technology company, services businesses and ones where there is, I would call, sophisticated customer needs to be served. And so, I think, this is not a zero-sum market, it's a $20 billion market. And as Mike said, there's a lot of old legacy software there. And so, I think, there will be multiple winners in this segment. Walter Pritchard : And then, Mike, on the upfront business, you had a strong quarter there with the Fed. How should we think about what you're expecting as we move throughout the year? It seems like that was light in Q4, and then it was stronger this quarter. Any way for us to get an expectation there for the year, thinking about how it will vary quarter-to-quarter? Michael Scarpelli : Unfortunately, it depends upon the new business that's happening. Renewal business, we know, for instance, I know in Q2 there's a pretty big renewal that will take place that's on-prem. We did suspect that this business was going to happen in the quarter, but we kind of hedged that a little bit, because I just don't know if it doesn't come in. It was really driven by the federal government, a chapter of our federal government, roughly 50% of our federal business is self-help, because they can't be in a public data center and that would consider ours to be a public data center, even our fed ramp data center they're not comfortable being in, because of the security they require. And so it's hard to forecast. I will say it is about 7%, 6% to 7% of our revenue for the full year is associated with self-hosted deals. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is open. Rakesh Kumar : Hi. Thanks. This is Rakesh Kumar sitting in for Jen Lowe. I wanted to talk about this Adobe partnership that you discussed a couple of weeks ago. What does this specifically mean for ServiceNow? And what more can we expect in the future? John Donahoe : Well, Rakesh, this frankly came to Shantanu and my attention, based on our respective customer visits. It wasn't something -- even though he's a very good friend of mine, it wasn't something we thought of in isolation. We both came back from ongoing customer business we do and had a growing number of customers asking, hey, could you connect some of the ServiceNow Platform with some of the Adobe capabilities we had and Shantanu was hearing the same. And we're a big Adobe user yourself internally. So, we got our platform team and to a lesser extent our CSM team together with the Adobe team about how can we ensure that a shared customer that's using Adobe and ServiceNow, we make one plus one equals three, making it easier to use, getting more value and it's often about linking the data. It's -- Adobe provides tremendous marketing analytics and other data, our platform has a lot of data and if you're going to give a 360 view to the customer, you're going to get the kind of the actionability. Adobe generates the insights, we often are the system of action. And so linking them together is -- wherever possible making it making easier for customers to get value, sort of, with the spirit. And so Shantanu announced at their customer conference -- feedback from our customers has been strong and our teams are excited about it. We think it also can offer some incremental opportunity for each company. Rakesh Kumar : Great. And then I have one more. You talked about adding two new data centers in Japan. Does that potentially accelerate G2K penetration in that region? Michael Scarpelli : Well, the whole reason we're building those data centers because we think it's going to drive business and there are a lot of G2Ks in Japan specifically. And based upon our feedback to get into some of those larger entities, they require data centers to be in Japan because of the data sovereignty requirements. So yes. Rakesh Kumar : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Sanjit Singh : Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss and congrats on a nice start to the year. I have two questions and maybe we can start-off with a question on Madrid. John you mentioned the about 600 new features with this release. And I think he highlight was sort of the mobile application making it easier to build application on top of the platform. Do you see any of these new features or capabilities sort of force multipliers for some of your core products? Or does that sort fuel will growth in just the overall platform business? John Donahoe : Well, I'm very excited about mobile, right? In my prior life, I had a chance to have a front row seat in the consumer mobile revolution and got to see first-hand how borne on the cloud application like an eBay, like a PayPal, like Amazon, a Lyft have completely transformed our lives at home by taking what complex and personalized and making it simple, easy, and intuitive. That's now going to happen in the enterprise. And with Madrid, was the first time we've launched in essence the re-platform SkyGiraffe, native mobile capabilities in the ServiceNow Platform. And Madrid started with the fulfiller experience. And so I see some nice pick-up by our customers who are excited about that. New York which comes this summer has the employee experience. And so you'll hear us talking at Knowledge about how the mobile employee onboarding capability that's true enterprise-wide onboarding that we're using it internally now at ServiceNow and it's awesome. And then secondly, what I would call, shared services portal back in the mobile lab. I think you're seeing the most progressive companies realizing that employees don't care if they have an IT problem and HR problem, a facilities problem, a legal problem, finance problem they just want if their problem addressed, they just want if their questions answered. And so if you're going to get people to migrate from change their behavior from picking up the phone and calling to go in one place to get their questions answered and their problems addressed that must be a shared services portal internally branded, right? So we see that. We have that as a web product today. In New York, there will be I think just killer mobile app that will be out-of-the-box, low code, no code requirement for the customer, branded in the customers name where they can then allow their employees to go one place to get their issues resolved. And so well that lead to acceleration, you called an acceleration of ITSM and HR case management some of the other product side. I think it will be and certainly been enhancer and we hope an accelerator and it is. You see more and more company taking a shared services mindset to driving to create an employee experience and I think mobile -- I think mobile be an accelerator of that. Sanjit Singh : That makes a ton of sense. Looking forward to hearing more at the Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. My second question was sort of our around sales and with so many big opportunities ahead of the company whether it's ITOM or CSM or HR from a sales perspective were there any changes made this year to -- moving to a more specialized sales force? Or do you really feel that the current sales force can go -- can go to a customer's who are selling it -- selling the entire platform whatever use case the customer maybe interest in? John Donahoe : Well, I think the biggest change is, I don't know, if you classically call it sales, but it's the other parts of the full go-to-market motion, which includes post-sales coverage. So I mentioned in my remarks that, we had -- we met with 10 to 15 of the top CIOs in the world in our CEO Advisory Council. And one of the things our best and largest customers are looking for is dedicated ServiceNow resources, who are solutions architects, who are onsite helping them ensure that they are architecting their implementation of ServiceNow to get maximum value from the platform and advising them how to extend the platform. And so as we think about, if we think about our entire go-to-market motion, it's not just the classic pre sales discipline and accounting tech as the solutions consultants product line specialist, but we also now solutions architects who are also often part of our professional services organization, who are training in certification and our partner ecosystem I referred to earlier is that whole combination of capabilities that allows us to deliver that kind of end-to-end customer coverage that allows us to expand those customer relationships, the way Mike described earlier in a healthy manner. And in our case, we're quite fortunate that all of that reports to Dave Schneider. And so Dave is architecting right from the very beginning, a seamless experience where when we both sell to a customer initially, and then serve them and expand our relationship and help deliver real value to them over time, we're doing that bringing the full breadth of our capabilities to bear that full end-to-end we call it go-to-market experience and includes customer success, solutions architects and coordinating with our partners. And so in that sense, yes our sales motion is evolving and Dave\u2019s doing a great job and the team as I mentioned Dave Parsons, Jimmy Fitzgerald, Cat Lang who are on the post-sales coverage areas, coordinating along with Kevin Haverty and really strong pre-sales team we have and is now increasingly -- we don\u2019t need to talk about pre-sales, post-sales, we\u2019re just talking about customer coverage. Sanjit Singh : Got it. I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about traction for the add-on products outside of the U.S. or maybe if you could give us a little bit more color around whether you're seeing more traction for CSM and HR Service Delivery in the U.S. or outside of the U.S.? And within the New York products what's having more success with your international customers? John Donahoe : We're really not seeing any difference from a customer adoption of the emerging or platform. It's pretty much the same profile in the U.S., in EMEA and APJ. At the end of the day these tend to be global, large enterprises that all have the same problems. So, I'm not seeing any noticeable difference. Yes one quarter you may have because there's big deals in CSM or HR or may be stronger in one regional than other, when you look at it over a year there's really no difference that I've been able to see. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up. The ITSM pro SKU, I believe that\u2019s priced quite higher than the core SKU. I'm curious if that's having an impact on the size of new deals? And as existing customers come up for renewal, maybe you could comment on whether they're upgrading to the higher dollars if that's driving a positive impact on getting them to adopt additional products rather than eating up price increase? So, maybe it will be helpful if you could just walk us through that as well? Thanks. Michael Scarpelli : Yeah. So I can say the pro bundle was really a way to monetize the investments we've made in artificial intelligence in machine learning. And we have definitely seen an uptick in that pricing has been able to keep our pricing higher on customers who are likely to do that with new customers, and w are seeing success on renewals with customers, but it's still very early. Remember our renewals take over a number of years, typically a customer signed three-year contract. And I think it's going to take a little bit more time to see what the uptick is with our installed base of customers, but it's definitely getting traction with new logos. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks for taking my questions today. Congrats on the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks. John, given the brand marketing you've invested in over the last few months. I know you mentioned its increased awareness with the C level executives. What I'm curious has this already helped in the field surface new conversations and engagement at the C-level? And I guess if we were to fast forward a year or two from now is one of the hopes that it drives more executives to be buyers of ServiceNow? Or how do you think it could help transform high level engagements? John Donahoe : Yes, Derrick. I think it's too early to point out that direct cause and effect. But I can tell you for instance as I engage with C-Suite execs either as customers or just more generally the number of people have said, hey I saw that ServiceNow ad, boy, that was funny, that was great which is exactly what the point was. Alan Marks who is sitting here next to me is our Chief Brand Creative Officer and was the real architect behind these commercials. And again here's the simple -- the way I think about it and I think Mike and I would think similarly about this. A year from now when a CIO or CIO and CHRO are bringing to our CFO a $10 million contract for ServiceNow, we want that CFO to say we offer to ServiceNow. And so there's just a general awareness as being one of the top strategic platforms that we're trying to build. Whether that lead to new leads across the C-Suite? I don't know. Frankly, that's not the direct goal because the new leads come from more direct selling activities. This provides kind of the air cover, legitimacy, and brand building that establishes us as a leading innovative, very human with maybe a little sense of humor company. I also think frankly the value as much with -- on the employee brand side. Talent is the lifeblood of any technology company and we are growing rapidly and growing globally rapidly. And so it matters if students on the top universities prefer to ServiceNow, it matters if someone in a local market can say go home to their parents -- the older proverbial mother I'm joining ServiceNow and have his or her mother have heard of ServiceNow. You may laugh about, but that kind of stuff matters as you're kind of scaling in the way we are and we are absolutely focusing and attracting and retaining top talent. And so the global brand building is also part of that, C-Suite executives and talent. So, good start. We're going to get the data in on aided, non-aided awareness which I'm sure has increased and we'll continue to invest to build that over time. Derrick Wood : Got it. Thanks. I was hoping to touch on the SecOps product, it doesn't seem to get as much attention a CSM or HR. But can you talk about how you see the opportunity shaping up over the next 12 to 18 months? And maybe what you can do to help drive more penetration in the security budget? John Donahoe : Well, I mean I think interestingly one of the things that we've done is by bundling our products into the three workflows and SecOps in the IT workflow, I think that's a little bit more symptomatic or emblematic and aligned with how the decision-making often happens because where we thrive is when a CSO and a CIO are both jointly involved in the -- our products decision. We do vulnerability response, incident response and so as part of I think a healthy and natural ServiceNow bundle if you will, ServiceNow suite of solutions. I'll also say I mentioned earlier I was with Mike Lawrie, his team from DXC yesterday and they had some very interesting security offerings that they were saying that they believe ServiceNow can be a really important component to it. So, I think partnerships like -- with people like DXC, with people like Accenture, Deloitte, the KPMG can also accelerate that part of our business as we are offering the full security solution. We have an important component of it with our security -- our incident respond, our vulnerability response and to some extent our GRC capabilities. Derrick Wood : All right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits : Hey Mike and John. I just want to talk about the mid-market and commercial market. Who are you seeing competitively down there? And are you adjusting your go-to-market in any way? Michael Scarpelli : We tend to see in a lower market that's where you hear more of the -- with their service desks that's going to send us, can you have Freshworks spend the same people that we've seen there for a number of years, but it's a very small piece of our business. As you know, we tend to focus more on enterprise the commercial segment now was around 20% of our business and even of that that's really the high-end commercial. It's typically the 3,000 to 5,000 employees we focus on. And it's still very much is a direct selling model. We are trying to do more through the channel that at the end of day when you have customer data they want to have a direct relationship with you. So channel partners are more involved in that segment, but we still have direct contracting relationships with those customers. And I've got to say there's really been no change in that market for the last five or six years that I've seen. But the one exception, I would say is we used to hear more of Cherwell. We don't hear of Cherwell nearly as much as we used to in that segment. John Donahoe : And Michael, just building on Mike said my observation would be one we have a terrific leader there John Sapone and he's got a really, really strong team, a talented commercial sales team. But what you see is that there are certain businesses that are in that we define commercial as 1,000 to 5,000 people that are high growth and are on their way to becoming an enterprise. And almost inevitably, the larger you get, the more you want a platform and the more you want to scale platform like ServiceNow and that's really where we're strongest. Someone is going to say, right 1,000 employees and be there three to five years now. They have to make a fundamental decision, do they want to go with one of the companies Mike mentioned earlier or do they want to go to ServiceNow. But where we really like about our position is those companies in that market are growing understand that they need to once you get to a certain size you have to have the kind of fundamental platform that we offer. And so John and his team do a nice job of segmenting that market ensuring they're focusing their energies on where customers have a real driven need for what we deliver and offer. As Mike said -- Michael Turits : Thanks guys. Thank you. Oh sorry. John Donahoe : Okay. Michael Turits : Thanks very much guys. Really appreciate it. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, everyone. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as the webcast in the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2019 ServiceNow Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Michael Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer you may begin your conference. Michael Scarpelli : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is John Donahoe, our President and Chief Executive Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2019. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

I would now like to turn the call over to John. John Donahoe : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. We delivered another strong quarter continuing our focus on driving customer success and enabling digital transformation as a strategic partner to the world\u2019s largest enterprises. We make work, work better for people, that\u2019s our purpose. People want technology to make their life at work simple, easy and convenient, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened over the past decade in our lives at home. Cloud-based consumer apps and platforms have made their routine task of everyday life at home more simply the inconvenient, and now the same things happening at work. Digital transformation has become an essential business imperative for companies and governments all over the world, and C-Suite leaders are embracing cloud-based platforms as a critical component of their digital transformation strategies. That is creating an exciting moment, an inflection point where ServiceNow is well positioned to help make life at work more or like our lives at home, simple, easy and convenient. I\u2019ll take more about this in a minute. But first, let\u2019s take a look at the highlights in the quarter. In the second quarter, we closed 39 deals with ACV greater than $1 million. We now have 766 customers doing more than $1 million in business with us annually, which represents 33% growth year-over-year, and a renewal rate for the quarter continue to be strong at 98%. Our Q2 results continue to demonstrate our strong product portfolio, 17 of our top 20 deals involved three or more products. And we landed several large deals in the financial services, technology and automotive industry that involved multiple IT products. In fact, we signed one of our largest new customer deals ever with a major financial institution, which purchased most of our IT portfolio. We also had significant wins in CSM with three deals over $1 million. Our customer workflow products enhanced customer operations management. We help customers manage better their inbound contacts, identifying the root causes of customer issues, working to fix those issues to prevent future problems and automating self-help solutions that creates great experiences and better outcomes. Our Knowledge 2019 customer event in May was our biggest ever, and product innovation took center stage, which brings me back to the inflection point, I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. Our Chief Product Officer, CJ Desai and his global product team continue to do an incredible job delivering product innovations to make work, work better for people. And that was evident at Knowledge, as we unveiled native mobile capabilities rolling out in our upcoming New York release. I\u2019m personally very excited about our Now Mobile and mobile onboarding capabilities. We are delivering easy intuitive out of the box mobile capabilities that enable consumer like experiences across the enterprise, making like at work, more like lives at home. These are the kinds of experiences that employees expect and demand today. Now Mobile is designed to easily help employees get work done, solve problems and search for information on the go, and are Now Mobile Onboarding app is purpose built to do one thing very well, make it simple and easy for a new employee to get up to speed fast and get productive quickly. Mobile technology was at the epicenter of the digital transformation in our lives at home, and we believe mobile technology will be at the very center of great experiences at work. Our recently announced partnership with Microsoft illustrates our focus on accelerating digital transformation for enterprise and government customers. This partnership will enable us to more fully leverage and integrate our platform and products with Microsoft\u2019s leading enterprise technology and capabilities. And using Microsoft Azure for workloads in highly regulated industries will help accelerate digital transformation for enterprise and public sector customers. With ServiceNow available through Azure government, U.S. government agencies will be able to leverage the compliance coverage across regulatory standards available through Azure. The U.S. federal government continues to look to ServiceNow as an important strategic partner as it modernizes its IT infrastructure and accelerates the use of modern technology to digitally transform how they operate. We\u2019ll also be partnering with Microsoft in Australia followed by additional markets in the future. The Microsoft partnership is just one example of how we are enhancing our alliances and partner ecosystem. For example, we also announced in the quarter a strategic agreement with Deloitte. Deloitte and ServiceNow planned jointly develop, coordinate and bring the market new products, assets and solutions built on the Now Platform. This will help deliver seamless digital experiences across the enterprise, improve workflows and enhance productivity. Deloitte will also serve as the lead launch partner for a new financial operations management product, which we announced at Knowledge in May. Our first application is Finance Close Automation, a natural extension of ServiceNows\u2019 workflows and platform capabilities. Finance Close Automation will help finance and accounting teams digitize their workflows to reduce finance close risk, improve team satisfaction and accelerate the finance close process. At Knowledge, we also announced a number of enhancements to our partner strategy. This includes more intuitive segmentation of our global partner portfolio, better differentiating levels of expertise for our partners and customers. We\u2019re also implementing a more consistent, proactive and predictable joint go-to-market engagement framework with our partners. Following Knowledge, we held a very successful partner executive summit in early June with 16 of our top global partners. The shared energy and enthusiasm for the opportunities we have to jointly serve our customers was infectious. Creating a robust partner ecosystem is a priority for us and we\u2019re off to a great start. David Parsons, who joined us last year is doing a terrific job of leading this effort. Before closing, I want to take a moment to express my deep thanks and appreciation to Mike. As previously announced, Mike is leaving ServiceNow in August. Mike has been with ServiceNow for eight years and most of you have gotten to know Mike very well during that time. And anyone who has worked with Mike knows what an exceptional CFO and customer focused leader he has been for our company. Mike joined ServiceNow in 2011, when the company had only 400 employees and was roughly $100 million in revenue. He helped take ServiceNow public in 2012 and has helped create the very foundation for our success. Mike has made many ServiceNow friends over the years, and we will definitely miss him. Personally, I am deeply appreciative for Mike\u2019s partnership over the past 2.5 years. He\u2019s been instrumental in our continued success and has helped set the stage for a next phase of growth. We have an active search underway for Mike successor. And Mike\u2019s size 16 feet means his successor has big shoes to fill, literally and figuratively. But in all seriousness, there is strong interest in the role and we will move as quickly as possible to land the right candidate. Meanwhile Mike leads a great finance team in place. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our continued progress in our focus and commitment on our customers and our teams. It was gratifying to see our momentum recognized during the quarter, when Gartner gave us a positive vendor rating in its first ever review of our full company strategy and vision. We\u2019re committed to making the world of work, work better for people, and we\u2019re focused on building deep customer relationships to enable their digital transformations. Technology should make life at work as easy as our lives at home. That\u2019s the future of work and we intend to help make it happen. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you, John. I appreciate those kind words. Now let\u2019s dive into the highlights from the quarter. Subscription revenues for the first quarter were $781 million, representing 36% year-over-year adjusted growth including $17 million of foreign exchange headwind. Our subscription revenues were negatively impacted by a few self-hosted renewals shifting from Q2 to Q3. The largest of which was a federal customer we\u2019re working with to consolidate contracts and expand their customer relationship with us in Q3. While the nature of early and late renewals were similar in Q2 versus previous quarters. The late renewals in Q2 are self-hosted contracts, which pushed more upfront revenue recognition into Q3, we are on track to close these contracts in Q3. Subscription billings were $817 million representing 34% year-over-year adjusted growth including $17 million of foreign exchange headwind and a $6 million duration tailwind respectively. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO ended the second quarter at approximately $5.4 billion representing 36% year-over-year adjusted growth, including $53 million of foreign exchange headwind. Current RPO, which represents RPO that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was approximately $2.7 billion representing 37% year-over-year adjusted growth, including $26 million of foreign exchange headwind. Moving out to profitability, our Q2 operating margin was 18% driven by a shift of expenses that will be realized in Q3, and our free cash flow margin was 23%. With talent being a top company priority, we continue to invest in our people and attract top talent, we successfully on-boarded a record 700 plus net new employees in Q2. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2019. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $830 million and $835 million representing 33% to 34% year-over-year adjusted growth including approximately $6 million of foreign exchange headwind. We expect subscription billings between $848 million and $853 million representing 27% to 28% year-over-year adjusted growth including approximately $6 million and $3 million of foreign exchange and duration headwind respectively. As a reminder, we expect billings to continue to become seasonally stronger in Q4, as it is our largest new bookings in renewals quarter each year. We expect a 23% operating margin and 195 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We are raising our full year 2019 subscription revenue guidance to between $3.245 billion and $3.255 billion representing 36% year-over-year adjusted growth, including approximately $44 million of foreign exchange headwind. We are also raising our full year 2019 subscription billings guidance to between $3.74 billion and $3.75 billion representing 32% year-over-year adjusted growth, including approximately $47 million and $17 million of foreign exchange and duration headwind respectively. We are maintaining full-year 2019 margin guidance as follows. Subscription gross margins of 86%, operating margin of 21% and free cash flow margin of 28%. For the year, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 194 million. Before we get to your questions, I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m extremely proud of everything ServiceNow is accomplished over the last eight years, especially the finance team that we have built. During the interim period, before a new CFO joins ServiceNow, Fay Sien Goon, our Chief Accounting Officer, will assume the internal role of leading the finance organization; and Lisa Banks, our VP of Investor Relations and Treasury will be your primary contact along with the support of Dominic Phillips, our VP of FP&A and corporate development, we\u2019ve all got to know over the last five years. It has been a pleasure working with so many great people at the company and all of you on this call. I\u2019m very confident ServiceNow will achieve its long-term aspiration of $10 billion in revenue. With that operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. First, I just want to start by Mike \u2013 saying Mike it\u2019s been great getting to know you over these past few years since the IPO. And we look forward to bugging you at Snowflake shortly. So, thanks for all of your insights and we look forward to continuing the dialogue in your next role. Michael Scarpelli : Thank you. Jennifer Lowe : And on that note \u2013 I have a question on billings. Looking at the contracts that pushed out of Q2 into Q3, you mentioned revenue, but presumably that would have impacted billings as well. So, first is that correct. And then secondly, in the context of the broader billings guide, it looks like the full year increase was less than what we saw Q2 beat by, so sort of implicitly a guide down for H2 shouldn\u2019t that push out potentially be an offset to that, I just wanted to understand moving pieces are a little better? Michael Scarpelli : No. So your first question is, yes, those renewals that got pushed did negatively impact billings as well actually more than revenue, but that\u2019s purely timing and that was already reflected in our billing guide for the full year as well remember there\u2019s a number of things that go into billings, a big piece of billings is renewal. There were early renewals that happening Q2 as well too, which took from Q3, which really had no impact on the full year billings, because they were already being forecast in Q3, which got pulled into Q2. And as I said in my calls the normal push-outs and pull-ins of renewals was normal. The only difference was this quarter, a lot of the ones they\u2019ve got pushed were self-hosted and it was principally with some of the government deals that we have. Jennifer Lowe : Okay. Great. And you\u2019d also mentioned that this was a record onboarding quarter, there was more than 700 employees added in Q2. And if I look at sort of the disclosures by \u2013 of headcount by role, it will take sales and marketing gross kind of accelerated in Q2 versus the trend line that that we\u2019ve seen. So, I\u2019m just curious, what\u2019s going on there is it just normal fluctuations? Or is there a bit more of a push on the hiring front on sales or marketing and if so where are those heads going? Michael Scarpelli : So, we had a very much of focus push on sales and marketing. Two things we\u2019re focused on pipeline generation in the marketing organization business sales. As we\u2019re getting into bigger and bigger accounts, we need to split territories and reallocate accounts to reps, so we can adequately cover those big accounts and that\u2019s been part of our strategy for a while. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Hey, thanks guys. And I\u2019ll offer Mike congrats as well. It\u2019s been great working with you. John, you talked about the Azure partnership in your prepared remarks, which was super interesting. I guess, I\u2019m wondering if you played a bit more detail on that maybe how should we think about the partnership in terms of sort of a dual go-to-market strategy between the two companies. John Donahoe : Well, Matt, this is actually started in some ways last year, when we announced an intent to work with Microsoft with particular focus on the federal business \u2013 U.S. federal business. And what that really led to was the realization that we could take advantage of the highest security clearance that Azure has in the federal business. There are certain data sovereignty and other security requirements we have what\u2019s called IL-5 or FedRAMP High, which has enabled us to build a tremendous federal business. Microsoft has the absolute highest security clearance IL-6. And so, we just determined that it would have made sense to sort of us building that data center capacity for that market as well as for few other federal markets \u2013 for federal government markets that we take advantage of Azure and as part of that. So that we\u2019re taking that into their capability and then that\u2019s led to a broader conversation around how we can work together and combined our go-to-market efforts. Our product lines are very complementary with each other. In fact, we have over 20 integrations with Microsoft products that\u2019s the largest of any partner, customers really look to us to work seamlessly together. And so, we\u2019re coming together to try to make it easier for customers and easier for our go-to-market teams to support each other both in the federal market, but also, we think over time in the general marketplace. So, we\u2019re excited about the partnership. Matt Hedberg : And then maybe just as a follow-up, and it sort of related. I guess, Mike, you call out some of the self-help federal deals in the quarter, it\u2019s helpful to kind of think about the linearity here. But staying on the federal side, obviously it\u2019s a huge opportunity it seems like Microsoft could be a multiyear catalyst maybe more next year in the year after. But could you talk about the federal opportunity just overall into what is a seasonally strong government quarter? Michael Scarpelli : We expect Q3 will be a very strong federal quarter for us. But I can\u2019t stress enough, it\u2019s not just the U.S. federal government. We\u2019re doing business with governments around the world and that\u2019s a key part of that Azure strategy, a number of those governments around the world have data sovereignty requirements, so we don\u2019t have data centers. And that\u2019s the other thing that we\u2019re going to leverage out of Azure as well. Matt Hedberg : All right. Thanks for that. John Donahoe : And I misspoke, we have IL-4, an IL-4. Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Christopher Merwin : I appreciate you taking my questions. I want to start actually asking about ITSM Pro, and anything you can say about where you are with renewals for that? We saw ITSM revenue step up in the Q2 in terms of new ACV. I\u2019m just curious at what percentage of your customers have gone through this renewal cycle? And then maybe what uptake you\u2019ve seen so far there? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Remember, we just introduced ITSM Pro in the last kind of \u2013 it was in Q4 when we really came out with that. On average, we sell a three-year contract. So, we\u2019re still very much in the early innings of the renewal cycle with our customers on that, but the uptick has been very good and we expect that will continue. Christopher Merwin : Okay. Maybe one quick follow-up on ITOM. I think, for new deals we saw customers taking a lot more ITOM this quarter relative to last. But in Q1, we saw that growth rate decelerates. Just curious, we should think about that picking up again in light of what we saw with new ACV? Michael Scarpelli : So, as we said quite often as the ITOM deals tend to be big and lumpy. Yes, Q2 was a very strong ITOM quarter. And we do think with a lot of the investments we\u2019ve been making in ITOM that will continue, but you will see some lumpiness there given the deal sizes. Christopher Merwin : Okay. Thank you. John Donahoe : I maybe just build on that just for a second, Chris, what I think, we\u2019re beginning to see more and more is conversations with customers that\u2019s not IT product by product by product, but rather it\u2019s our IT suite or our IT portfolio. And the conversations going how do we help them go from legacy IT to modern IT. And so, you see more and more deals that have elements across our IT portfolio. Christopher Merwin : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Thank you. Question for John, and then a question for Mike. John, first on your end with the CFO transition here, I think, we\u2019re all thinking one thing that the company\u2019s benefited a lot from the transparency and financial disclosure and things like the slide deck given us lot of data here. I\u2019m wondering as you go through the CFO search, how important is it to get someone that wants to maintain that level of transparency? And how do you think about that in terms of the way you manage the business? John Donahoe : Well, I think the top priority is to find a CFO that wants to hide everything. Walter, Mike is a great CFO, because he is very transparent. In my prior life, Bob Swan was a great CFO, because he was very transparent and shared data in a very consistent way. And so clearly that\u2019s going to be a \u2013 I always consider that table stakes for a modern CFO and for the kind of people, we\u2019re looking for. And so that I would call is kind of core capability. And then, we\u2019re also looking for \u2013 and I\u2019m also looking for someone that does, some of the other things Mike does, that maybe you don\u2019t see. Mike is a very customer focused CFO; Mike is always talking to customers. He loves being with customers. And I think that\u2019s really important in this business. You can\u2019t be a CFO that just sits in the office. You got to be out there with customers. Michael Scarpelli : The other thing I want to add to that too, Walter is you have to remember, there\u2019s a team of people behind me that gives that transparency, and I don\u2019t see any changes in those people. Therein, we will continue. I expect the company will continue with that same level of transparency. John Donahoe : Well, they are sitting right around the table. And they make you look good Mike, right. They make you and me both look good. Let me just add one more thing that we\u2019re looking for, Walter that Mike does \u2013 it is Mike partners with our senior team to help both coach and mentor them, and help accelerate decision-making and help accelerate decisions. And so, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to get \u2013 Mike\u2019s been an outstanding CFO, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to get a \u2013 no one will replace his 16 feet shoe, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get a strong successor. And we\u2019re going to take our time to make sure it\u2019s a good one and as Mike said between Lisa and Dom and Fay Sien, so that in the entire financing, we have a very strong team that will continue the high level performance in the interim. Walter Pritchard : Got it. Great. Thanks for the transparent answer to that. And then on, I guess for Mike, as we look at billings in Q3, I think one thing your businesses has played out a little bit different from a seasonal perspective this year than in past years and I think last few years, you\u2019ve had a stronger uptick from Q2 to Q3 in terms of billings. I\u2019m wondering, if you could walk us through how this year is different, and especially what you\u2019re thinking about in terms of the strength in the federal business in Q3 given how strong that was the driver last year? Michael Scarpelli : So, first of all, I think the federal business will be extremely strong for us. You have to remember, I think a lot of those Federal deals will actually have October 1 start date, that will have no impact on your billings, because those signed contracts that will start in the next fiscal year, which is October 1 that federal gross down that we\u2019ve talked to you about in the past. And what I would say to is, I think people need to start really focusing on RPO, and especially when you look at our current RPO growth rate of 37% year-over-year. We\u2019re very happy with how that has grown. And I just think as we\u2019ve been talking about for well Q4, it\u2019s just becoming such a seasonally strong order for us, because many of our contracts that we signed during the year, they will sign shorter than one year to quote especially the upsell, it will turn to get an annual billing cycle and a lot of those billings actually happen on December 31, even though the initial deal may have happened throughout the year. Walter Pritchard : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : All right, great. Mike, few CFO\u2019s will be as sorely missed and I hope this is goodbye for now, but certainly not forever. So, let me ask you, Mike. As you are leaving, how do you feel about the state of the company? And what\u2019s been the most surprising change today versus eight years ago when you first joined? And I\u2019ll buy you a second there to think of an answer for that one. I will \u2013 I do have a follow-up for you as well John. Michael Scarpelli : I feel really good about the company, the way that it is set up from a product perspective, a go-to market. Obviously, we\u2019ll continue to evolve, but the company today is very different from when the company I joined in 2011. I have more people in my finance organization underneath me than the whole company had at that time. So clearly, there\u2019s been a lot of change. But I think with John coming on board, you got to remember the main purpose, John was brought on board over two years ago, was really to scale the company to that next level, and I think, he has been doing a great job. As we\u2019ve shown you, we just had record hiring. So, I feel very, very good about where I\u2019m leaving the company right now. And to the question before, you got to remember, I\u2019m leaving, because I want to go back to a small company and build from scratch. Sarah Hindlian : Thank you, Mike. A follow-up for you, John. I think one thing that stands out about ServiceNow is that you continue to be a single platform with a single code base and data model across all of your products where perhaps it would be fair to say that other scaled SaaS vendors have faltered. When I think about you and your ability to deliver ongoing product innovations to your customer base, how important is that single platform in code base? And how sustainable is it also? John Donahoe : Well, I think it\u2019s one of the clear strengths of our model and of our platform, when customers say that our platform is easy to build on, it\u2019s extensible, it\u2019s fast. That\u2019s because of the discipline the company\u2019s always had to make it one platform. Every time we do an acquisition of technology tuck-in, we rebuild it into the code whether that\u2019s machine learning or chatbot or other functionality. And I think that will continue to be the core of our core over time. And a lot of organic innovation will be off our core in our platform, but I also think over time, this is not a religion. And so, I could see on our path to $10 billion, we may do an acquisition or even a couple that would add a complementary platform. Nothing specific in mind, I\u2019m making a more general statement, but it\u2019s, and then we just want to make sure that the two platforms can connect interchangeably. So, it won\u2019t be an impediment from continuing to build and scale our organization, and I will tell you customers say to us that they are \u2013 it\u2019s not infrequent they say, hey, well, we\u2019d really love it if you guys are also supporting us in this area. And often that would be with a complementary platform. So, I think most of our organic growth will be on the current platform, but over time over a three, five year time horizon, we could \u2013 you could easily see us adding another platform or two through M&A in a very complementary way. Sarah Hindlian : That makes sense, great. Thank you so much, John. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thank you for taking the questions guys. And very nice quarter. I wanted to talk to you, kind of two elements that I think we\u2019re talking to a little bit less in just kind of recent periods, just to check in and see how they\u2019re doing. One being new customer growth, we see the metrics on sort of deal \u2013 sort of customers getting to that $1 million point. I just wanted to check in and see sort of how like the new customer pipeline is going and getting kind of new customers in the door for the broader platform, number one. Number two, just checking in on the commercial business doing really well, growing really big customers. What\u2019s the competitive environment, sort of the outlook like in the commercial business and how you guys been fairing on that side of the equation? Michael Scarpelli : So, the commercial business continues to do very well for us, but as we\u2019ve said many times, most of our revenue comes from the larger enterprise business. And so clearly, we put more resources and dollars in the enterprise, because it\u2019s 75% plus of our business, but the commercial is very key, especially that\u2019s where you tend to keep the competition out on the bottom end of the market from moving up into the enterprise. And then new customer adds, we continue every quarter to add customers. We\u2019re not disclosing customers on a quarterly basis. We \u2013 it was consistent with what we did last year, but we will disclose that annually. But as we said to, the bulk of our net new ACV in any quarter is coming from our existing installed base of customers. We generally land customers small, but then they quickly grow and you see that in a cohort analysis and there has been no change in that at all, those customers you can see we filed the presentation they continue to grow. And the second part of your question in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in competition. It\u2019s really no change down there. We continue to see, there is a [latsy] [ph], I know a lot of investors talk about [latsy] [ph] and they tend to be in the lower end of the market. Cherwell tends to be in the lower end of the market. They do try to get up into the smaller enterprise. But we \u2013 there\u2019s really been no change there. Obviously, that\u2019s in the core IT and the CSM is probably the most competitive market out there, but it\u2019s the biggest market opportunity out there for us. John Donahoe : And some of our most, I think, interesting early CSM wins were in commercial. You see, I mean, what\u2019s fascinating is or some smaller companies, they are driving their entire business off ServiceNow. So, it\u2019s also playing a role. Yes, it\u2019s participated in that market, but it also helps speed our innovation pipeline, because we get to see a COO of a 4,000 person organization drive a lot of their operations, the CSM employee experience and IT off the Now Platform. And so, I almost think there is a little bit of a product development through a product innovation input that we get out of the commercial business. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Great job on the quarter, guys. John Donahoe : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks. Last quarter, you guys mentioned a bit softer activity out of Europe, and I think in general, there are more investor questions about the macro and how it\u2019s impacting demand. So, I\u2019m just wondering, if you could shed some light on how you guys saw activity progressed from Q1 to Q2 in Europe? And how you\u2019re feeling about demand trends for the rest of the year? Michael Scarpelli : What I would say is, we had a very aggressive plan for the year and Europe was slightly behind its plan for the first half, but I kind of see it making up that in the second half. But overall as a company, we\u2019re kind of on track to where we need to be. I don\u2019t think, there is nothing that indicates that macro with the concern, when I\u2019m hearing that from our customers. I\u2019m not seeing it in terms of, usually when you have the macro concerns, customer start to slowdown on their payments to us and stuff, we\u2019re not seeing that at all in our cash flow. So, I\u2019m just not seeing it from my perspective in the business now. Derrick Wood : Okay. And John, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re working on building a new framework with your channel and with your partner engagement process. Can you just give us a little more detail around some of the changes in the mechanics that you\u2019re working on right now with your partners? John Donahoe : Well, Derrick, to be honest, it\u2019s to some of the blocking and tackling. But here\u2019s what\u2019s happening for our customer base and certainly to our largest customers. For them to get maximum value out of the ServiceNow platform, they need to reengineer their processes and redesign, and that\u2019s how you get the maximum impact of automating your processes, right automating workflows. And so, they are partnering with partners at customers is critically important. It\u2019s not just implementation work, it\u2019s often more value-added work around process redesign, change management, or culture change. And so, we\u2019re now being far more strategic in our segmentation of our partners, because we work with the very largest ones, the Accentures, the Deloittes, the KPMGs, the DXCs, the IBMs as well as the next year as well, and we\u2019re just doing fundamental blocking and tackling. Many of these partners say that we are the fastest growing practice in their organization. We are now Dave Parsons has brought this mindset of let\u2019s build billion dollar plans with our top partners? How do we get to $1 billion over the \u2013 $1 billion for them over the next three to four years and to enforce that, that\u2019s the focus with different partners on different industries, making sure that our go-to-market teams are aligned with their local go-to-market partners. And that systematic \u2013 and we\u2019re jointly innovating with them. So that systematic blocking and tackling, I can tell you is just even in the 2.5 years, I\u2019ve been here, we\u2019re more coordinated and I think it\u2019s more central to both us and them. I was on the phone this morning with the Vice Chair, Vice Chair of one of the Top 5, he\u2019s personally sponsoring the search Now relationship and alliance and partnership because he says, we view it as very strategic to our success and client success, and I said we feel the same way. And so, David Parsons and his alliance team as I said in my remarks just a nice job of allowing us to be more focused, more strategic and more disciplined on how we\u2019re going after it. We\u2019re also trying to grow new partners. One of the biggest issues we have is that there\u2019s a shortage of trained certified ServiceNow professional resources in the market. So, we\u2019ve been doing things like going to universities and trying to grow the number of the pool of trained and certified ServiceNow professionals but then enter these partners and serve our customers. So that\u2019s an important part of our success and I think over time we\u2019ll also get some go-to-market benefits as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Congrats as well. I\u2019ve got one question for John and a follow-up for Mike. John, can you maybe expand a bit about the record megadeal you sign in financial services this quarter? What was the evolution of that transaction? And how are you being deployed at this institution and maybe even if you could talk about the pipeline for such megadeal\u2019s in the future? John Donahoe : I think five years, Mike? Michael Scarpelli : It\u2019s [indiscernible] years. John Donahoe : And I mean that in a thoughtful way that in many cases what\u2019s beginning to happen is clients that are not yet customers, may be a remedy customers or others, they see when their renewals was going to be and they begin to reach out to us a year, two years sometimes three years before that\u2019s coming. So, we then worked with them so that when that major renewable point for them hits, they migrate over to ServiceNow and we\u2019re prepared to do so. And now that\u2019s the case here. I will say I was on our call with this organization\u2019s CIO and I think it was 300 to 400 of their organization and literally obligate this has been planned for 6 to 12 months, the deal was signed in the quarter and they are mobilizing for a major transformation based on ServiceNow. And so that literally within 30 days of the deal being signed, they\u2019re moving. And I think we\u2019re seeing that with more and more of our new customers we\u2019re entering in a more strategic way. It\u2019s often they\u2019re making investment in ServiceNow Platform not just a single product. And a lot of our free sale conversation is around implementation approach. It\u2019s not just, buy this great product, it\u2019s how can I be sure we\u2019re going to get the business value, how can ITapp ServiceNow best practices? How can I make sure we\u2019re working with your best third-party partners? But by the way, on this call, I talked about third party partners, it was us, the partner and the client all on same call, focus and outcomes that they wanted to achieve. And so, the conversations left around product, Product A to Product b, it\u2019s more on business outcome and business outcome be that they want to achieve. And that I think consistent with us becoming more of a strategic business partner with our customers, which I think is the only way you build sustainable growth you have to continue to innovate new products but the more customers are confident we deliver strong return on investment and help them achieve their business outcomes, the more sustainable our growth will be and the more pricing will hold up over time. Brad Zelnick : It\u2019s clearly working. And for Mike, Mike, as we retrain our sites to really hone in on RPO this quarter current RPO really strong up in adjusted 37%, I know it\u2019s not a metric that you\u2019re going to specifically guide us to quarterly, but how should we think about it going forward? Michael Scarpelli : Not going to guide it for the rest of the year. We\u2019re guiding billings for this year. I do expect that some companies have transitioned to RPO next year. That\u2019s something the new CFO along with the team, I would encourage to consider doing that. We thought about doing this year but we want to 1 year under our belt before we started doing that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Mike, all the best. Actually, can I stay on that topic because and since your last call may be ask more theoretical question. If I use current RPO to calculate bookings number and bookings were on that calculation 41% so even like really, really strong. Can you just kind of conceptually, I mean, that should be no cleaner number in CRE that\u2019s why we kind of on looking at that and at your scale grow 41% bookings is like a good number can you just kind of give us puts and takes there a little bit? Michael Scarpelli : Yes. Well, you got to remember a big chunk of that growth is the renewals we assigned possible and renal wells getting we mentioned to be before we crossover renewals number and an animal business bigger than new ACV from customers. So, I don\u2019t know what else to tell you, it is what it is very nicely and we did very closely to what you said that, that bookings growth. Raimo Lenschow : Maybe one follow-up you\u2019re going back to earlier conversation on Q4 getting bigger. So, it seems like it\u2019s the same kind of co terming we see on sales force et cetera work you first get bigger and you get blamed basically, every year like a compounding effect. Are you kind of thinking breaking that out at some point? With the team, when you\u2019re talking to the team? Michael Scarpelli : What do you break out? Raimo Lenschow : Like the compounding effect that we get there? Michael Scarpelli : Well, I\u2019m not going to be here. It\u2019s not company that but I think that\u2019s a good question for Lisa and the next CFO in December. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Thomas Roderick : Mike, I\u2019ll let the sentiments here and say congratulations on your next gig. It\u2019s been great working with you. So, a lot of the metrics in the presentation that I wanted to call out sort of follow-up and see if I get better looks like even despite the currency headwinds Europe was up a tick on a percentage of revenue basis. So, looks like Europe is accelerating on a reported basis even better than that on constant currency. Can you just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in EMEA and speak to whatever drivers behind the strength you are seeing there? John Donahoe : I\u2019ll step back because I think quarter-to-quarter is a little less in any given region like Q4 was really strong in Europe because got pulled in. Q1 as Mike said was a little better. I\u2019ve been in couple of times this year and the fundamentals are very consistent where large multinationals and there are a lot of great large multinationals across Europe are embracing cloud, and we are increasingly a strategic partner in those relationships. One of the markets that we\u2019re particularly focused on and excited about is Germany. Germany Was relative to other markets a little later in embracing cloud. German multinationals, the German government had more questions are around security of cloud, privacy of data and things. Now the German market is embracing cloud and rate and accelerating rate and so we think given the size of that market and still younger in that cloud adoption curve, it\u2019s a real opportunity and an area of investment opportunity for us. The German business at a very strong Q2 and we are going to continue to invest in Germany and we think it offers a large opportunity. So I would say there was nothing discontinuous and frankly, any of the quarters over the last 4 or 5 quarters with Europe is strong and strong demand and our job is to build high-quality relationships with the leading enterprise companies and as Mike said earlier, governments, we\u2019ve been having some of the European governments saying we want to do business with you but you got to have global data sovereignty or you got to have complied with local data regulations and that\u2019s where the Azure partnership potentially future partnerships like that will help us accelerate our ability to serve that part of the European business. Thomas Roderick : Outstanding. Really helpful. Then quick follow-up for you, sort of widely related to the topic of Germany. But the financial product very interesting insofar as it\u2019s a little bit more of a foray into the back-office and touching ERP than you really done before. Can you talk about some of the important partnerships and technology integrations that we have got to be thinking about with that product? And then who do you hope to compete more in that market for financial cost management? John Donahoe : Well, given that Mike\u2019s team that built it for our or financial close, how much as they relate to the integration that I can talk about in the partnership? Michael Scarpelli : Yes, so what I would say is we work with SAP and Oracle and the integrations and those are the two main ones that you have to be integrating. We actually closed our first, we got our first PO and I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s a very nicely size deal. We\u2019ve actually the largest first PO for alternate your business unit with them ServiceNow. And so that\u2019s just how do the potential of this. And in terms of who will compete, arguably I don\u2019t really want to get who cool we compete with right of the products more in the market out there but most of you know from conversations before, I don\u2019t really want to name names companies but it\u2019s not the ERP people, it\u2019s more around workflow associated with the financial close process. But in general, we\u2019re going after the white spaces being served in e-mail and Excel spreadsheets today is what we\u2019re doing to offer a much better visibility into the financial close process for the office of the CFO and then I\u2019ll let you by then. John Donahoe : It\u2019s been interesting, I\u2019ll just echo what Mike said, in our product strategy meetings the last couple of years Mike has continually said, there are a lot of finance processes that are highly manual but not of the ERP providers focus on, there\u2019s really no one else is focusing on and finance close the books classes my spreadsheet, e-mail and other things in our platform is very well suited to help addressing those. And so, this was the first of what I think will be several we hope over time. We\u2019re also very I think cognizant and humble that we\u2019re not going to do all internally go-to-market calling on the CFO. That\u2019s why partnering with Deloitte was our early partner, partnering with really the ERP providers, partnering with others and that we view this as a way to piggyback on others that are serving in that market and in many ways our product is up. I almost consider it a feature on top of their products. And we think there is a good opportunity there over time but we\u2019ll see, still early days. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Mike, I just want to circle back to billings. Apologize for that but just help me connect the dots. So, I think in the quarter the 8 17 in the presentation you outlined 12 million of outperformance but in the full year guide, 5 million of outperformance is responsible for the increase. You talked about the deal, the renewals shifting, which I would have thought would have benefited the second half. So, what\u2019s the puts and takes, how do we get from the outperformance of 12 million to just to 5 million of outperformance in the full year? Michael Scarpelli : Well, because most of renewals and that where the outperformance was early renewals that got pulled from Q3 or Q4 into Q2 and there were deals as I mentioned that got pushed from Q2 into Q3. That\u2019s all about one where those deals doing. By the way, sometimes we do deals with people we could bring early renewal in more than a year in advance. If a customer is doing a much bigger deal where they want to just review the whole contract and renew early on. So, each deal is very different but that\u2019s the way the math works. We\u2019re not \u2013 it\u2019s not going beyond that it\u2019s really only a $5 million impact that flows through for the year. That was the stuff that was not in there. That\u2019s what ACV should think about. Sterling Auty : All right, got it. And then just one follow-up. Acknowledge, there\u2019s the discussion of the vertical kind of a vertical strategy. Obviously, been so successful in government and then you kind of outlined some other verticals including the financial services that you\u2019re looking to go after, how much of that is going to be people-focused in terms of just the go-to-market strategy versus the development of vertical-specific products and to the extent that it is, the technology and product focus, where are we on that road map to roll out those other vertical industry solutions? John Donahoe : I mean, I\u2019d say, strongly, by and large, it is go-to-market than it is product. Fundamentally, I think one of the great strengths of our platform is it\u2019s largely horizontal. IT helped this is the same as in the bank as it is in the pharma company as it is in a as it is in a retailer and a lot of what we do is more consistent than different. Now the one place that there is product implications are around security, compliance and regulatory. And so, whether it\u2019s banking or health care or federal government, there we have to comply with industry-based regulations and standards. But the real value in our vertical motion is being able to speak the language of the industry and relay it what we do to business value in that industry. And so I think if you look at what we do in federal, our federal sales team, I spent a lot of time in D.C, our federal sales team speak the language of our customer and that really comes to whether it\u2019s calling in the military services or the veteran\u2019s administration, the agencies our teams speaks the language and that\u2019s a certain amount of credibility, financial services, our teams speaks the language of banks or insurance companies. And that gives greater sense of confidence and I think more targeted focus on the business value you heard to earlier. So, we\u2019ll continue to layer on thoughtfully, additional industry verticals, but it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t know, Mike, I said 80% go-to-market, 20% product? Michael Scarpelli : Correct. I think we\u2019re very much in the early innings on the product side. John Donahoe : Right. And [indiscernible] example that\u2019s one that\u2019s very interesting based on the moment. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. Samad Samana : Mike, if I look to the slide deck, it looks like the average contract term jumped quite a bit for new customers in the second quarter and that the average for renewals has also been moving up. I was wondering is there any particular that\u2019s driving this trend for the expansion deals and then the trend that happened for 2Q for new customers and then I have a follow-up to that? Michael Scarpelli : So, the new customer was really driven by that one record new financial institution that signed a long-term contract with us. That\u2019s what drove that. And the renewals as we\u2019ve been saying for, we\u2019re becoming more and more strategic with customers that hasn\u2019t really changed that much but people keep on renewing average more than two years. I would expect that in Q3, that new customer length will be shorter and the reason being is because of the federal government. Just want to remind you guys that the federal government typically do 1-year deals, they don\u2019t do multiyear deals. Samad Samana : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I\u2019m just going to ask how the average contract term, how we should think about maybe that onetime impact on the change in RPO in 2Q, and made adjusting for that, what the RPO growth will look like? Michael Scarpelli : So, first of all, that average term light really does not impact current RPO. That\u2019s really current RPO because that\u2019s the next 12 months. That\u2019s going to total RPO, the contract length would impact more. Samad Samana : Yes, so I was wondering if you give us the adjusted growth or prevent meaningful enough payback of the overall average? Michael Scarpelli : Well, I\u2019m only giving you the current RPO growth rate because I don\u2019t need to adjust its 12 months and 12 months. So, I haven\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t calculated that adjusted for the total RPO. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something we will do. Samad Samana : Congrats on the tenure and the next move. Michael Scarpelli : Okay, as a reminder, a replay of this call will be available at the webcast in the Investor Relations Section of our webcast. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lisa Banks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, madam. Lisa Banks : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ServiceNow's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are : John Donahoe, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bill McDermott, our incoming, President and Chief Executive Officer. During today's call, we will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the full year 2019. We'd like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues and remaining performance obligation. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, our investor presentation and for future -- and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which including a replay of today's call are posted at investors.servicenow.com. We may make forward-looking statements on this conference call, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the press release and risk factors in our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John Donahoe : Thanks, Lisa. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us in today's call. Given our announcement yesterday, here's how we're approaching our call today. First, I'll give a brief overview of Q3 results in our 2019 annual guidance. Second, I'll provide a little more insight of my decision to leave ServiceNow and accept an opportunity to lead a company that I have been associated with and admired for a very long time. And finally before taking questions. You'll hear from Bill who will provide a little more context and why he chose ServiceNow and the opportunities he sees ahead. So let's start first with our third quarter results, we delivered another strong quarter, continuing our focus on driving customer success. Subscription revenues were $835 million, representing 35% year-over-year adjusted growth. This exceeded the midpoint of our previous guidance by $9 million including the impact of FX. Subscription billings were 864 million representing 29% year-over-year adjusted growth, this exceeded the midpoint of our previous guidance by 10 million excluding the impacts of FX and duration. Our remaining performance obligations ended the third quarter at approximately $5.6 billion, representing 36% year-over-year adjusted growth. Current RPO was approximately $2.8 billion once again, representing 36% year-over-year adjusted growth. Our operating margin in Q3 was 26% driven by hiring linearity and a shift in expenses that will be realized in Q4 and our free cash flow margin was 14%. Now for a peek under the hood, we closed 46 deals in the third quarter with ACV greater than $1 million representing 84% year-over-year growth, and we know of more than 800 customers, doing more than $1 million in business with us annually, which represents 32% growth year-over-year, and our renewal rate for the quarter remained strong at 99%. Our IT portfolio continues to have strong momentum. This quarter we again saw 18 of our top 20 deals include three or more products. As you recall, we launched ITSM Pro late last fall and we're seeing strong traction. Customers are upgrading from ITSM to ITSM Pro, and we're landing new customers, who see the value and starting with ITSM Pro. Simply what's happening is customers who are pursuing digital transformation are investing in ServiceNow's full suite of IT products. They see the value of better together and have leveraging our entire product suite and unique platform. This is a clear trend. A leading company in financial services is one example, they enabled world-class IT, security and risk via automated workflows, natively on our single strategic platform that now platform. For HR business also had a strong quarter, and we closed one of our largest employee experience deals ever with a global distribution company. ServiceNow employee service delivery solutions hide the complexity across functional work, making it easy for employees to get the services they need. This is making work, work better for people. In Q3, our New York release became generally available, New York extends new desktop, and native mobile capabilities across the workplace at scale. This enables companies to make their employees lives at work as simple, easy and mobile friendly as their lives at home. The New York release Now Platform and gets more than 650 innovations across IT employee and customer workflows. As you know, I am personally very excited about the native out-of-the-box mobile capabilities. For the first time, we have created consumer grade mobile experiences for the enterprise. Removing friction in everyday work; employees can now easily financers and seamlessly get stuff done across IT, HR, facilities legal and other departments and they can do so from a modern mobile app powered by the Now Platform. As a reminder, you can download a demo of this great mobile app from the App Store. Mobile technology was at the epicenter of digital transformation and lives at home and we believe mobile technology be the very center of great experiences at work. Now, let me turn to full year 2019 guidance. As a reminder, for several years we've used a very consistent methodology to manage FX. We simply take FX rates on the last day of the quarter and use those rates for the subsequent quarter. So for example, the guidance we provided in our Q2 earnings call were based on FX rates as of June 30, 2019. Now during this quarter, those rates change, impacting our Q2 results and annual guidance, so the guidance on today's call is based on FX rates as of September 30, 2019. We provide complete transparency and the impact of FX in our Q3 results at 2019 annual guidance in the Investor Relations presentation. So for the full year 2019, we're carrying forward the $9 million in subscription revenue and a $10 million in subscription billings that exceed our previous midpoint guidance for the third quarter. So for the full year 2019, we expect subscription revenues between $3.240 billion and $3.245 billion representing 36% to 37% year-over-year adjusted growth. We expect subscription billings between $3.740 billion and $3.745 billion, representing 32% to 33% year-over-year adjusted growth. We're maintaining our full year 2019 margin guidance as follows. Subscription gross margins of 86%, operating margin of 21% and free cash flow margin of 28%. Now, before closing out our review of the quarter, let me just take a moment to update you on our CFO search. As you know, over the past several months, we've done a global search for a world-class CFO and I'm delighted to say we've narrowed that search to a small group of exceptional finalist candidates. Now obviously, because of our CEO succession, I slowed the final interviewing process to enable Bill to be able to pick his preferred candidate. And the good news is what Bill's doing now is meeting those candidates and he expects to name our next CFO shortly. Now I'd like to just take a couple of minutes to explain my decision. Let me just say upfront that I believe deeply in ServiceNow and I believe deeply in ServiceNow's opportunity. As I've said before, there is a clear cloud tailwind. This is a beautiful as Bill calls it clean strategic technology platform, customers are leaning in and want to partner with our platform and we have the ability to extend and expand across the enterprise. And I believe as much today as any time I've been here, we're very well positioned to get to $10 billion and move on our way to becoming a great enduring company. And to be honest, I fully intend to be part of that journey. However, our unique situation with what is a unique company for me has emerged. Some of you may know that I have a 20-year history with Nike. I met Phil Knight and Mark Parker 20 years ago. And over the last five years, I've had the privilege of serving on their Board. I deeply resonate with Nike's purpose. And as everyone at ServiceNow knows I regularly use them as the gold standard of what a great company looks like and I love sports. So when the Nike Board reach out to me to ask me to come to our next CEO I was a calling, I felt I had to pursue. But I will say it again, it is not in any way change my belief in ServiceNow and the opportunity ahead. And so the Board and I have spent the last couple of months trying to identify the best successor in the world for ServiceNow. And let me just review the criteria we use and think about it these are criteria that will enable us to get to $10 billion and beyond. We need to continue to elevate our relationships into the C-suite. We need to expand from IT across the enterprise. As a company, we need to continue to expand globally and build more industry relevance, as we expand the number of industries we serve. We need to expand our go-to-market function and scale our entire organization. And most importantly, ServiceNow needs an authentic leader who is purpose based, values driven and experienced. And I think you would share my enthusiasm and excitement that the Board and I have that Bill McDermott has agreed to join as our next CEO. I would tell you I have gotten to know Bill personally over the last three years. I consider him most excellent CEO that I've learned from and a good friend. So, with no further ado, Bill, let me turn it over to you to talk a little bit about your decision to join ServiceNow. Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much John and hello everyone. First and foremost, allow me to congratulate John Donahoe, a great friend and enormously successful CEO on his personal accomplishment to become the CEO of Nike, an iconic brand. No one is more deserving than you John. And it's an honor to follow in your footsteps. I made my decision to open the next chapter of my career with ServiceNow. Way of background, I was with SAP for 17 years. I was CEO for 10 years. In that 10-year time horizon, we moved the market cap from $39 billion to $163 billion. We either doubled or tripled or quadrupled revenue profits, the number of customers that we serve around the world. Our last count was in the order of 450,000 customers around 193 countries. I believe strongly that at this particular time rather than renew for another five years, it was proper to say 10 years is good principal and I passed at the time to two excellent leaders that are now co-CEOs of SAP and I'm very proud of them and I'm looking forward to their continued success of SAP, a really wonderful company, a great experience, and to my friends at SAP, thanks so much and we'll continue to do great job in the next couple of months. As it relates to ServiceNow, why ServiceNow? First and foremost, the culture of ServiceNow is truly special. As I think about John Donahoe and what he's been able to accomplish and the amazing legacy of Fred Luddy and how he has set the tempo for really humble and hungry employees serving customers in the absolute best way possible and this idea of making work, work better for people is so human and so necessary in today's enterprise where customers more and more are looking for a true partner that really deeply cares. With that to ServiceNow, John continued that proud tradition and it's an honor for me to be humble and hungry and truly honored by this opportunity. I will give it everything I have. I'd also like to thank Jeff Miller, the lead Director and the Board of Directors for their support. What a Board of Directors ServiceNow has as well. I met the management team, John was kind enough to have us over is home. I met each one of them. Also the VPs across the company and as John said, we're well on our way to closing the CFO search and I think you'll be very pleased with the outcome -- outstanding candidates indeed. Now, if I was in your shoes, what would I want to hear from Bill McDermott? I would want to hear Bill, what about this $10 billion path that John Donahoe and the ServiceNow management team have been discussing? Well, let me answer that very simply. I completely buy in, stand by it, and I'm looking forward to achieving it. What about all the commitments including the financial commitments of the company on the revenue as well as the margin expansion story? Are you in on that too? 100%. That the customer commitments and the bright future of ServiceNow could not possibly be more in focus for me. I have already sold houses, bought houses, enough land move from my family and I am and I am a 100% in, and I'm looking forward to doing things that have never been accomplished before, because I am doing it off of a base that is just truly incredible. So, we are going to set the standard and be the most admired business-software company in the world. And I am fired-up and I can't wait to get started. Thank you, John. John Donahoe : Great, Bill. Thank you. So let's just I need to say one more thing before we turn it over to questions. Bill and I want to be crystal clear. We get, it's Q4. We get, we want a strong end of the year. We are both fully committed to ensuring a high quality and smooth transition. I don't start my new role to mid-January, so I am committed to be fully accountable in this role at ServiceNow until Bill completes his transition at SAP and is fully in the job. So in the meantime, you can assure that both of us have a deeper sense of responsibility and accountability on behalf of our customers, partners and employees to ensure a smooth hand-off in a strong Q4. So with that, operator you can now open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : Okay. Great, thank you for taking my question. And John, thank you for all of your time and serviced. And Bill, I'm really looking forward to working with you. And by the way, I think we all really appreciate the depth of color you gave us around your decisions and your views on how important making in Q4 is. So thank you for that as well. One thing, I think would be really great to hear from you guys about is how you're feeling and thinking about the general global macro environment especially in light of some of the issues that are going on in Europe and I think it would be helpful for us to just hear how you feel about your positioning in the global economy overall and any color you can give us around what you're seeing out there outside of the really strong large deal activity? John Donahoe : Yes. Sarah. Thank you, and maybe what we'll do, Bill I'll get from this is kind of interesting your. I'll give him from ServiceNow perspective you've been out in the same markets from an SAP's perspective or maybe even broader. So Sarah, let me just tell you what I see. I was actually in Europe all last week, we had our Now it worked forum in the Amsterdam or we had 1,500 customers, we had two days later network forum in London, where we had I think it was close to 3,000 customers, highly engaged at several customer meeting several partner meetings. And I will tell you on the front lines, with customers and partners. I hear no conversation around macroeconomic. Frankly, I didn't even care about Brexit last week. What they want to talk about is digital transformation and how do they use technology to drive productivity and better user experience. And so I hear them leading in. So we can't predict, at least I can't predict, what macroeconomic outlook is, but we are very focused on ensuring that under any macroeconomic scenario. Number one in that investment queue is an investment in the ServiceNow platform, because it drives productivity, to drive user experience and it drives digital transformation. Bill, what are you seeing from an SAP standpoint? Bill McDermott : John, I see exactly the same thing as you're seeing and you're absolutely right. The tailwind behind digital transformation and the cloud in in particular is evident in strong companies. So if there was going to be any step back anywhere, it will be in commodity hardware players or commodity players in tech. The high value digital transformation companies they're adding real business value, will continue to prosper because without the digital transformation card, it's a little hard to compete and win in this digital economy. So if I look at the pipelines, they look strong and they look ever consistent which is why we strongly reiterated guidance today. Sarah Hindlian : Thank you both very much and -- so much, congratulations to you both on your moves. John Donahoe : Thank you very much. Thank you, Sarah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. And I have to add Sarahs congratulations wholeheartedly and looking forward to -- going to miss you, John. Looking forward to working with you, Bill. My question, may be is just around the strategic direction to the $10 billion target. Clearly you have an organic framework and an inorganic opportunity to accelerate that track. I'm curious if -- when you think about the inorganic component, as you think about broadening the buying centers within your -- and broadening the strategic proposition of ServiceNow continually. What's the right way for us to think about the direction, whether it's within IT or outside of IT? And then just as a follow-up. I wanted to ask around just sales execution in the EMEA region, there were -- we talked about some issues last quarter. I'm just wondering if there were any kind of follow-ups on that? John Donahoe : Bill -- I think it's appropriate for you to comment on the first. Bill McDermott : Sure. I mean I think first and foremost, Alex, you have a great organic growth storage here. The pristine nature of this platform and the revenue that this platform alone can begin to drive is a real growth story in and of itself. And then when you think about the solution set that ServiceNow has, there's plenty of room within the context of these solutions to grow them in different geographies; obviously, same account revenue growth as you get more and more customers to buy the complete solution set. And of course, putting an industry flavor to things will also be quite helpful. And that flavor can then be personalized to different buying centers and you can use different channels to get at that in the marketplace. So lots of room to grow organically. I really believe that I said this to John many times. I believe ServiceNow is in the privileged position of being a platform --of the platforms, because when you look at the business process and the workflow that goes on and enterprises today. Everybody has this deep need to get the data aggregated in a workflow that creates simplicity for the users. And the more we can reinvent business processes in the image of the actual users themselves, the more we can become the defining platform of the platform for the modern enterprise. So I think the organic growth story here is just amazing and it's only just begun. I would also say, I've learned a lot and I've seen a lot of different business models, and the company, I work for very hard, had a very different business model at ServiceNow. Now this is a pure play cloud and when you do a tuck-in, if that's necessary because it has extreme value to the customer. Then you would certainly make sure that its integrated beautifully into the Now Platform. So you make sure this stays very simple and extremely easy to use, so more and extensibility can be realized by the developer community, the customers themselves and our great engineers. One of the things that, I've been blown away by is just how strong the engineering talent and leadership business at ServiceNow. So when I see that kind of talent. I start to feel really strong about organic growth. And I do want to underscore the go-to-market machine is equally up to the task. This is an outstanding leadership team here. I'm really impressed. John Donahoe : And now I'll try just to add to that you asked about European specific. It's so funny because we have to remind ourselves every now and then. We have the challenge everyone else wants to have. Scaling 30% a year, while growing so you've got to scale and grow a go-to-market team that has a growing number of account reps, product line specialists, solution architects and consultants. But it's some industry overlay. And then you do it across multiple countries in Europe, and as I said, I was in Europe last week and that team is really, really coming together and humming. We have a new leader in the U.K. who quite strong, from the VMWare all across Europe. I think our team is really coming together. So we had a lot of changes in the first half of the year, just as we layered in, a lot of new people. But those teams are coming together and on several customer calls, those the teammates are working seamlessly on behalf of our customers. Alex Zukin : Thanks guys, that's awesome. Good luck in Q4 and looking forward to seeing you again soon. John Donahoe : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent, thanks so much. John congrats to you. It sounds like your next chapter aligns perfectly with your destiny. Many people work their entire lives and never get a chance for something like that. So I truly wish you the best. But as it relates to ServiceNow -- John Donahoe : Thanks, Brad. Brad Zelnick : You're quite welcome. As it relates to ServiceNow and you may see my question is a bit shortsighted, but it's a conversation I've been having with several investors. Just trying to get comparable with what's ahead of us. And we're now seeing significant changes with some strong leaders exiting, some really strong executives entering and what sounds like at least some mid-level folks being hired away or at a minimum distracted by all the excitement. And Bill, I appreciate your commentary earlier today and the kind of following that you have, but is there anything Bill perhaps that you've experienced in the past that can service a guide for the potential disruption that we might be disruption that we might be in for during this transition? And perhaps even and I know its early days you're not really even in the seat just yet, but how you're thinking about it relative to the company's own internal model as you look out to next year? John Donahoe : So Bill, why don't I, maybe just give a quick context because Brad, I think I think there have been a couple of things written recently. There are a little bit misleading. So it is actually true that Mike start probably delays. The only member of our senior leadership team, our overall attrition rate as a company is I think in all is an industry low and it is the same this year as it was last year. On sales leadership, we have had of our top 100 sales leaders, three have left. So yes, three sales leaders have left to go Snowflake. 97 have not and we have a strong deep sales bench and it was not the Head of North America. It was some are working, running our commercial business and another North American role. And so we have a strong team. There's not a lot of departures. By the way some are saying, all the others that joined Salt Lake, they all left ServiceNow well before 18 months ago. And so we are very focused as a lot of people are very excited here about the momentum, about the prospects and the opportunity. And so I think that's the starting point, and then Bill you can talk about scaling and adding to that. Bill McDermott : Sure, John. So I think the disruption is, obviously, very well in hand. Thank you, John. And regarding the internal models and the things that have been built here, they're doing things very well. I mean, when I look at the org chart or I look at the way the sales force is set up, or the way the channel management's strategy is done it's very good. The question becomes can we do more and can we make it even better? And the answer is of course. That's why I'm here, because I see a great opportunity. But I see innovation without disruption. I see a way that we can layer in some added focus to give the solutions a richer context around the buying centers or around the scientific methodology to deliver the value. So we can have even new hires, look like they've been on the job for a long time. But this is systemic. It's something that's been done before and we'll do it the ServiceNow way. But all-in-all, I am very, very pleased with everything I have seen from the management team and it's just about a continuous evolution. We do not need to disrupt this place. We do not need to revamp territory coverage. We do not need to break customer relationships. This is going to be very smooth transition. And John and I are very similar in terms of how we look at the world, the value set that we have, the way we treat people, the way we value customers, the way we think about running companies. So you're not going to see a big change here. You're going to see a continuous evolution of a great thing. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very much. And I am glad I ask the question very directly John. So, we can get the fact straight and Bill I have to imagine you've had your pick of the litter of just about any software company that you'd want to run and we see a phenomenal opportunity as well here at ServiceNow. So, thank you so much for the comments. John Donahoe : Brad, I just want to underscore how smart you are to say that. I look at quite a few different things in quite different sectors. This was by far the most interesting sighting opportunity of a lifetime. And so I'm glad to see we're on the same sheet of music and I look forward to being great friends going forward. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you, again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and I'll add my congrats to you both, pretty phenomenal opportunities for both of you. So best wishes John and Bill. Nice to see you. Again, I guess just first John, big quarter for your government business. I wonder if you could just give us an update on that. And then Bill, one of the things I think John has done really well over the last couple of years has been lifting ServiceNow's profile with CEOs not just CIOs and I was wondering if you can have some thoughts on how you'd continue to make ServiceNow your brand that's not only trusted and well-respected by the CIO sweep, but really take it up to be a key and critical platform for CEOs as they go through their digital transformations? Thanks. John Donahoe : I'm going to answer your first question -- in fact I have to say, I will let go on second, but I have said repeatedly, internally in the last few days. Bill McDermott makes my role of desk look poultry in terms of his relationship with CEOs all over the world. But I'll let him comment to that in a minute. On federal, look federal, very strong business for us, very strong third quarter. Again what's driving it? Governments are embracing cloud, because they're under pressure to deliver better experiences for their citizens and employees and drive productivity. So we're seeing that in the U.S. federal business and we're seeing that in other public sector markets around the world. But in Q3, we had 13 deals in U. S. federal over $1 million compared with five in Q3 of last year. We had a nice mix of federal and civilian agencies. And we have a nice milestone in Q3 that will get good prospects going forward and that we received our FedRAMP High and IL4 certifications. What's interesting Kirk is that federal is starting to behave as federal has embraced cloud, its beginning here a little bit more like enterprise and it's less a only Q3 scenario and it's more continuous scenario. So year-to-date we've got 22 deals greater than $1 million compared to 14 in all of 2018. So we had good federal first quarter, second quarter and third quarter. And our pipeline looks strong in Q4 as well. So Bill very good of a U.S. federal. I'll also note, as I mentioned we're seeing nice demand for public sector globally. So we saw large deals and public sector customers in the U.K. In that case it would be U.K. equivalent of the IRS, the HM revenue and customs agency. And big public sector new customers in Germany and Australia as well. So strong business, I think that's going to continue to be a strong business. Again an area that Bill brings a lot of experience in. So you want to talk about CEO stuff? Bill McDermott : Sure, John. As John said, I am like-minded with John. We're very similar executives in the sense that we recognize the power of power. And last year I think we had something like 34 heads of state types of meetings around the world. And on the CEO front, one of the things that brought John and I together over the years is the CEO meetings that I host and I was very fortunate to have John join me. And as an example, we have one coming up in November, where there'll be 100 CEOs from around the world and some and of the biggest business cards in the world. And we do this on SAP does SAP does this not only in United States but also in Europe and Asia. So the rolodex is really strong and I believe that John and I had kind of executives that work our heart out to help hard-working CEOs solve mission-critical business problems so they can help their customers be successful. And that's the attitude we kind of bring to those relationships. When we make promises we keep promises. So it's really been an honor to operate at that level. And the altitude of there is nice and clear and it helps the conversations down below to take place faster, better and bigger. So that kind of where we run it. Kirk Materne : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Matt on for Sterling. Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys talked about on the macro side, but specifically have you seen any impacts on Brexit or any impact on demand from the FX changes that you guys were talking about previously? John Donahoe : Yes. Short answer is no. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl [ph] with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And congrats to you both. Maybe my question to you John. You mentioned that you want a strong fourth strong. We all do too. So, maybe I'll press you a little bit there because as you're well aware the implied growth rate for your subscription billings is much stronger in 4Q than the quarter that you just put up. So, I'm just wondering if you could help us get comfortable with that expected fourth quarter acceleration, what gives you that confidence. That would be helpful. Thanks a lot. John Donahoe : Yes, Karl. So, we've been saying all year long that we continue to see great seasonality in the business and so Q4 is increasingly important. Frankly, we've had visibility into this all year long that the Q4 pipeline looks strong. And part of that I think frankly is as we become more strategic and have larger deals, I think customers have a little bit of an inclination that the larger deals tend to get down more in their last quarter of their year because they're confident they can fund it. And I just remind you from a billings standpoint, 50% of Q4 billings is contracted backlog. The second next big piece is renewal, so we know we have great visibility into renewals coming into Q4 and given our very high renewal rate that gives us confidence. And frankly, the smallest portion of our Q4 pipeline -- or a small portion of our overall billings is net new ACV. Now, we've got a strong pipeline, we do bring up a strong net new ACV quarter, but it's -- remember the foundation of the contracted backlog and the renewals, we have great visibility going into the quarter. So, that said, in every quarter heads down, focused, working with our customers. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you, John. That's helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Rakesh Kumar sitting in for Jen Lowe. My question is for Bill, SAP has very well served large enterprises as well as mid and small businesses whereas ServiceNow has largely focused in large enterprises so far. Do you see an opportunity to take the prior down market and what should we expect there? John Donahoe : Yes. Well, I mean first of all, it's really a privilege position to be focused on large and still have so much room to grow. And there's nothing wrong with being very focused and segmented on large when you're putting up these kind of numbers. So let me first in high respect say good for to ServiceNow and good for the engineers making products that those big companies need to complete their digital transformation. I really mean that. It's a focused company. It's a really good thing. Now, can you take this down market? Absolutely. And the question then becomes between spreading your wings in the large space and taking it down a little bit in the channel strategy that you approach that with and the cost of sales that you work that with, are all items that we'll be discussing in the coming weeks. And of course we'll talk about it at the annual guidance as we go into next year. But theoretically, it looks like another big opportunity for ServiceNow. Jennifer Lowe : Thank you. John Donahoe : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Great, thanks. And, Bill, I didn't think I could talk to you so quickly, but good to have you back. I'm curious just on two markets in your adjacencies on the CSM side and the HCM side. I guess, it's probably a question for John. Are you starting to see we're starting to hear some of the competition, I guess, wake up a little bit, realize there's these opportunities you're pursuing. And I'm wondering, if you're seeing any change in the field in competitively and how you're responding and how you're taking the product direction, given what's going on in CSM and HCM? John Donahoe : Yes. Well, Walter, I think you're right in that, what we're seeing is validation of the need and the demand. I was with one of our top five. In fact, I've been with three of our top five SIs partners in the last three weeks. And employee service delivery is on the lead of all three, because companies know they have to improve their employee experience and they need to drive healthy sources of automation and productivity. And an end-to-end cross-functional employee service delivery is part of that. Customers or employees don't really care if the issue is HR or IT or finance or facilities. They just want to get it dealt with. And that's what we do. We are the only platform out there architected to do cross-functional workflow. And so, it's a very different thing when that's your starting point versus having a functional platform and hoping you can do a little process for workflow around it. And so, I just think our platform is architected from day one to address that market. By the way, in partnership with a lot of other platforms, right? We are not a system of record in many of these functions. And so, what our sweet spot is, is that ability to integrate in with the other platforms. And Bill talked about platform of platforms, the enterprise, or the employee service delivery, some people call it enterprise service delivery. Our role of integrating the multiple systems of record and the other systems, so that the complexity is hidden from the employee and they have a great experience. And by the way, we don't put our brand on it. We have a different point of view than others do on that. We think that employees want to have that brand of their company they're working for on their mobile app or on their desktop. Similarly, at CSM, I've said this before, so this is probably the last time I'll be able to say it, CSM is a $20 billion market, big market. There are different segments in that market; there are some segments that are more CRM-based where you want your customer service agent to be connected and tightly integrated in with the CRM system. There's another segment of the market which is our sweet spot, where you want the customer service representative have to be connected into the operating system of that business. So that when a customer calls or reaches in, you can't just say, oh!, you've been a customer for eight years. We'd like to be on the phone with you for a long time. You say, no, we understand what the root cause of issue have is, we're getting it addressed, we're getting regular real-time updates on how it's getting addressed. And by the way, next time it happens, you're going to be able to do it in an automated fashion and there might not be a next time, because we understand the cross-functional workflow, the cross-functional root cause so that we can fix the problem and prevent it from happening again. That's our sweet spot. That's what our cross-functional platform does. In essence it's the same concept of ITSM or other things we do. And so we're seeing very good success in that segment of the market. It tends to be B2B, services, technology, really high-value situations where the customer -- and I was in -- for instance, I was in Europe last week, two large telcos -- I met the President and CEOs of the business side of two large telcos who are saying they are increasingly driving software-as-a-service to their customers. And when their customers contact them, they need to see inside their network, they need to be able to see -- have great transparency and not just ServiceNow does. So, I think you will see multiple winners in the CSM space. It is not a zero-sum game. It's an opportunity to apply technology in ways that hasn't been done before, we think is a big opportunity for us, right Bill? Bill McDermott : Absolutely, John. 100% with you. John Donahoe : And Bill by the way brings a lot of experience in that space and will bring additional perspective and insight and frankly, both of those spaces can build almost unique -- anybody in the industry has played for years in almost all the major buying standards inside of the company. And I've been so struck in our conversation, he see scenes I didn't know exists. He know all the scenes in between the software is where this unmet need and opportunity because of his broad experience across all about buying centers in each of these areas. And so I think ServiceNow is going to -- he's going to bring even additional insight and energy to these new areas. Bill McDermott : Thank you, John. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Christopher Merwin : Okay. Thanks very much and let me add my congrats to John and Bill on the incredible opportunities ahead. And Bill when you look at the opportunity for ServiceNow, there's obviously an enormous TAM here and it seems to be one that grows every year as the company keeps adding more and more new products. So, when you think about how to go after that opportunity, can you maybe just talk to us a bit about your philosophy on balancing investment and growth. And more recently for ServiceNow the commitments been 100 basis points of margin per year and I'm sure you'll hear more about this at Q4, but maybe you can just share your initial thoughts there. Thanks. Bill McDermott : Yes, Chris, it's a great question, right? Because one of the power pieces of this whole equation is that this is a native born in the cloud company. And it's a company with a great platform and enormously successful products and very, very happy customers. The loyal employees are -- is also significant as John mentioned. If you put all that together, this is an organic growth story. And when you have an organic growth story and you can evolve that over time, there's plenty of growth from the core on an organic basis where you cannot only grow the revenue at a rate that's pleasing to the capital markets, but also you can expand the margins. And we can be very discerning as to what tuck-in we may or may not choose to do on that basis because we want to do both. We want to both grow the topline and we want to evolve the margin expansion story of the company because we can. So, you should expect me to stay very in concert with John's strategy. You should expect a tremendous amount of continuity between everything that John has told you. It's one of the reasons I'm here by the way because I believe in John and I believe in the management team on what they've been doing and we're going to evolve that. But I also learned a lot of lessons too because other companies who don't have such a pleasing business model, have to do perhaps more M&A that would be negative to the operating margin expansion, at least for some period of time. Here, I think we can balance this out pretty nicely. Christopher Merwin : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rangan [ph] with Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much, John. You get to do it. So just do it, congratulation. And Bill congratulations, an exciting chaperone new journey. I'm curious to get your perspective from your SAP. As you had a tremendous playbook at SAP that drove significant organic growth rate coupled with innovation. What about that experience and what about that playbook, can you bring to the ServiceNow chapter field life and congrats again. And thank you so much. I'm really excited about this. Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much. I am really, really excited. Also I'm very excited for John, and I think it's so nice that you all recognize what a great man he is and deserving years of an iconic brand like Nike and vice versa. So it's really great. What have I seen that might be transferable here? First of all, they are doing a lot of things extremely well. It's really more a matter of scale and some of the things that we had to do to scale there for example a value engineering methodology, where you could have a proven science around the value you create for an enterprise and the manner in which you personalize that to buying centers in a way that's compelling and highly repeatable and differentiated by industry. So that's one clear example. Another clear example is the way you broaden the perimeter. Right now, I believe that the TAM of ServiceNow is limitless, in the sense that, if you really think about how broken most enterprises are and how net up the workflow and business processes are in most companies and how unpleasant using these old systems are for the users. We literally could create a revolution, where the business users in the enterprise demand ServiceNow get the story straight by aggregating the workflow of these various platforms. I'm not sure that any work has actually been done on identifying the size of that TAM, but I believe it's only limited by one's imagination. We heard also, earlier today the idea of how we could expand in Europe and John talked about how many million dollar deals are now happening in the European theatre, perhaps there is a few place within Germany and France in certain areas of Europe where the relationship plans can be appreciated in a positive way for ServiceNow. But that certainly isn't limited there, you have Korea you have other parts of Asia, where we could be very interesting based on international business and global companies and prior history. And then I think one of the colleagues also brought up, how you can move the company into different markets based on the dynamics of the size of the customer, the size we established. I think we're focused on 5,000 employees and better now, when you go to 4,000 to 3000 that creates yet another opportunity. And finally, I think the team has done a great job here of expanding the ecosystem. but if you look at the ecosystem and the relationships that I have in the ecosystem there maybe a value play here or there with some of the partners not just the biggest ones, but also the mid-sized ones around the world. So all-in-all I mean, this is like one of those dream of a lifetime opportunities and my problem is that my feet just haven't touched the ground. I'm just walking on air. Unidentified Analyst : Congratulations. Thank you very much. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks and congratulations. And Bill, look forward to working with you. First, I guess John your finance operations product one GA in Q3, could you just can you talk about the initial interest and what you're seeing in terms of pipeline build as you go into Q4 next year. And then Bill I mean you know the ERP space better than anyone and this product integrates directly with ERP spaces. And so it would be great to get your take on what you're hearing in terms of early interest and kind of how big of an opportunity you see this market being for ServiceNow over the next several years? John Donahoe : Yes, Derrick just a general availability. We are still working on the next-generation implementations of our existing customers. So those I think come along well. And here's what's interesting, the biggest initial interest is from some of our SI's. And so as I think you know we have an explicit partnership with the White, for instance, around -- because they see how many of their clients need this capability. In many ways it's one of those themes I was talking about earlier. There's great software in the finance world. Bill knows it. Bill forgot more about than I know. But from everything we hear, they'll be seeing that our weathers is on structured workflow by closing the books, and so our SI's have given us a very strong indication they want to be part of go-to market solution and that's great, because we don't have long, deep relationships to date in the finance department. And so Bill you've got lots of experience in that world, so. Bill McDermott : Yes, John. I think you said it beautifully. I mean, the idea is within the context of these systems, be it financial systems, capital management systems, even if you think about supply chain systems and manufacturing systems there are areas of the workflow that are not meeting the modern needs of the modern user. And we are in a hold position to architect that workflow in a way that's highly pleasing to lighthouse customer and then that is transferable from that lighthouse customer at the high end to many other customers around the world. And you could certainly segment that by industry. And then you really start to think about that by buying center. And if I learn anything along the journey, it's the empathy that goes into the initial meeting because it's preprogrammed, it's outside and manufactured and it's choreographed in such a way where even people that might be fairly new at the company or people that are looking to up their game have the tools in their hands to do a great job for the customer. And the more we can do that in a way that doesn't require somebody of John's caliber, but somebody that's just carrying a bag to the extent they can do that, you start to get mass scale. Furthermore, I just want to say, I have spoken with the co-CEOs of SAP, whom I'm working with in friendship by the way in achievement of their goal as well. It's really a beautiful situation, where everybody really does care genuinely about the other and we have an affinity for SAP from ServiceNow's perspective and ServiceNow has, I mean, SAP has a very strong relationship and affinity for ServiceNow. They told me that. So I spoke with Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. Christian Klein is you or may not know was the lead decision-maker and actually choosing ServiceNow to run the IT operations of SAP because there was huge value creation for SAP by doing that. And we talked about the importance of this partnership and what could be done in the open market. So I actually think that you should really takeaway from this. But again, it's a great foundation that's already in place that can be built upon. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks for the color. John Donahoe : My pleasure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is open. Thomas Roderick : Thank you for taking my questions. And I'll echo the sentiments from others and saying congratulations to you both. My question here is for Bill. Bill you've got a couple of questions already just on the general sentiment of M&A. I'm not going to ask you to share your playbook before you get in the seat. But as you yourself has scaled, SAP over the past decade, would love to hear about your general philosophy towards M&A and particularly M&A at scale. Well, how do you think about the risks, the opportunities of doing M&A at scale and what is work for you and what hasn't as you look back at your past you apply it to the future with ServiceNow? Thank you. Bill McDermott : Well, Tom, thank you very much for the question. And I'm really happy you asked that question, because you've given me an opportunity to kind of set the record straight. Because ServiceNow is not SAP and SAP is not ServiceNow. These are entirely different companies at entirely different stages of their evolution and they have very different business models. So what I believe is that SAP did a great job of taking the core and expanded the perimeter into the cloud through strategic M&A. That was done very effectively. But as you know, when you do M&A you also have to integrate M&A and you have to put all the pieces together over time, because you want to make sure that customer relationship is absolutely best-in-class. So you have to walk and shoot gun, right? You have to get revenue right, the margin profile right, but also the happy and loyal customers. And I think SAP has done a very good job with that. On the ServiceNow side, with the way we're positioned and the literally immaculate nature of this amazing platform and these solutions that the whole world needs and it's a matter of expanding the solution set, it's a matter of getting to new customers, the new geography, expanding the industry, expanding maybe the market profiles, but it's all there. All the pieces are there and the TAM for being the platform of the platform and really working through that workflow scenario, where we can continue to build. We have developers that can build solutions. We have customers that can build their own solutions on the platform. We can literally take customers build solutions and make them commercially viable successes all over the world. So this is a juggernaut waiting to happen on its own organic means. Now to the extent we weren't to do strategic M&A and I'm just giving you my bias, again this is not a decision this is just what I honestly think from the answer to question is that, I would be very careful with it. You should do tuck-ins where it's in the best interest of the customer and obviously the shareholder. But it should never affect the pristine nature of this platform, because I think our customers are really relying on ServiceNow for that simple, beautiful, gorgeous user experience and they really expect us to be so perfect with the workflow and so pleasing that they just walk away from the relationship after the transaction and say, I can't wait to do another one. Keep making me happy, keep me loyal. And that is the culture here that is super powerful and I would never want to do anything to jeopardize that. Thomas Roderick : Outstanding. John Donahoe : Okay. Thomas Roderick : Those are great insights. Thank you. John Donahoe : All right. Well, everyone, I hope you got a good flavor of why I'm personally, the Board and organization is so excited to have Bill onboard, rest assured, heads down focusing on Q4 and a lot of momentum into 2020. So thanks for joining us in today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would like now to turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our Q4 earnings call. As you've already seen from our earnings release, we finished 2019 very strong, beating the high-end of our guidance for Q4. Allow me to share a few observations. We had 76 deals greater than $1 million in the quarter. Our performance underscores the strength of our core IT workflows. We had 16 ITSM deals topping a $1 million, that's our biggest number ever, and we signed our largest ITAM deal ever with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. IT is where digital transformation begins, and we are a powerful strategic partner for CIOs all over the world. CIOs are struggling with fragmented legacy technology, instead of delivering the experiences their employees and customers really need, our IT workflows provide a stable platform from planning to operations to service management. We're modernizing IT enabling high-performing services with modern experiences. That is enabling us to not only enhance the core of how IT works, but also extend the perimeter of IT itself. We're doing this across the entire enterprise, and that's driving momentum in our vast portfolio of products, including our fast growing HR and CSM products. Customers are realizing the strategic value of combining ServiceNow IT workflows with everything from HR, CSM, security, GRC, financial close, and DevOps to deliver greater value across the entire enterprise, and best of all, everything is powered by the Now platform, one platform, one data model, one architecture. There's a very deep sense of pride in engineering here at ServiceNow, and that distinguishes us in the enterprise software industry, and it shows in the results. We landed nine HR deals greater than a million, our largest number yet within a quarter, and in CSM, we now have over 1,000 customers using our technology to deliver better experiences for their customers. In most companies, customer service systems are set up only to answer questions, not to solve problems. This is why customer service agents rarely get to the root cause of the problem. That really frustrates customers. With ServiceNow CSM product, companies can drive end-to-end resolution, instead of solving problems in an ad hoc way, they can now focus on delivering great experiences, and great experiences drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty, and significant productivity gains. This is what every CEO and every company we talk to, this is what they want. Both HR and CSM are now over $200 million businesses for us, and we're just getting started. Let me share a few examples of how the power of our platform and products translated into strategic customer wins in the quarter. With a focus on CSM, we expanded our relationship with one of the largest global content companies in the telecommunications, media and technology industry. You see, they needed one solution with one platform to serve their customers. Using our workflow and integration capabilities, they're now consolidating all customer-related processes into streamlined workflows. In Latin America, we expanded our relationship with one of the region's largest banks. After seeing tremendous returns on their initial ServiceNow investment, the bank is implementing the Now platform and our IT workflow products across its entire employee base, replacing more than 10 siloed legacy systems. Earlier, I mentioned our largest ITAM deal ever, which was part of a bigger IT portfolio deal with the United States Department of Veteran Affairs. ServiceNow is the core of the VA's Enterprise Service Desk, which supports more than half a million full-time employees and contractors. With our IT portfolio and the cross-functional capabilities of the Now platform, the VA is streamlining processes, saving time and money, improving productivity, and better managing technology assets, and of course, delivering better experiences. Bristol-Myers Squibb purchased three IT products plus HR to enable a world-class onboarding experience for all employees. In a competitive sales process, Bristol-Myers Squibb recognized that our cross-functional enterprise capabilities are exactly what was needed to accelerate productivity, reduce new higher turnover, and win award for talent. In a strategic C-suite win, Roche, the world's largest Biotech company has signed an agreement with ServiceNow to support its digital transformation strategy. ServiceNow will be the global solution to service project and portfolio management across the entire Roche group. This strategic partnership will help Roche transform its internal business processes end-to-end, simplifying and improving the user experience. This will enable Roche scientists and researchers to work in a more agile way, so they can redouble their focus on their business, which is creating innovative healthcare solutions. These customer examples demonstrate the enterprise value that ServiceNow delivers. Our customers know that behind every great experience is a great workflow. The power of the Now platform, combined with the quality of our IT, employee, and customer workflow products are expanding our addressable market dramatically. Digital transformation is the biggest opportunity of our time, and ServiceNow is exceptionally well-positioned to seize this opportunity to compete and to win. We're a game-changer company for our customers and shareholders. The opportunity to scale ServiceNow is right in front of us, and we have our sights set on achieving $10 billion in revenue and beyond. To continue driving our growth, we're focused on five clear priorities for 2020. They include, one, being the trusted innovator for the C-suite, this starts with our brands making every C-suite leader aware of ServiceNow and what we can do for them. You may have noticed we launched our new brand campaign across all channels this week. We're receiving rave reviews. I personally love our brand. It's so human, personal, and inviting; we'll keep it going. Number two, we're engaging customers with a world-class go-to-market machine. The company already has a strong go-to-market organization, and we're now taking it to the next level. Number three, we will force multiply ServiceNow with a strong industry and partner ecosystem. The ecosystem is going to become more strategic and more powerful. Our partners tell me they see ServiceNow as the cross-platform integration engine of the modern enterprise. Going after industry verticals and building strong partner relationships will force multiply ServiceNow's coverage by 10x. This will happen across GEOs, industries, and across buying centers. As you saw Monday, we announced our new industry solution strategy and our expanded partnerships with Deloitte in banking, and Accenture in telecommunications. Number four, we're creating product experiences that people at work will love. The Now platform is ServiceNow's secret sauce. We're a platform company. In fact, we're the platform of platforms, and we're committed to excellence delivering an innovative, scalable, secure, highly available platform, and products that digitize workflows and deliver great experiences. Number five, teamwork; as you all know, teamwork does make the dream work, and it happens with trust, collaboration, and communication at mass scale. Our culture is our ultimate competitive advantage. All 10,371 and growing ServiceNow colleagues are committed to our purpose of making the world of work, work better for people. ServiceNow is hungry and humble, and we have an unwavering focus on serving our customers. We're so honored to have been added to the S&P 500, and to be recognized this month by Fortune as one of the world's most admired companies. The strength of our team and our culture is a culmination of a great leadership ServiceNow has benefited from for the past 15 years, starting with our founder Fred Luddy an incredible man and product visionary; to Frank Slootman, who successfully scaled Fred's vision; and a big heartfelt thank you to my great personal friend, John Donahoe, who set a rock solid foundation for the future. I'm truly fired up to lead the next phase of ServiceNow's journey, as we scale to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. We will accomplish this by delivering exceptional business value to our customers. We will do so across every geography, every industry, and of course, every buying center. We will continue to create workflows that deliver great employee and customer experiences. It is our dream to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. This is the limitless opportunity I saw in ServiceNow. It is why I chose to come here, and in my first three months as CEO, my belief has only become deeper, my commitment stronger, and my passion greater. Before closing, I want to thank our outstanding global finance organization, supporting a CEO and CFO transition, this team demonstrated extraordinary commitment, which leads me to my final note, we now have a world-class CFO in Gina. Asking Gina to join our team was absolutely the best first decision I could have made as CEO. I'm thrilled that she is here. I'm excited about this team and this company, and I cannot wait to deliver on our dreams for all of you. Thank you, and now, I'll turn the call over to Gina. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill, for those very kind words. Before we dive into our financial results and guidance, I would like to express my personal excitement to join Bill and the entire ServiceNow team. I'm incredibly impressed by the product portfolio, our focus on our customer's success, the extraordinary talent, and the hungry and humble culture that drives us to deliver world-class outcomes for our customers, and strong results for our shareholders. I could not be more impressed by what the company has accomplished over the past 15 years, becoming a strategic partner to the world's largest enterprises, as they digitally transform their businesses. Even though we've already come so far, I'm fired up by the enormous opportunities still in front of us. I'm confident that we have the products, the talent, and the passion to reach our $10 billion revenue aspiration, and more importantly, to make the world of work, work better for people. I'm completely aligned with Bill on our five priorities, which I believe will enable us to reach our $10 billion revenue goals; and together, we are committed to driving strong top line growth along with disciplined investment as we scale to get there. Now, let's turn to our financial results. We delivered another outstanding Q4 and full-year, and we have a lot of momentum as we begin the New Year. Q4 subscription revenues were $899 million representing 35% year-over-year growth. Q4 subscription billings were $1.298 billion, representing 36% year-over-year growth, and our first quarter ever exceeding 1 billion in subscription billings. As Bill mentioned, our strong top line performance was driven by 76 new transactions greater than $1 million, our largest quarterly number ever, representing 49% year-over-year growth. We now have more than 5,200 customers, of which, 892 of them are doing more than $1 million of business with us annually, representing 32% year-over-year growth, and our renewal rate for the quarter continue to be strong at 97%. Remaining Performance Obligations, RPO, ended the year at approximately $6.6 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $3.3 billion representing 34% year-over-year growth. These outstanding results continue to demonstrate our strong product portfolio, our focus on building deep customer relationships, and our commitment to enabling customer's digital transformation. Moving on to profitability, Q4 operating margin was 22% and free cash flow margin was 36%. For full-year 2019, operating margin was 21% and free cash flow margin was 28%. Additionally, I would like to note that our Q4 GAAP net income was favorably impacted by a $574 million one-time income tax benefit from the release of the evaluation allowance on our deferred tax assets in a foreign entity. We have indicated in our recent quarterly financial reports that we believe that due to our international expansion and improved operating margins we could potentially conclude that evaluation allowance on these deferred tax assets would no longer be necessary. We reached that conclusion in Q4. As a result, we are reporting GAAP net income of $599 million and $627 million for Q4 2019, and full-year 2019 respectively. This is a one-time benefit and will impact year-over-year comparison in future quarters. Importantly, excluding the impact of this one-time benefit 2019 was our first full-year of gap profitability. Now, let's turn to guidance. For Q1 2020, we expect subscription revenues between $975 million and $980 million, representing 32% year-over-year growth. We expect subscription billing between $1.040 billion and $1.045 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. We expect a 22% operating margin and $195 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. For the full-year 2020, we expect subscription revenues between $4.22 billion and $4.24 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth. We expect subscription billing between $4.805 billion and $4.825 billion representing 27% year-over-year growth. We expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%, operating margin of 22%, free cash flow margin of 29%, and 196 million diluted weighted average shares. We are very pleased with our Q4 and full-year 2019 results and we are excited to continue our momentum into 2020. We're also extremely proud there are full-year 2020 subscription revenue guidance of $4.2 billion, exceeds the $4 billion total revenue target that was set back in 2015. I would like to conclude by expressing my sincere appreciation to my predecessor Mike Scarpelli, during my time in ServiceNow, he built outstanding relationships with our employees, our customers and shareholders, and I'm inheriting a well-managed and super talented organization. I look forward to meeting all of you at the upcoming conferences and our financial Analyst Day in May. Operator, would you please open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much, congratulations team and Bill, the messaging and the positioning of ServiceNow is exceedingly brilliantly clear. So, congratulations on that. My question for you, as I listened to your prepared comments, it appears that ServiceNow is firmly pivoting towards being more of an applications provider away from being just purely IT. You're talking about HR, CSM, etcetera, I'm wondering how do you go about organizing the go-to-market strategy, though given that you ran all the biggest applications companies in the world, what are some of the experiences from that role that you can bring to bear as ServiceNow embarks on a different chapter on its way to being a $10 billion revenue company? Congratulations. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Kash. I really appreciate your kind remarks. I think the most important thing I wanted to convey is business continuity, stability, and scale are the things that I'm most in front of right now. We have an excellent team, the go-to-market has been well-thought through, and the team itself is highly stable, and we intend to keep it that way. There are no plans to make coverage changes. What we have is what we want. What we will do is we will take a [bolder] [ph] position on the role that this incredible system of engagement, the system of action called workflow can take in the modern workplace. If you think about the problems that customers are having today, they have many systems of record, and unfortunately, when they try to think about how people work and how people want to work, they don't have the workflow that enables a team to really set on a course of executing a simple business process. With ServiceNow, that all changes, and you can see the impact that we've had on the employee with employee service delivery, you can see the impact that we've had on customer service management, and many of the big companies in the world today are figuring this out pretty quickly. So, we will go to market as we are today in the various geographies. We can expand our footprint. We clearly are going to focus on industries such as banking and telco. I referenced a few partner examples, you know we're doing very well and regulated, you can see that in the public sector in the United States, you can see that in Australia, where we're bringing in large deals, and I'm really encouraged right now with what we're doing in buying centers, because as you know, Kash, to expand as an end-to-end solution provider in the enterprise the backbone is IT, which is unique to ServiceNow, because every company wants to be a tech company, actually every company would ideally like to be a software company, but it all starts with that tech backbone, and we can carry that. We've proven it to HR, we've proven it to customer service management, we can prove it with the COO, we can prove it with the risk and compliance folks, and of course, we can also now prove it with CEOs, and I'm in particular excited about that because the rolodex that I have has been calling on me, asking me for new and innovative ways to help them either take cost out with better workflow, or bring in more revenue and growth, because they can manage their business more effectively. So, good news for the shareholder, no territory changes, no disruption, it's only on top value add for growth. Kash Rangan : Exciting, congratulations and best wishes. Bill McDermott : Thank you so much, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Turits : Hey, good evening guys, and congratulations and welcome to both Bill and Gina. Bill, I wonder if you could talk about some of the directions that you might be thinking in terms of the platform, you said this strength is this is a single platform. So I think that there has been some thoughts about how you might expand over time in areas like data, monitoring a wide variety of areas, just how you conceptualize that would be helpful relative to that platform? Bill McDermott : Sure, thank you so much, Michael. Well, first of all, the platform is very unique in the sense that, as you mentioned is one architecture, one data model, this is really a pristine platform that's fully integrated on our own code base. In fact, even when M&A moves took place, they were re-platformed onto the Now platform. So we have a really, really very, very clean company here, and as an example, even in the tuck-in M&A moves that we made, it was all about strengthening and making the platform even more robust for our customers. For example, in natural language capabilities or in AI operations, business continuity, it's all strengthening the argument of that strong platform. We have to make that an easy platform to consume for business analysts and technologists alike. So, that's one aspect of the growth strategy, and the other is to build applications on top of that platform. You know, I was working with one CEO who was very interested in having a rewards program built on the platform, but he wanted to do it in a couple of days or a week, as opposed to years, and he didn't want a team of consultants to have to do it. You wanted his own business analysts people to do it, and of course, we were able to do that for him in a few days on the Now platform. So, think of it as expandable on many dimensions. If you think about technology people, you think about analysts, if you think about business people, they're all going to build magic workflows on this magic platform to create immense productivity and growth in their digital transformation strategy. The other thing that's kind of interesting is, you know, Kash mentioned the kind of system of record players that are in the marketplace, and one of the very large systems integrators told me, and I did mention that in my remarks, that we view this as this unbelievable cross platform integration engine for the modern enterprise, because there're so many disconnected workflows and processes that this can be the glue that puts it all together. So, all those dimensions spell growth, we've actually even simplified it, we made the consumption of it easier, the pricing of it easier, and we just left our all companies sales kickoff meeting in Las Vegas, and people are more fired up than ever before about the growth prospects on the platform. Michael Turits : Hey, Bill, thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rakesh Kumar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I am sitting in for Jen Lowe, this is Rakesh Kumar. I wanted to dig a little more around your industry solution announcement that you made a couple of days ago. I was curious if there will be more products tailored for these vertical use cases, and also, outside of partner efforts, what sort of internal go-to-market motion is being put in place? Bill McDermott : Yes. So, one thing is kind of interesting, just on the partners in general, we have had numerous meetings with CEOs and Chairman of the largest partner firms in the world. In fact, they've been very kind. They've actually even come to Santa Clara, and most of them have come in with very robust ideas on what's possible, and none of them have left without at least adding a billion to the numerator of what they think is absolutely achievable with ServiceNow. So, some of these investments are in industries. For example, think about workflows that are industry based, that are focused on specific domains of the industry or the sub-vertical, and then think about how that could be personalized to the various personas in the operation. Again, the Now platform comes shining through here, because of its capabilities, and the IT backbone, and the nature of connecting workflows across various buying centers, and they're very interested in the industry, the sub-industry vertical, and the buying center approach, and we're trying to do a very good job of giving partners the ability to innovate, co-innovate with us in the customer, and to grow, and we're doing this across all the geographies of the world, or we might have a certain partner in a certain geography in a certain industry, and we could be very specific, but again, it's all about growth, it's all about opportunity, and it's all about honesty, open collaboration, and real trust with the partners, and the good news is they all know me. So they know we don't break promises around here, which is very helpful. Rakesh Kumar : And if I could add a follow-up around this recent acquisition of Loom Systems, does this acquisition signal your intent to move into complementary segments like APM or AIOps and some other infrastructure segment? Bill McDermott : Yes. I mean, first of all, regarding Loom, right, so this is really extending our core. So, if you think IT Service Management, IT Operations Management, this is essentially giving ServiceNow customers the ability to prevent and resolve IT issues before they actually become problems, right? So, IT departments today want to proactively pinpoint and resolve operational issues. They don't want problems. They want predictive analytics. The other thing is if you look at Gartner and I do value very much what they say. They thought it was a very, very giant step forward in really making our ITSM platform, that that AI operations engine of the enterprise, and we received a lot of positive commentary, but we also made moves as you know, with natural language capabilities and business continuity, and we're doing this all with the intent of strengthening the platform, but our core is our core. I gave you an outline of our strategy, and for now, we'll leave it at that. Rakesh Kumar : Great, thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : Hi, thank you very much. First off, congrats to you both on your first quarter, welcome, and we hit it out of the park. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Sarah. Sarah Hindlian : I have a couple of questions. First, Bill, hey, nice to meet you -- and first, Bill, you mentioned that you were growing quite sizable in HR and CSM, which is really nice to hear, but I was wondering if you can give us some color around how big ITOM is getting, and even how large you could see it growing as you start to integrate Loom and other such technologies, given how big the TAM is? And then I have a follow-up to Gina when you're finished. Bill McDermott : Yes. So, I mean, I think it's very, very good question, actually. So, if you look at this company, first of all, let's just baseline the company, if you take a look at some of the data I saw from Morgan Stanley as an example, if you were just to automate kind of a manual or paper-based processes in the enterprise, you have a TAM in the United States alone of more than $225 billion. If you think about that on an international level, you can climb up to $400 billion pretty quickly. So, all these businesses can be really, really big businesses, and we don't think of any business right now, in terms that are less than a billion. So, as you think about our mentality and just running the company, if we look at something, it's got a billion-dollar tag on it. And ITOM, what I'm impressed with this in particular, is it's growing so fast. So, in each year that you think of us, it'll much more than double. So, anything that much more than doubles within a year get so super excited. We're also seeing very large deals. In the quarter, we closed five that were bigger than a million, and essentially within the ITOM category 15 of the top 20 deals that we did had ITOM in the bill materials. So, this one could be a biggie. Sarah Hindlian : All right, thank you, that's very helpful. Good to hear. Gina, nice to meet you, and welcome. We were really curious about your new verticalization strategy, and I know Bill touched on this a bit on the call, but we've really seen this be a critical tipping point to growing very large industry businesses for SaaS vendors in the past. So, I was wondering how long we should expect the ramp of your new vertical practices to take, and maybe if we should even expect somewhat of a small or concurrent rise in S&M along with this move. Thank you, and congrats. Gina Mastantuono : Sure. Thank you so much, and I'm looking forward to meeting you as well in person. So, first of all, to reiterate what Bill said, industries are critical to our growth, and the vertical strategy is something that we're very focused on. We do not expect, however, to be adding huge overlay types of sales folks throughout the organization. So, we do not expect there to be a huge increase in sales and marketing as a percent of sales -- as a percent of revenue. We do expect that we will invest here, we will invest smartly, and disciplined, and we do expect that with the material and with our workflow products that this will ramp, but from a timing perspective, we haven't modeled that out, but it's something that we're very focused on, we are investing, so we do not expect to see significantly higher investment as a percentage of revenues for total sales and marketing. Sarah Hindlian : All right, thank you very much. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Sarah. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great, thank you so much, and I echo my congratulations on a stellar Q4. Welcome to you, Gina, and Bill. If I can start out with a question for you, now that you've had some time in the cockpit flying the plane and we've seen you standing in front of giant dream big signs in the Wall Street Journal full page yet, what are the biggest positive and negative surprises so far relative to what you intend to accomplish, and specifically on company culture, with teamwork being your fifth priority this year, and I imagine every year ahead, and something that we all know is very enduring for any company, what are your observations on ServiceNow as culture and perhaps how can you improve upon it to take things to the next level? Bill McDermott : It's a really great question, Brad. Thank you very much for your very kind words. First, I'd like to acknowledge Fred Luddy, because our Founder did an amazing job of not only building a platform with the customer's interests in mind, and that true empathy for the customer, but that became a pervasive culture in this company. Everybody shows an enormous empathy for the customer regardless of the department that they serve within the company. So, that is really positive, and I mentioned on my two predecessors in my remarks, I give Frank Slootman a lot of credit for taking Fred's invention, and scaling that at an important time in the company's history, and I gave my great friend John Donahoe amazing accolades for the job that he did in scaling it yet again, post Frank, to get it to where it is, at this point, and my job is to take it now and scale it to be the defining enterprise software company in the 21st Century, and I intend to do just that as we go for 10 billion and way beyond. So, what did I pick up along the way? Number one, culture, culture, culture. This culture is amazing, it's exciting, it's humble, and it always wants to keep getting better. Nobody here is looking for a pat on the back too long. They want to know what they could do to get better, and I love that. The second thing is the customers love us. I mean, it's amazing, not only in the loyalty rates that you see, which is the best in the business, but literally, I went to several cities, met so many customers, I'm now going on a world tour, we will hit three continents in the next 11 days, and I'll see many, many more customers, in addition, I will have at that point then touched every single person personally in the company, which is cool, because that's more than 10,300 people, and what you find is the customers they just love this company, and the products work, and we do what we said we do. They just want us to keep doing more, and in fact one of the things that I learned, and that I think I can help bring to the equation because you asked me for observations where I could also, perhaps find something that wasn't perfect or add some value, it's really in this maneuver to the C-suite, because if you meet the CEOs, I'm very used to meeting them, they would say I haven't had a call from ServiceNow, but that's after I just got done meeting with the CIO, the COO, and they told me how much they love ServiceNow. So, I think we can really broaden the perimeter with the buying centers. I think the expansion geographically is still there for us. There's a big opportunity in the Middle East. We have plenty of opportunities to expand in Europe. Latin America is still young. Japan is a big market for us. We're just going into Korea in a big way. So, all of that is there and more. So I would say of all the things I've ever seen, I'm so impressed with the culture, the idea of getting better, having an incredibly loyal customer base, and now we're moving to the C-suite in industry and buying center, and we're doing that with the ecosystem in mind, because I think there's an amazing force multiplier that comes ServiceNow's way with the expansion of our partners, and being a good partner is essential to being a defining enterprise software company in the 21st Century. So that is kind of where I'm going, and finally, please let me say one thing on behalf of my colleagues, the engineering pride in this company, the focus on products, when I talked to CJ or I talked to anybody on the P4, even when we get in front of the Board of Directors, we're talking product, we're showing demos, we're looking at the next generation of what's possible, we're rethinking the way work is done in enterprises, because we know people have so much to improve upon, but we do that not with PowerPoints, not with big slideshows, but we do this with product. Brad Zelnick : Bill, thank you so much for your thoughtful answer. I'm a big fan of the way winners dream, and look forward to your continued success. Thanks again. Bill McDermott : I'm honored. Thank you very much, Brad. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] for Keith Weiss, and congrats on a really strong end to 2019. Bill, in your script, you mentioned the momentum you're seeing around CSM and HR. But when I sort of look at your top 20 deals, what's striking to me is sort of the number of IT deals across ITSM Asset Management, IT business management, all over the Top 20 grid, could you sort of give us a sense about the IT portfolio overall in terms of the durability of growth that you're seeing in the IT side going into fiscal year 2020? Bill McDermott : Absolutely. So, first of all, Keith, thank you very much for noticing that because I like you have never seen a truly great company that doesn't have a great core, and we're proud of the core we like who we are very much here, and if you look at kind of the path of this 14 of the Top 20 deals included three or more IT products in the sale, ITSM is really on fire. I mean 16 deals were a million or more in the quarter with ITSM and 17 of the top 20 deals included ITSM. We talked about ITOM earlier, and of course ITOM, I made comments of it. I mean like we're growing that business like 51% in a quarter. So it's going extremely well, we had five ITOM deals that were greater than a million and there were 15 of the top 20, 15 in top 20 deals that ITOM. So then I said to myself, what about ITAM, I mentioned as you know the Veteran Affairs situation and we close two deals that were very, very sizable in the ITAM category. So what's the point of all this? The point of all of this is, our solutions are better together. And everything pivots from that back home IT core. And when we carry that back home IT core into the other domains of the enterprise, everything gets better. And that's why, I even explain to other enterprise software companies that are systems of record out there, we just make you better because what we do in our core emulates across all the buying centers on an end-to-end workflow level. And that just makes all of the partners that we have whether they're technology partners, or Systems Integration partners that much stronger, the growth in front of us with ITSM Pro and all the value add that we're putting into the platform will keep this company's core growing solid for years and years and years to come. Unidentified Analyst : That's very encouraging. If I could do one quick follow-up, if I may, you mentioned you just feel about the importance of partners and the ecosystem going forward calling out the recent strengthening of that partnership with Accenture and Deloitte. I was wondering if you can hit upon Microsoft, that was another strategic partner, strategic partnership that was signed on this summer around Federal but what do you see as sort of the partnership opportunities, the joint opportunities with Microsoft going forward in terms of strengthening that ecosystem play? Bill McDermott : Great, great, well actually in July, we announced a new partnership with Microsoft in which we'll be hosting ServiceNow instances in Azure. And the initial focus there is on public sector in the U.S. specifically, but also Australia. So we believe other highly regulated industries globally could also benefit from this focus. But of course, it's early days, I consider Satya personal friend, I consider Azure an amazing platform, and Microsoft they're a great company. I can tell you that I'm convinced we'll do big things there. I'm also convinced that my phone has been literally ringing off the hook with other very large companies that want to do more with ServiceNow. So we're open for business. We're opening for partnerships. And my advice to the partners out there is, don't waste too much time. We're on a move. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you, Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks, hi, guys. In your prepared remarks two of the tenants that you pointed out were kind of brand marketing and the go-to-market machine. I'm just curious how we translate that into what we should think about as the marketing spend for 2020 and the sales count hiring for 2020? Bill McDermott : Sure, maybe I'll start big picture. And then, Gina, I'm sure would love to add some value to this. So we're at the point now where we're investing in engineers and obviously, we're investing in channels that grow our company. And we're trying to keep it as lean as we can on the G&A side and let our great workflow technology keep it simple, keep us highly productive. So the margin expansion story can obviously be there. But we've been adding headcount commensurate with growth, and we're not going to get headcount in front of growth. So that's just kind of big picture. It's a pretty disciplined company. And we're going to keep it that way. For example, as I look at margin leverage and how we can improve, I think about keeping the company simple and simple things like we're a bigger company now, we got unbelievable customer loyalty. How do we make a frictionless company possible for our customers, so renewals are smooth, up-sell and cross-sell is simple and everybody in the company no matter what job it is, we can look at the revenue per employee scorecard and say we keep getting better, and in particular, we'd like to see that in sales. So for example, you're very aware of what we do with very large enterprises and large enterprises and how we cover our commercial space, but we're doing more and more with account development reps to drive pipeline, we're doing more and more on the inside sales level. So we can have a better return on our investment with sales headcount, and really drive on not just loyalty, but net new logos which remain a very strong focus for this year. So, count on us to get the top line and make sure while we're doing is the revenue per employee scorecard keeps going up. Gina Mastantuono : And I'll just add to that, we will continue to invest in the right places, but it's a very disciplined approach to investing. From a sales and marketing perspective, we will absolutely expect to see some leverage from productivity and sales, we will double and be investing in other areas, we'll also invest in brands. From an overall perspective, we expect some leverage and obviously we've guided to the total overall margin for the year. Sterling Auty : Got it, and then maybe one quick follow-up, renewal rates 97% is still very, very high. But it did tick down a little bit compared to the last several quarters. Were there any one-time items or things that we should look at that impacted it in the quarter? Gina Mastantuono : No, I'll say listen, 97% renewal rate remains industry leading and very strong. We're really proud of that. The most common reasons why customers doesn't renew is usually through M&A in consolidation. We're not seeing more customers choose not to renew because of anything with respect to pricing or lack of value at all. Sterling Auty : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Roderick : Yes, hi, thank you for taking my questions. And again, congratulations, both you had a great start to your respective tenures. Bill, would love your perspective given your unique background here with respect to the back office and thinking about the integration points with financials, ERP more broadly, ServiceNow has had a nice product in the market for under a year now for Close Management, would love your take on sort of where that product is in terms of readiness and your thoughts on where this company can go next in the back office. How do you think about that? Thank you. Bill McDermott : Yes, well, thank you very much, Tom. So first of all, I want to acknowledge that the systems of record that are out there need not worry about ServiceNow not being a good friend and a good partner. I think there're plenty of acknowledgements that customers have made substantial investments in these systems of record, and we respect that fully. And we feel very strongly that what we do with workflow and the nature of that can really add significant value actually to the system of record. So specifically, there was a very large airline that I called upon. And they were trying to do some very unique things, which if they were going through an upgrade cycle on a back office system of record, it would have been a very time consuming endeavor. But it was something that was mission critical, it was a real system of action they needed, we were able to provide that in less than 30 days. So that's just adding value to the system that's already there, not taking anything away from it, very important. As it relates to the Financial Close product, we have to have a leader on that and focus on that. It is an outstanding product. We have a very large pipeline for that, and we intend to pursue that vigorously in the marketplace. It's really baked in terms of math on that. Tom Roderick : Fantastic. Bill, a quick follow-up just on the VA deal, I think we've gotten accustomed to the third quarter, the September quarter being very strong federal, but it seems like the demand is sort of pacing itself out over the course of the year. Can you just talk a little bit more about how the Federal and broader public sector opportunity is shaping up now that the product portfolio continues to get wider and wider? Bill McDermott : Yes, I think this is going to be a huge opportunity. The world is going around pretty quickly because what's happening is these leaders of very important departments are capital constraint, and when they look at their operating expenses, and the fact that they have so much legacy, and so much inefficiency, and it's not like I'm telling the secret, everybody knows that and they shout that from the mountaintops. So the question is, what platform, what company can go in there with a very limited time to value and a very affordable solution to truly make a massive difference. I spent a day and a half there in December and in Washington and visited many of the agencies, one agency, who had 75,000 people also had 75 legacy systems that was designed to do one thing. Probably they could have gotten away with 74. So we went in there with a workflow solution that literally acted as the enterprise portal to aggregate the data from the system of record, put it on a mobile platform with a gorgeous user case where people by job type could click twice and achieve their mission. And it was so stunning. It was a huge cost savings and no matter what time of year you would propose something that transformational, someone's going to say where do I sign? Tom Roderick : Fantastic, thank you for the detail, appreciate it. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good evening, thanks for taking my questions and as others have said, congrats on a strong start to your tenure at ServiceNow and close to the year. So maybe, Gina, one for you, just I'm curious Mike had provided in the past recently, just the dollar base net expansion rate. I'm curious if that's a metric that now that you're in the role if you plan on giving that going forward, and maybe just how that looked in the fourth quarter and then just a follow-up for Bill? Gina Mastantuono : So we'll be providing expansion rate at Analyst Day in May. And it was very strong in Q4. Samad Samana : Okay, great. And then, Bill, I know you've touched on this as the calls gone on and but I think M&A has been something that people have thought a lot about though. One I guess just out of curiosity, was there any contribution to 2020, the numbers from the two small deals that you guys just announced? And then I guess as a dovetail to that, how should we think about the M&A philosophy will mirror what you've -- what we've seen in terms of smaller tuck-ins, or how should we think about bigger deals? Thanks again for taking my questions. Bill McDermott : Yes, Samana. Thank you very much for your question. First of all, there was zero contribution from any of the small tuck-ins to the revenue numbers that Gina and I reported to you today, zero. Secondly, the company has benefited and will continue to benefit from organic growth. There is a very large runway in front of us or organic growth. And when you consider the unique platform that we have, its ability now to move throughout the globe and into industries and new buying centers, there's just so much runway on an organic basis. So, therefore the tuck-in strategy is something that adds technology and value to the customer relationship, creates a larger moat for our best-in-class platform is the kind of thing that you should expect. At this stage, there are no large deals that are on the table, and if we were to consider something of that nature, I give you my word, I would spend enormous amount of time with the committee on that with our strategy folks, with our engineering folks, and we would pressure test that was finance, and look at that from every single angle before we actually even seriously consider it. So, we are really an organic growth company with small tuck-in as our preferred option at this stage, and it wouldn't change unless there is something dramatically interesting that would greatly benefit our customers and shareholders, and at this time, there are nothing of that kind on the table. Samad Samana : Great, I appreciate you guys squeezing me into the Q&A. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Pleasure. Operator : Your last question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Alex. Thanks for squeezing me in here and taking my question. Bill, in thinking about the CSM segment, clearly from the $200 million figure you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you guys are seeing success there. When we consider ServiceNow's evolving vision and mission in this category, what is the right way for us to think about how you guys supercharge that product segment in CSM? And then just given the different competitive environment relative to other parts of your portfolio, how should we think about the company's growth prospects in CSM more broadly? Thanks. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, John. I'm really excited about CSM. I'm excited about it, because I like swimming in big ponds, and that's the big TAM. What we are extremely good at is -- think of it this way, there is really three layers within customer service management that matter to the customer. One is the engagement layer, you know, do you know who I am, and can you have a multi-channel strategy around creating value with me? The second is really huge operational things that go on in the mid and the back office as it relates to workflow in providing the customer an excellent service. For example, we work with one healthcare agency this quarter that had 50 million claims that we're managing for them with service management. On the service management layer, if you think about field service for example, there is a high-tech company that has thousands of field service personnel in the field that are working with the Now platform on a mobile level with a gorgeous user experience, so their technicians can get the job done, and what I see especially with large workforces, especially if they're not extremely digital, they really benefit from how simple and consumer grade and mobile our application is. So, think of us as field service with service management more broadly, because we can get to the root causes of things like no other company can. That's what our platform is still to do. Think of operations we have, [technical difficulty] and on the engagement layer, there's some a lot going on in the media industry, and you know, there is one example where we have 20 million users engaging us, and we actually had 100,000 concurrent users touching on one of our applications within the first five minutes that they went live. So, we scale. So, we could do engagement, other people are there too, we can do operations like no one else, and we can do service management like no one else, or we can do all three. My opinion, the folks that are doing engagement should try to team up with ServiceNow, because -- and the operations in the service management side we are the best. We could do it all. So, you probably better off partnering with us if you have any doubts about what you should do with ServiceNow. Operator : It's all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call back to presenters for closing remarks. Bill McDermott : Closing remarks, I just like to thank everybody for joining us. Exceptionally proud of the 10,300 plus professionals of ServiceNow for the job that they did. I'd like to thank Gina for her leadership, and I'd like to thank especially my great friend, John Donahoe for the wonderful hand-off that he gave me in coming into the company, for the Board support, especially our Founder, and I'd just like to thank all of you for the confidence that you demonstrated in our company. We are just getting warmed up. We are fired up. We are ready to go. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vice President of Investor Relations, Lisa Banks. Thank you. Please go ahead. Lisa Banks : Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for ServiceNow\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Consistent with while we are operating globally, our call today is work-from-home. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our first quarter 2020 results and discuss our financial guidance for the second quarter of 2020 and full year 2020. Before, we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this conference call, particularly our guidance is based on information as of April 29, 2020, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions, including those related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The forward-looking guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts as we know them today. Many of these assumptions relate to the matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to the timeframes for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the impact of COVID-19 on our customers\u2019 purchasing ability and the length of our sales cycles, particularly for customers in certain industries. Significant changes in the future could cause us the modify our guidance higher or lower. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and MD&A in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and our 10-Q that will be filed for Q1 2020 for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We\u2019d also like to point out that the Company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income and remaining performance obligations. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, our investor presentation and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. Please note that due to the short-term uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, we have decided to postpone our financial Analyst Day for a future date. We expect it will occur in the second half of the year, so we can provide more visibility into 2021 and the longer term operating environment. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q1 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. We wish a speedy recovery for anyone affected by COVID-19, and of course, our hearts go out to those who tragically lost a loved one. For the millions of people economically impacted, we\u2019re doing our part to support those in need and to get the world working again. We are truly in this together. Here are the key takeaways I\u2019ll reinforce in today\u2019s remarks. First, ServiceNow is a unique platform, a very strong company. We are well-positioned in this seminal moment. Next, digital transformation was a business imperative pre-COVID with $7.4 trillion of projected spend over the next three years. Post-COVID, digital transformation will accelerate, and ServiceNow is the workflow standard for digital transformation. And most important, the Now Platform, the platform of platforms has become the standard for workflow design experiences. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world in Q1, ServiceNow focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, serving our customers and supporting our communities. Leadership, by example, has never been more important. We never stopped pushing. We will not slow down. You\u2019ve seen our earnings release. We delivered a strong Q1, beating guidance and consensus. We have shown we can deliver. In March, as the pandemic was being felt everywhere in the world, our more than 11,000 employees seamlessly transitioned to a work-from-home environment. I\u2019m so incredibly proud of how ServiceNow employees adjusted. Our team focused, they executed, they delivered. Employees feel motivated, inspired and proud. After shifting to work-from-home, we held our biggest all-hands company meeting ever, a live global digital event, where we laid out our plans to support each other and to serve our customers. Feedback from our recent employee satisfaction survey is also very encouraging. 99% are excited about our future, 95% feel more inspired by our purpose than ever, 98% feel confident in our crisis response. ServiceNow employees are ready to lead. We\u2019re strengthening the amazing purpose culture and character of our company. Our seamless transition to work-from-home is a powerful demonstration of the Now Platform. Our cloud native Now on Now solutions enabled our employees to maintain and often improve productivity. Our Virtual Agent technology, our Now Mobile app, our digitized workflows on the Now Platform allowed employees to easily self manage their work requirements. We didn\u2019t miss a beat supporting our customers. Our cloud uptime numbers remained world class. Cloud consumption stayed high as customers relied on the Now Platform as a workflow workhorse. Around the world, we see the customers who are farthest along in their digital transformation are better equipped to manage this crisis. Companies lagging behind are realizing that they now have a burning platform. Accelerating digital transformation has become a business imperative. Behind every great experience is a great workflow. Today that matters more than ever. The power of the Now Platform has become self-evident to customers in this pandemic. They\u2019re leveraging the Now Platform to quickly deploy workflow apps that enable better crisis management and business outcomes. Our COVID-19 emergency response apps are a great example. These four apps, one developed in partnership with the Washington State Department of Health, and three developed by our own team, were released at no charge at the end of March. More than 5,000 installations have taken place. Washington State, San Francisco and Los Angeles are just a few examples of how we are helping government agencies respond. CIOs are telling us that their teams are using the Now Platform to deliver workflow designed experiences that their companies need now. For example, the Lowe\u2019s Corporation was facing a surge of emergency paid leave requests due to COVID-19. Within 96 hours, they built a mobile leave request app on the Now Platform and deployed it to 330,000 employees. This is what Q1 want was all about, leading, helping our customers deal with reality, helping them do what needs to be done. Let\u2019s look at some of the results now. We had 37 deals greater than $1 million this quarter. That is up 48% year-over-year. In fact, most deals closed in the final weeks of March, consistent with normal linearity. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 97%. We saw strength in the Americas, our largest region. We also saw a strong growth in APJ, despite the impact of COVID-19 throughout the quarter. Our Now Cloud went live in Seoul, South Korea in March, where we signed two new customers, representing major brands. We also saw a strong deals completed in EMEA, despite the challenging environment. Q1 results reinforced the strength of our portfolio. Here this, 18 of our top 20 deals with companies such as Merck, Humana, and Siemens included three or more products. This included our second largest new customer transactions ever, which was signed with a Fortune 50 leading U.S. insurance company. We saw great momentum with ITSM Pro, which delivers increased automation and operational resiliency for our customers. Our business continuity and integrated risk management products continued this strong momentum. 16 of our top deals included multiple IT products. Chevron for example, is realizing the power of the Now Platform by using multiple ServiceNow products across their business to drive productivity. They are now using our suite of IT products and they deployed our HR products to their entire 44,000-person workforce. We saw continued traction in HR and customer service management. Customers such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are leveraging HR Service Delivery to respond to COVID-19. Half of our top 20 deals included HR. We now have more than 50 CSM customers greater than a $1 million, including one of the fastest growing digital streaming services. This company launched an innovative game-changing digital business. They did it with ServiceNow. Our customer service management technology is foundational to helping them scale faster than anyone imagined possible. In Q1, we also landed our largest CSM deal ever in APJ. Japanese based Murata Manufacturing purchased CSM to enhance their customer support, reduce time to resolution and increase customer satisfaction. We also launched Orlando in March, our most innovative Now Platform release ever. Our day one adoption was ServiceNow\u2019s highest ever. Orlando features Now Intelligence, which gives customers unmatched AI, analytics and mobile capabilities across the Now Platform to support any workflow designed experience. Driving new levels of enterprise productivity is what Orlando is all about. The Office of Information Technology at Princeton University, for example, successfully upgraded to Orlando and went live with CSM. For instance, CIO, Jay Dominick says, they moved fast to implement CSM functionality to serve current and prospective graduate students, staff, faculty and other stakeholders. And I\u2019m talking to many CEOs and C-suite leaders worldwide. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re telling me. In crisis, they are focused on protecting revenue, ensuring business continuity, and driving productivity. They want an enterprise workflow platform that delivers ROI in 12 months or less. The good news is, fast time to value is a ServiceNow core strength. The ServiceNow advantage is one architecture, one data model, one platform. This gives us strategic authority to be the clear choice for all customers across IT, employee and customer workflows across all geographies, industries and personas. Our partner ecosystem sees this clearly. And they\u2019re doubling down on ServiceNow. We value how our partners Accenture, Deloitte, DXCEY, [ph] KPMG, and many others have stepped up to support our shared customers. Our Q2 fast start playbook is focused on the priorities that matter most to our customers. We\u2019re engaging our customers like never before. Our Q2 fast start playbook includes five key messages : Digitally scale operations quickly and efficiently; reduce technology debt, there\u2019s a lot out there; ensure resilience for critical business operations; deliver employees the right digital experience from anywhere; and create new workflows fast. Each one of these priorities drives great employee and customer experiences. Last week, in fact, we engaged current and potential customers with these. These solutions, in a global company wide prospecting day were built to drive pipeline. The results were simply outstanding. Our teams delivered three times greater pipeline than any previous prospecting day ever. Our messages and solutions are resonating in every sector and every geography around the world. We\u2019re also engaging customers and building pipeline through our Digital Knowledge event. This launches on May 5th. I encourage everyone to join us. We have six weeks of incredible content and digital experiences for our ServiceNow community. Knowledge already has more than twice the number of registered attendees that we had anticipated in the physical event we planned in Orlando. We expect the audience to keep growing throughout the next six weeks. It is going to be one heck of an experience. And this is a great example of how we have pivoted. We remain focused on delivering our customers and partners the connection, inspiration, and education that makes Knowledge such a special event every year. And most importantly, it keeps the ServiceNow community strong. Hey, I\u2019ve covered a lot here. So, let me recap. We seamlessly transitioned to a work-from-home environment and drove very strong Q1 performance. Our customers are innovating on the Now Platform to meet their crisis management, business continuity and productivity needs. ServiceNow is enabling customers to do what they must do to get the job done. Our pipeline is really strong. Our solutions are resonating. Our customers are asking for more. These are the actions and insights that have informed our outlook. Gina will provide more details on our guidance. She has led an exceptional analysis and thorough bottoms-up effort on all possible scenarios. Our guidance reflects a slightly broader range considering the well known uncertainties our customers face as a result of COVID-19 in the marketplace. Even as I say that, please keep in mind that ServiceNow is strong in all industries across the Fortune 500. And we are confident in our opportunities, our ongoing customer demand, and our solutions, and in the strong pipeline we see in our business. We are aware of the hard work ahead. We are taking nothing for granted. This is an innovation-led company with an incredible team. We have a proven track record and an unwavering commitment to customer success. Ladies and gentlemen, if it can be done, ServiceNow will do it. We are on the move. I\u2019d like to thank you very much for your time and attention. And I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Gina. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. We had a strong Q1, continuing the momentum coming out of 2019. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for subscription revenues and subscription billings and we delivered another strong quarter of operating profit and free cash flow. Q1 subscription revenues were $995 million, representing 36% year-over-year constant currency growth. Q1 subscription billings were $1.055 billion, representing 32% year-over-year adjusted growth. Remaining performance obligations, RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $6.6 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. And current RPO was approximately $3.3 billion, representing 33% year-over-year constant currency growth. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 97%. The strong top-line performance during this quarter is driven by continued expansion of our existing customers. We also continued to see strength in adding new customers. We closed three new customers that are paying greater than $1 million in ACV. Our cohort of customers paying us more than $1 million annually continues to grow significantly, up 30% year-over-year. We now have 933 customers paying us more than $1 million in ACV. We saw strong profitability in Q1 with operating margin at 24%, driven by our strong revenue performance, and less travel expenses due to the current work-from-home environment. Our free cash flow margin was 39%, benefiting from a seasonally high amount of collections from our strong Q4 billings. Our first quarter results demonstrate our position as a trusted innovator and partner to help our customers digitally transform. Before I move to guidance, I want to briefly discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Many of our customers are now operating in some very challenging circumstances. In response, companies, especially those in highly effective industries such as transportation, hospitality, retail [Technical Difficulty] may reevaluate how they\u2019re spending their dollars. CIO surveys and our own conversations with customers suggest though that software spending will prove to be more durable. We\u2019ve seen companies place a greater emphasis on return on investment and time to value. We remain well-positioned to weather the short-term challenges. And Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers\u2019 operations. We have a strong customer base across almost every industry. And over 80% of our business is serving large enterprises globally. As a result, we expect to sustain our high renewal rate. In fact, we saw many of our customers in the highly affected industries, renew their contract and expand their uses of the Now Platform in the quarter with a large portion of this occurring in March. As Bill mentioned, we entered Q2 with the fast start playbook. And I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed with how quickly we pivoted our go-to-market motion in this work-from-home environment. We\u2019ve seen early success as our pipeline continues to grow and we have been successful in closing business with both new and existing customers in the first few weeks of April. With that said, the challenges our customers are facing, particularly in Q2, have been taken into account in our assumptions. While our customers value the Now Platform and we know they are prioritizing their investment in it, customers may delay new transformation initiatives until we have greater visibility into the future operations of their business. Given the current operating environment, we expect some variability. However, we believe this will be most acutely felt by our customer base in the highly affected industries we previously discussed, which represent approximately 20% of our business. The other 80% are industries that are less affected. We are very committed to helping our customers manage through this difficult time. When required, we\u2019ve taken measures to provide our customers with greater flexibility and manage through the challenges. As Bill said, we are engaging our customers like never before. We have done a rigorous analysis to understand both the risks and opportunities ahead of us. Because of the potential short-term impacts to our business, we have made the following adjustments to our guidance methodology. First, our guidance assumes that the most significant headwinds will occur in Q2 and Q3. We\u2019re also assuming these headwinds will ease and the economy will open more broadly by the end of the year. Second, we\u2019ve increased the guidance range for subscription billings. This accounts for the increased uncertainty of new business, timing of renewals, and billing terms, particularly with customers in the highly affected industries.  While our guidance is based on the current assumptions about the macro environment, we are confident in our updated guidance and believe that by making these adjustments, we are appropriately factoring the risks created by COVID-19. As a reminder, we have good visibility into our subscription billings. On average, 50% is driven by backlog, more than 25% by renewals, and the remaining portion comes from net new ACV. Subscription revenue is even more predictable. Approximately 80% of the revenue that will be recognized for the remainder of 2020 is already contracted and included in our backlog. Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2020, which reflects the impact of COVID-19 and the FX headwinds, as a result of declines in the British pound of 5%, the Euro of 1% and Australian dollar of 12% versus the U.S. dollar. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $995 million and $1 billion, representing 29% to 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $960 million and $980 million, representing 20% to 22% year-over-year adjusted growth. We expected a 23% operating margin, up 500 basis points year-over-year due to a reduction in travel expenses and the transition of Knowledge to a digital experience. For the full year 2020, we expect subscription revenues to be between $4.125 billion and $4.145 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year constant currency growth. This guidance reflects a headwind of $52 million from foreign currency and $43 million reduction is driven by net new ACV compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance range. We expect subscription billings to be $4.60 billion and $4.66 billion, representing 23% to 25% year-over-year adjusted growth. This reflects a headwind of $52 million of foreign exchange and $123 million reduction driven by the low net new ACV compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance range. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%. And we are raising our guidance for full years 2020 operating margins to 23%. This reflects savings from reduced travel, lower G&A hiring and then transition of Knowledge \u201820 to digital experience. Looking into next year, we expect our investment in these areas to return to previous levels. Importantly, as we continue to feel confident about the long-term opportunity and path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond, we will continue to invest in strategic areas, such as R&D and sales. And we expect to maintain a thoughtful pace of hiring throughout 2020. As always, we will continue to be disciplined as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. We are maintaining full year 2020 free cash flow margin guidance of 29%, reflecting an increase in operating margin offset by decreasing collections due to the expected increase in DSOs. Finally, we expect second quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $196 million. In summary, as we navigate through this global pandemic, a few things have become clear. Digital transformation is accelerating as companies react to unexpected disruptions of their business. We will help companies transform the way work gets done. We have a world-class management and a right product portfolio to weather the short-term challenges. We will help our customers evolve and emerge from this crisis even stronger and better positioned companies. We\u2019re in a very strong financial position exiting Q1 with $6.6 billion in RPO and a strong net cash position of $2.2 billion. We will continue to invest for long-term growth. We have never been proud of our employees on their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities. Our helping and humble culture is stronger than ever. We can\u2019t thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, we\u2019d like to now turn over the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on a good quarter. Bill, I guess, you gave us some great insight on the kinds of customer conversations you\u2019re having right now. Given where you sit and kind of how you\u2019re driving these conversations forward, can you give us a real time look at the pace of business closing right now, in April? You talked about the fast start playbook. Can you just help us understand what you\u2019re facing right now and how you\u2019re pivoting the message, given the breadth and flexibility of the portfolio? And then, I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up. Bill McDermott : Alex, it\u2019s a great question. As you know, the in-process measures of what companies do in times of crisis cannot be overstated in their importance, and you\u2019re in a race against the clock in terms of how you execute. Having been through a few cycles in my career, like this, it was clear to me that we had to immediately jump in on the COVID response actions we took with the four apps, to work-from-home initiative, the all-hands communication to get people rallied around our customer, and then also, along with our leadership team, galvanize the Company around a Q2 playbook that really sold into what the customer needed in the face of a market crisis. Gina did a great job telling you about the market dynamic that we handle mainly high end customers and the Fortune 500, and 80% of them are in industries that of course feel some effects of COVID, but it\u2019s the 20% that feel the greatest shocks of COVID. So, the stage is set for ServiceNow to perform well. What I\u2019m seeing in the trenches as it relates to April is a continuation to what Gina and I told you about March. From the linearity basis, March closed as we would expect March to close and April has actually started faster than April did last year. So, on a year-over-year basis, our pipeline is bigger than it was last April. And what we actually have in the door is on a percentage basis higher than we had last April. And the forecast is not shaky, it is very solid when you talk to our sales leader, the executives that reporting to him, and you participate in the daily conversations in the trenches, like I do with people that run companies and run government entities. So, right now, things are going very well at ServiceNow. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And then, maybe just one follow-up for Gina. You mentioned payment terms or DSOs and investors right now I think are close to scrutinizing customer churn, dollar churn, contract flexibility, payment terms. So, maybe what are you seeing right now from customers, particularly in that 20% of industries that are impacted? And how does that inform some of your visibility and confidence around the guidance for subscription billings, current RPO, and any other factors? Gina Mastantuono : Sure. Well, I\u2019ll say that we\u2019ve not had any customers at this point that are unable to make payments. And so, our customer base remains very healthy. That being said, we have provided some flexibility and extended payment terms. So, a portion of our company, of our customers and those that are the ones that we\u2019re talking about in the highly effected industries. But so far, it\u2019s not [Technical Difficulty] customer base. We don\u2019t anticipate that payment deferrals or adjusted payment terms will have a meaningful impact on revenue or billing. It is why we have [Technical Difficulty] our cash flow margin guidance flat, even though we\u2019re increasing operating margin by a 100 basis points. We do feel like there\u2019ll be a little bit that will push into early \u201821, but for the most part, we feel very comfortable in our guide on free cash flow and bill. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Bill, if I can. Can you elaborate on how you\u2019re adapting your go-to-market strategy during these crazy times? Clearly, your value prop only becomes more appealing as the entire world pivots to digital. But, how has the field priorities changed, if at all, as it relates to new logo versus expansion business? Bill McDermott : One of the new logos, Brad, that I mentioned was Merck. And there were quite a few on new logos in Q1. But, here\u2019s a big thing. It might be a little counterintuitive actually, but one of my goals, as I told you in the last earnings call, was to be the trusted innovator for the C-suite and actually to elevate the level of contact that ServiceNow utilized in the marketplace. Right now, C level executives and CEOs in particular are easier to get to than they ever have been, because they\u2019re in their home office, and they\u2019re looking for a good phone call or a good Zoom, and in ServiceNow, they\u2019re finding one. So, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re aligning the presale, especially on the value drivers that are important to a customer in their specific industry, in their specific persona. And on an outside-in basis, we\u2019re studying very carefully, especially in the COVID environment, what we can do to help them. We schedule our team to essentially do -- in a physical world we had what we called executive briefing center meetings. Now, we\u2019re in a virtual world. We simply have the same executive briefing center meeting. Only, we can have many more of them because we don\u2019t have the wear and tear or the difficulty of getting calendars aligned because people have time on their hands for things that are mission critical and things that can give them immediate time to value and the priorities that they care about. And as I said, Brad, they care a lot about protecting the revenue they already have. Obviously, everyone wants to grow, but job one is protect what have. And then, this business continuity thing, we can\u2019t overstate it. For example, there is -- one very large consulting company out there with hundreds of thousands of people. And think about something like asset management and how you get the tool set, whether it\u2019s a phone or a computer or anything the workforce might need to work-from-home physically to them, trace and track it, and make sure that it\u2019s executed well across the value chain. So, think about all those enterprise asset management needs now being managed on a workflow basis between a virtual and a physical world. So, this platform of platforms is really resonating. So, I believe that it\u2019s logical for people to be concerned to say, well, you\u2019re primarily an enterprise direct sales go to market, but actually, it works even better in digital because the activity set increases and it\u2019s just easier to do business with C-level executives now than it ever has been before. The other thing I would mention to you, and I said it in my opening remarks is it\u2019s all about value. Right? The one thing about value that\u2019s changed though is the fuse has to be really short, not dissimilar to 2008. It has to be very, very short. I told you a story about Lowe\u2019s where we had them up and running on something with 330,000 employees and 96 hours. We have people installing ITSM Pro in a couple of weeks. And just compare that to the old system of record world and how long it takes to get the value. So, we\u2019re so relevant. And I want everybody to just think about the old value chains and how they are splitting apart and being reassembled into these end to end mobile first workflows on the Now Platform and how quickly you can get the value, and just how willing people are to engage digitally. And even the order agreements, it\u2019s all digital. You don\u2019t have to go out there and get things signed anymore. So, that\u2019s pretty much the net of it. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much. It\u2019s all very, very helpful, Bill. Maybe just quickly for Gina. I think, you mentioned slowing down on hiring. How has the hiring plan evolved since the beginning of the year? And have you noticed that it has gotten easier over the last several weeks or a month or so to find talent? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. I would say that -- what I talked about slowing hiring and we talked consistently about G&A now and into the back half. We will continue to aggressively hire [Technical Difficulty]. And in fact, [Technical Difficulty] today have been [Technical Difficulty] hiring in some of those areas. And so, we have really not seen a slowdown to date in our ability to hire and attract really strong talent, which is great. I think, what we\u2019re trying to do is be really thoughtful about hiring [Technical Difficulty] continue to hire for the critical [Technical Difficulty]. I want to make sure that we are well positioned to whether this short-term storm here. Brad Zelnick : Awesome. Thank you so much. Bill McDermott : Hey, Brad. I just want to give you and everyone else on the call a little color. Right? To build on what Gina is saying, we\u2019re hiring 9s and 10s. And just to net it out, this is a brand destination that\u2019s super successful and talented people now know about. One example is our Chief AI Officer, Vijay Narayana. Keep in mind, this guy has 15 patents. He ran data science solutions at Microsoft and engineering at Pinterest. We have the ability to attract the very, very best people in the market. And he was getting offers from everybody. And he chose ServiceNow. So, we are -- as we bring in engineers, as we bring in talented go-to-market people, we\u2019re also making sure that they\u2019re 9s and 10s. We\u2019re not interested in 8s and below. We\u2019ll leave that to the open market to rationalize. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is open. Sarah Hindlian : Thank you so much, Bill and Gina, especially for providing us an outlook. I think, we all understand it\u2019s very challenging, given what we\u2019re seeing right now. And sharing your process with us was extremely helpful. And I wanted to ask you a few questions. My first one is for you, Bill. We are hearing a lot about some of our companies. Now, granted, they have far more SMB exposure than you do, but really working ahead of time on the renewals side. And I was wondering if ServiceNow is pulling together a renewals team or some kind of prioritized focus on making sure that some of those distressed customers come through even under potential contract extensions. And then, I have a follow-up for Gina. Bill McDermott : Absolutely. Sarah, first of all, thank you very much for the question. We really want everybody to know that this Company is all about driving long-term customer loyalty. The sustenance of these customer relationships is everything in the cloud economics sense, but even more, it\u2019s everything in the sense of the ServiceNow culture. We have presale, sale, post-sale customer support, our consulting and partner ecosystem aligned in a value chain. We do this by industry, we also segment it by persona. In the 20% of our customer installed base, most affected by COVID-19, we have a cross-functional team that also includes legal, finance, presale, sale, and post-sale involved in the process. So, we do all we can to make our customers successful. We haven\u2019t had a single down sell. We have been flexible on cash where we need it to be, which Gina\u2019s stated. But, we\u2019re also looking at things that are win-win in the orientation. So, even if COVID were even worse than it is today, we expect it\u2019ll get better, but even if it was worse, we find that customers are realizing that the Now Platform is it keep the lights on technology in these companies, it is a have to have. And therefore, nobody has disputed whether or not they need to renew. It\u2019s just simply a consequence of can we help them get through this very difficult time. So, keep that in mind. The loyalty effect is getting even stronger because customers really are relying on the platform even more. And as I look at the root causes to why companies win and lose, customers have to love that product in good times and bad, and be willing to stick with that product because they really believe it\u2019s essential to their future. And that has been the case in every engagement, even the ones where customers needed our help the most. Sarah Hindlian : Awesome, Bill. Thank you. That was extremely helpful. I appreciate it, very thorough. And Gina, I just wanted to follow up with a fairly simple question, but an interesting one, especially given the depth of working down on guidance. The fiscal year outlook, the way you\u2019ve cut numbers, was better than I was hearing and definitely a relief to me. And you walked through how you were building the model. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s some maybe primary, one particular driver. I know, being the customer success platform is relevant. But, are you potentially also seeing or expecting to see a continued boost from enabling IT operations in a very-distributed perimeter, in a work-from-home environment? And is that the primary driver of the revenue build or is it as mathematical as you\u2019ve outlined? Gina Mastantuono : I think that as IT becomes the business now, IT ops is going to be super important. But that\u2019s not the only place where we continue to see strength. And so, we did a very bottoms-up, deep dive and we did extensive scenario planning for our pipeline coverage, our conversion, our renewal rate et cetera. And so, it\u2019s really about whether or not, from our original guide, we\u2019re just thinking that some of our customers in these highly impacted industries. We believe our renewal rates will stay strong. But, as we think about net new and digital priorities, some of them may be delayed. So, that\u2019s really where we\u2019re focused on when we\u2019ve brought down the guide. We absolutely believe that we\u2019ll be able to maintain our strong renewal rate. We believe that digital transformation will remain, a big priority, as Bill has talked about. So, we feel very confident right now with our current guidance. Bill McDermott : One thing and I think everybody will be interested to know this. It\u2019s kind of your question, but it\u2019s probably on everyone\u2019s mind. Why is it that we have such confidence? It\u2019s really because the customers telling us they have confidence in us. So, take the Department of Home Affairs in Australia. What they are doing is basically integrating the outdated underperforming, old solutions into -- in integrated platform. And that is helping them simplify their environment, drop down costs and improve productivity. The State of California as an example is a perfect one, because they went for a cloud first initiative. And that\u2019s all about getting stakeholders, vendors and partner agencies to cooperate. And that\u2019s why they chose ServiceNow customer service management. So, what you\u2019re seeing here is a recognition that the integrated nature of the platform, what the platform can do, and how it\u2019s so simple now to plug the processes into something that\u2019s modern, cloud and on the move versus the thing they\u2019re bogged down by in the old 20th century tech. So, we\u2019re feeling good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jeffries. Samad Samana : Maybe the first question, and I know you guys have touched on it a little bit. But as you think about customers, with everybody working remotely, I know you\u2019ve talked about the sales motion. But, how about in terms of implementation? Are those cycles moving at the same speed as before? Are they move being more quickly, and maybe what the puts in takes around the ability to do a full implementation from a remote perspective? Bill McDermott : Yes. That\u2019s actually a good question, Samad. I know initially, probably people had concerns as to how viable that was. But the reality is, it is very viable. And that\u2019s in fact what\u2019s happening. Not only can ServiceNow virtually implement the system but so too can the ServiceNow ecosystem. And initially, there may have been some training that was required with certain partners on how to do that but our substantial partners absolutely know how to do that. And that is the manner in which ServiceNow is being implemented. It\u2019s done virtually by ServiceNow as well as our ecosystem partners, not an issue whatsoever. Samad Samana : And then, maybe one more on just the go-to-market with the T&E being down with the events moving virtual, coming out of this and it\u2019s tough to answer but it seems like maybe the customer acquisition costs may just structurally come down over time. How do you think about that as those of us that are thinking beyond this crisis, eventually abating? Do you think that it\u2019ll just allow customers to be acquired more efficiently just going forward? Thanks again for taking my questions, and wish everybody well. Bill McDermott : Well, Samad, I wish you well too. And I\u2019d tell you are asking some great questions here. Because who would have thought that ITSM Pro could have been implemented by our partners in 21 days or less, remotely, pretty cool. And then who would have thought we would have canceled our Knowledge event in Orlando, which has been the physical event of the year, the epicenter of the ServiceNow story where we expected to have 25,000 people physically in Orlando. We already have 50,000 registered and signed up for our event, our Knowledge event in a virtual environment. And yesterday, our Head of Marketing and Communications who is leading this event and doing a great job I might add, told me that his anticipated headcount now for the event is over 100,000. You\u2019re on a good point here. We might very well learn that companies that are digitally transformed and attracting others who want to be digitally transformed, might actually get some brand recognition power from this and actually a lower cost of sale because of the bandwagon effect. And the second part is our motion on a virtual basis of coordinating all of the pre and post-sale layers I discussed is becoming far more refined than it was in the prior highly physical, high-touch world. So, we might still be able to deliver high value, but do so at a higher volume, in which case, you can lower cost of sales, get more deals and more flow through to the bottom line. I wouldn\u2019t rule it out. I\u2019ll put it to you that way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much. And I\u2019ll add my congrats on the quarter and glad everyone is doing well. I guess, Bill, just to start with you, obviously, you all are standing out in what is a very difficult economic period. I mean the answer seems somewhat self -- or somewhat obvious, but when you are talking to CFOs, I think when we go out and care about things like CapEx spend, obviously budgets are under a lot more pressure. People are really focused on their bottom-line maybe more so than ever and nervous about their own outcome. So, are you just getting the sense that you\u2019re consolidating wallet share within the IT organization or the organization in general? Are you tapping into new line of business spend that perhaps you weren\u2019t before this happened? Because, I think what stands out is, not only do you have a good quarter, but actually your business seems to be doing really well through a month, and I think that will be pretty unique when we hear from everyone else. So, could you just talk about how you all are maybe just consolidating spend amongst your customers at this point time? Thanks. Bill McDermott : Yes, sure. Well, Kirk, I want to thank you very much for the question. It\u2019s a really, really smart question because I start every meeting off with the C level executives or heads of government that we\u2019re speaking with regularly, daily in fact, on this concept of behind every great experience is a great workflow. And the Now Platform is a platform of platforms. You heard me say that when I first came into the Company. But digital workflows are becoming substantially important assets within every company. And what we see happening here is we see that the great experiences that every CEO wants for their employees and customers includes mobile web and conversational tools. We see clearly that the IT workflow is also essential to enable employee workflow, customer workflow, and then anything they want to uniquely customize they can use the App Engine on our platform to do it. And having this one platform with one data model and one architecture with by the way no debt, because of how well ServiceNow engineering has been handled for the last 15 years, you\u2019re able to really streamline, eliminate a lot of waste in these companies. And what I see happening is companies are telling me, why would I want to double down on a system of record when I can take the data from the system of record and put it into a new workflow where by the way with the Orlando Now Platform, they can apply machine learning and AI and get the real analytics that they need to drive employee experiences customer experiences. So, it\u2019s actually such a great return on investment. I haven\u2019t seen one scenario yet where I can\u2019t go to a C-level executive and say you ordered this from me today, I gave you five 5x or better the ACV value this year. And then, it\u2019s kind of like, well, why wouldn\u2019t you do it. One customer, for example, in this software asset management scenario, we also do hardware asset management, as you know, said I know that I have fully outdated solutions. I\u2019m under utilizing my shelf-ware and so forth. And I said, we\u2019ll analyze it for you. It\u2019s something we do. We haven\u2019t found a business case yet where we can\u2019t take 20% of the cost out. And the guy goes, really? Why don\u2019t we have it? I said look, if anyone\u2019s got any problem with it, I\u2019ll just split the profits with you. No, no, no, I\u2019ll order from you. So, that\u2019s the kind of environment we\u2019re in. If you want to talk cost, we can take it out. If you want to talk experience, we are the workflow behind it. If you want to talk executional excellence in a virtual world, this is the platform that cuts across all the systems of record, and enables all of the mobile web and conversational experiences to help the employees do their job or inspire the customers to be happy and loyal. So, I really think, it\u2019s relevancy, it\u2019s quick return on investment and it\u2019s making things better for everybody. And I really truly believe, our purpose is helping people and really making work, work better for people is truly resonating at this critical time in the world\u2019s history. Kirk Materne : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And just one really quick one for Gina. So, Gina, in your cash flow guidance for the full year, have you made any sort of assumptions around sort of invoicing duration changing at all? It sounded like outside of that 20% of the customer base, you haven\u2019t seen any real need to think that way versus trying to get a sense on sort of how you are modeling on that front? Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. As I said earlier, the real issue that we\u2019ve seen, and it hasn\u2019t been tremendous, given that only 20% of our business is with customers in the heavily impacted industries. We are not seeing any real issue with respect to sort of invoicing duration or timing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Maybe just to quickly follow up on the last questions and the earlier one. Gina, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times that 20% is industries most directly impacted by the current crisis, 80% is less impacted. But, as we think about sort of the assumptions feeding into guidance, is the assumption that that impact remains relatively contained in that 20% with relatively little sort of downstream effects on the other 80% of large corporations, or are you assuming that there\u2019s some further disruption? I\u2019m just trying to sort of quantify -- or to the extent that\u2019s possible, just think about what happened if things expand beyond the industries that are currently impacted directly? Gina Mastantuono : So, basically, not only, only 20% of our business in the heavily impacted industries, 80% of our business is Fortune 500. And so, we are not as exposed to smaller SMB type of business. And so, our guide does reflect some lower expectations from what we normally would see our growth on a net new ACV. The bulk of that we believe will come from companies in the more heavily impacted but some as some of these companies still May delay some of their speeding and they look for, we definitely incorporated some of that as well. Jennifer Lowe : And earlier there was the mention that the guidance assumes things continue to stay difficult for a couple more quarters, but also April, there was some positive momentum on the pipeline front, and things like that. And we\u2019re seeing press about industry is starting to reopen maybe a little earlier than had been feared. So, if we think about the sensitivity potentially on the more positive side, what are sort of the KPIs that you\u2019re looking at in your own business to get that forward look on how things are trending? And if we do start to see things open up a bit sooner, does that get us back to sort of what the guys might have been previously or is there going to be just business that you don\u2019t think comes back? How do we frame out what the upside could look like? Gina Mastantuono : No, I think that there\u2019s definitely potential upside, if the economy opens up more broadly sooner, right? We think that and we\u2019ve talked about, we are very well positioned once the economy opened up, digital transformation is more imperative than ever. And our customers are really engaging with us like never before. And so, there certainly would be upside in my eyes, if the market opened up sooner. As you know, we are very, very Q4 weighted, and we\u2019re also within each quarter very last month weighted. So, as we look at the actual conversion of the pipe, we talked about pipeline being stronger than ever. Our current conversion rates are higher than normal. And so, we are very well positioned if the economy opens up more broadly to potentially be in a position to have more opportunity versus the current guidance, if that helps. Jennifer Lowe : Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in and hope you guys all stay healthy. Quick question, Bill, on digital transformation. So, that can mean a lot of things for a lot of people, but also for ServiceNow. Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re kind of tilting your sales approach here in terms of different subgroups, especially in the -- when times are a little bit tougher, people look for a quick ROI, like how have you changed the sales approach over the last few weeks to kind of still do digital transformation, but take advantage of maybe faster projects and faster time to money? And then, Gina, quickly on gross margins this quarter, they were at record levels for subscription. Was anything special in there or what drove that? Bill McDermott : Raimo, I\u2019ll start this off. As you\u2019ll remember from 2008, the world was feeling very good in September of 2008 about things until the crisis hit on the financial level. That was pretty substantial. And that was when cloud solutions that offered OpEx first CapEx and fast time to value really became the ultimate move for the enterprise. Because the power moved across the management team, the CEO basically said, do what you have to do to get the job done, do it on your budget, and CapEx slowed and cloud took over as the pervasive computing theme of the 21st century at that moment. In our case, we\u2019re already a pure play born in the cloud market leader. So, what do you do? We essentially wrote a playbook with five main plays that do what you said, take our platform and our market leading solutions and shape them in a way that gives customers what they need fast. So, digitally scaling your operations quickly and efficiently as an example combines our CSM, our ITSM Pro, and our mobile capabilities and our ITOM capabilities in one out of the box pre-packaged solution that\u2019s ready to run. If you want to reduce your technology debt, we have our SAM, Software Asset Management, the Cloud Insights and application management tool out of the box ready to run. If you want to ensure resilience for your critical business operations, we have governance risk compliance, IT operations and security operations out of the box ready to run. And we do this for the employees. We also do this when you\u2019re building any workflow. So, for the employees, you want the right digital experience from anywhere. You listen to any CEO on the business council calls, and that\u2019s what they want. You need the right digital experience for my people anywhere. So we have the Human Resource Service Delivery Pro, ready to go out of the box. It\u2019s all mobile, and it\u2019s ready to run. And, of course, I talked earlier in my remarks about asset management. You have to get the assets to the people where they\u2019re physically located. And you have to track and trace this stuff as well. Again, out of the box ready to go. And finally, on creating new workflows fast when you need them most, the App Engine is now a soaring component of the ServiceNow Platform. And I think we really kicked off a new awareness for that with our COVID-19 apps. People are like, wow! I can do my own app? And I can do it at mass scale with that kind of speed? Are you kidding? We built them in three days. I had one CEO who was fascinating, said, my goodness! I was trying to do an employee rewards program, because I want to get a great score on Glassdoor. And on ServiceNow, I had a business analyst do it in three days. So, everything we do is super fast, out of the box, ready to go and we align the whole value chain within our company to provide that to customers in a virtual world. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : And on your question with gross margins, we did see higher gross margins in the quarter of about 87%. That was really driven by a greater mix of self-hosted revenue during the quarter. We expect that our guidance for the full year, that\u2019ll be more normalized at 86%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Phil Winslow : Hey. Thanks guys, for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. And above all, glad to hear that all of you are healthy and I hope the same for your families and your team. Bill, question for you first. Obviously, as you mentioned, you\u2019ve seen a lot of downturns like this in past over the course of your career. And frankly you\u2019ve actually sold a lot of different software products, HR, financial, CRM, obviously now ITOM and ITSM. Would you talk to you executives, how you think the focus sort of within these segments has changed and priorities versus maybe a past downturns? And then, I just have one follow-up for you, Gina. Bill McDermott : Phil, I think -- and first of all, thank you for your question and safety and wellness to your family. Please give everybody my best, Phil. Executives today are very keen on digital transformation. You can\u2019t go to any meeting where a CEO among CEOs isn\u2019t in some way trying to digitize their company and trying to make sure that digital transformation is at the top of their to do list because they know, if they\u2019re not digitally transform and their competitors are, they\u2019re going to get wiped out. So, this is where the action is. We\u2019re in the sweet spot. And we don\u2019t have to sort of explain that. Now ServiceNow is hitting the main stage with the biggest companies in tech. And we have a very prized position, because the problem with systems of record and the technologies of the past is they do one thing well in a specific domain. It\u2019s not that that\u2019s unimportant, but those investments have been made. So, the CEOs that I talk to, want us to help make those investments work better. And that\u2019s where the platform of platforms comes in. Because we\u2019re so well positioned to take all the investments they\u2019ve already made and enable them to do what they want done, which is to create workflows and inspire their people and provide outstanding service to their customers. And Phil, one of the big learnings in CRM as an example, the engagement layer has been well-penetrated. We all understand SFA, we all understand marketing, we all understand upsell, cross-sell engagement. But what hasn\u2019t been done so well is mid-office operations, how does a healthcare provider take care of 50 million claims and make sure things are done well for each and every constituent, or it could be making sure on field service level for example, deep analytics and machine learning is applied to understand how things can be corrected remotely. But, when you do have to manage an incident, it\u2019s done with the right person, the right tool set, the right training with the right preparation. So, when they do activate a resolution process, the productivity curve goes way up the customer satisfaction, loyalty effect hits. Now, you\u2019ve also seen virtual agent on the platform where we can handle 50 million plus consumers at any one given time on the internet. So, it\u2019s really evolved, and ServiceNow is leading in digital transformation. And workflow is hitting mainstream awareness, which is a new curve for CEOs, and they like it. Phil Winslow : And then, when you think about the sales and marketing line, obviously, we saw a pretty significant jump in headcount this quarter. One of the things that you\u2019ve talked about is needing more distribution for broadening product set. So, I guess to jump off for Bill and Gina, how you think about just headcount there in that line going forward as you balance sort of the long-term growth potential, but also maybe near-term productivity? Bill McDermott : Yes. Maybe what I could do is just start off and then I\u2019ll let Gina pick it up. So, here\u2019s the deal. We have the platform of platforms. You know, we are doing fantastic in ITSM, there\u2019s no question about all the solutions in that portfolio. Employee is taking off like a rocket and continues to grow. Incidentally, we\u2019re very supportive of the systems of record out there. And that\u2019s also helpful to the customer. Because we hide all the complexity and make the user experience great. On CSM, as I mentioned to you, we can handle the engagement layer, the mid-office, or the field service layer, like no one in the market. But, if there\u2019s someone already entrenched in a certain account, we have no quarrel with that. We just make everything that they do work better. And then, there\u2019s of course the App Engine. What I see as our priority is to make sure we align the value chain by industry and persona in every geography, and we go-to-market with tremendous consistency and meticulous attention to detail in the presale sale, post-sale customer support, service and ecosystem. And that motion is completely aligned. And now, I think the virtual environment is the best way to do it at mass scale, quite frankly. I think, we all learned that in this crisis. Now, in the past, we would invent a new product or a new line, and then have to have a specialist sales force to support. I think more and more, we\u2019re going to be able to do that with our core sales professionals, because we\u2019re finding a new level of expertise in pre shaping these things, in training on these things, and aligning the value chain. So, over time, I think we\u2019ll get more done with less, as opposed to every time we want more, we have to add more. And that\u2019s the mentality we\u2019re putting into this. That\u2019s why we\u2019re only hiring 10s maybe 9s that have high potential. Gina? Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Bill. Yes. I would just say that you\u2019re right. We have strong growth in our sales and marketing headcount in Q1. It was the strongest sales hiring quarter ever. And we continue to invest aggressively in our long-term growth in both sales and marketing as well as R&D. I would also say that we\u2019ve also seen strong productivity, which tells us we\u2019re getting good yield on a hiring investment made and affords us the ability to maintain these aggressive targets. So, we feel good, we will continue to invest here and continue to drive the long-term growth trajectory of the business. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Lisa Banks, Vice President of Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Lisa Banks : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ServiceNow\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our second quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2020 and full year of 2020. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this conference call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of July 29, 2020, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impacts of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The forward-looking guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts as we know them today. Many of these assumptions relate to the matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, and the length of our sales cycles, particularly for customers in certain industries. Significant changes in the future could cause us to modify our guidance higher or lower. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and MD&A in our SEC filings, including our 2019 10-K and our 10-Q that will be filed for Q2 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We\u2019d also like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues, net income and remaining performance obligations. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, our investor presentation, and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 2020 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. This COVID environment continues to create challenges for many, and we continue to support our stakeholders, our employees and customers in every way possible. Before getting into our strong results, here are a few trends shaping the overarching environment for ServiceNow. This unprecedented environment is breaking physical supply chains. It is exposing the weak links in the old value chains, illuminating how companies struggle cross-functionally to deliver the workflows that create great experiences for customers, employees and partners. The world is experiencing a seismic shift from the obsolete business process evolution to the new workflow revolution. CXOs are using the Now Platform to create new workflows or new value chains, transforming experiences across siloed systems and functions across the entire enterprise. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for workflow. We are trusted sea suite innovator. We multiply the value of existing technology investments. We deliver exceptional time to value, and our customers understand the business continuity and resilience that the Now Platform enables. Driven by these factors and many others, we couldn't be prouder of our very strong Q2 performance. We beat expectations, beating consensus and guidance and became a $4 billion run rate cloud company. We're raising our topline and operating -- and free cash margin guidance for the full year for 2020, which Gina will provide more detail on shortly. We are delivering safe workplace product innovation in two-week cycles, helping our customers succeed and keeping their employees healthy and safe in these unprecedented times. ServiceNow is a growth company. We are becoming even stronger on our journey to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. We remain totally focused on our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Let me share some additional perspective on how we are supporting customers. CEOs and management teams are focused on protecting revenue, improving productivity and ensuring business resiliency. This has turned digital transformation into a business imperative across all industries. ServiceNow is on the front lines of getting companies reopened. We are helping employees get back to the workplace safely. In May, we launched our safe workplace application suite and dashboard. Our engineering teams continue to deliver product innovations every two weeks. These are real products with an architecture that makes it easy to connect employee health data to their employee badges to ensure safety and security in the workplace. More than 550 organizations worldwide have downloaded our safe workplace suite, companies such as Uber, Coca-Cola European Partners and Bank United are using the apps and dashboard to return to the workplace safely. This is the power of the Now Platform, the ability to move fast, be agile, solve problems quickly with low-code, no-code app development, create new workflows that deliver great experiences. We're helping our customers solve for once in-a-generation challenges, even as they capitalize on the opportunities of digital transformation because we offer one platform, one data model and one architecture. Customers see the Now Platform as a smarter way to workflow. Gina will share our full financial results with you, but here are some highlights from another quarter in which ServiceNow outperformed. Despite the COVID headwinds, we closed 40 deals greater than $1 million in ACV this quarter. We now have 964 customers paying us more than 1 million ACV annually. Our linearity was strong. Our renewal rate remains best-in-class at 97%, demonstrating ServiceNow resilience. Q2 deals underscore the strength of our product portfolio. 18 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. Customer examples include Equifax, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the State of California. Our core business remains ever strong, with continued momentum in ITSM Pro and growth in risk and security, especially as enterprises focus on business continuity. ITSM Pro led eight of the 10 ITSM deals, delivering customers increased automation and operational resiliency. ITSM was included in 17 of the top 20 deals, 15 of the top 20 deals also included security. We did our largest ever risk deal with Providence Health & Services, which has 51 hospitals, 121,000 employees and 800 non-acute facilities. As a heavily regulated business, Providence is partnering with ServiceNow to manage risk, and improve productivity across their business. Employee experience is more relevant than ever. Our HR business now continues to be strong with over 750 customers, in Q2, we had eight deals that were greater than $1 million. For example, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is using ServiceNow to improve efficiency of their HR shared services and to increase employee engagement. They are enhancing employee communications to support their telework initiative. Goldman Sachs, a long time ServiceNow ITSM customer became new HR customer in Q2. They are using our HR products to provide a more consistent employee experience and to drive cost savings. Creating the best experiences and rapidly scaling digital services matter now more than ever. This is driving momentum in our customer service management business. We have more than 50 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV annually. We are delivering great consumer-grade customer experiences powered by industry-specific workflows. Our Zoom partnership is a great customer example. Zoom's usage rocketed 30 times in 4four months. 30x increase. They're now up to 300 million daily meeting participants. ServiceNow CSM solution is enabling Zoom to scale its customer service operations, providing critical communication capabilities for its rapidly expanding global community. CSM also provides proactive case management and personalized self-service options to help Zoom manage the influx of customer requests. We're proud that Zoom chose CSM and the Now Platform to help manage its exponential growth. Zoom also is using our AIOps capabilities to enable its new hardware as a service business model. Thank you, Zoom. Underlying every one of our products is the Now Platform, the platform of platforms. Let me share some examples of how the Now Platform and products translated into strategic customer wins this quarter. A great example is the U.S. State Department. They use the Now Platform to create a dozen apps in just three weeks, tracking COVID requirements for every country on the planet to keep employees traveling safely. With JPMorgan, we closed our largest IT business management and our largest DevOps deal ever. As they consolidate their ITSM, they are improving their employee experiences, leveraging advanced workflows and Intelligent Automation. We're honored that JPMorgan Chase, selected the Now Platform to drive their digital transformation creating great employee experiences and increasing productivity. Fiserv, a global fintech leader, recently completed a merger and need to consolidate systems and processes to gain greater visibility of their assets. Using the Now Platform, they can now gain visibility and insight into the newly combined infrastructure and their emerging dependencies. This reduces time to resolution, improves customer experiences and reduces OpEx, all while proactively providing better services to their customers. We're also now working with the State of Montana to automate their citizen workflows. With COVID, they needed to evolve face-to-face citizen interactions to remote services. They also wanted to reduce the cost and complexity of asset management across multiple agencies, while maintaining data privacy between all of them. It was our ability to provide a single enterprise platform to service all of Montana's agencies that earned us their trust and their business. ServiceNow is partnering with the world's largest brands. Disney is another example of how the Now Platform driving business model innovation. Ann Schmittm VP and CIO of Disney Streaming Services joined me as part of my keynote during our Knowledge 20 experience with the support of ServiceNow CSM workflows, Disney Plus quickly grew to more than 55 million subscribers in just a few months after launch. During the Knowledge keynote, then share has ServiceNow provided Disney. And I quote, 'an extremely flexible and extensible platform that allowed them to develop a best-in-breed customer health center and best-in-breed tooling for their agents to support their customers around the world.' These customer stories and so many others, are why the industry now understands the magic of a Now Platform and the strength of our core business. Top IT analysts firms that named as a leader in three new markets to ServiceNow, CSM, DevOps and Software Asset Management. We also are honored to be named the overall digital innovation award winner by Ventana Research. Every company has had to pivot in this new environment to continue to engage customers in meaningful ways. I am incredibly proud of how our team quickly pivoted knowledge from a four-day physical event that was scheduled to be held in Orlando, to a six-week digital experience that brought ServiceNow community together worldwide. And listen to this. We reached almost twice as many people globally this year when we did at Knowledge 2019. We also delivered more than 820 hours of content, including 1,100 customer-led sessions and breakouts, building a strong pipeline. As our traction continues to grow, our ecosystem continues to strengthen, our partners play a critical role in accelerating customer digital transformation. For example, we recently announced an expanded alliance with Deloitte, to help customers accelerate their HR service delivery efforts, and to provide employees with exceptional digital experiences anywhere. With customer loyalty and our growing ecosystem, we are increasingly part of digital transformation conversations that give us absolute confidence in our business model and our strategic relevance with customers. Our innovation is inspired by solving the needs of customers across geography, industry and persona, as we shape the workflow revolution; our best ideas are ahead of us. Our overarching focus is clear : innovating for customers as we scale ServiceNow to $10 billion and beyond. Our strong management team and our 12,000 employees will enable us to achieve our bold ambitions. To continue driving our growth today, we are announcing the next evolution of our already outstanding go-to-market organization. We are leveraging our tried, true and proven executive talent to continue our strong momentum. Effective immediately, Kevin Haverty is named Chief Revenue Officer, as he continues leading our global sales organization. Kevin has been with the company for nine years and has been leading our sales organization for the last six years. He's owned the number the whole time. Lara Caimi is named to the new role of Chief Customer and Partner Officer, leading all customer success programs and the development of strategic partner activities. She joined ServiceNow in 2017 as Chief Strategy Officer and has led nine acquisitions. They will both report directly to me. I'm really excited. We also recently welcomed Paul Smith, as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our EMEA business, which, by the way, just reached a $1 billion revenue run rate. Joining us from Salesforce, he has a track record for triple-digit growth. Paul is a great example of how ServiceNow is attracting premier talent worldwide. We are fast becoming the employer of choice for our industry's best talent. Before closing, I want to take a moment to honor David Schneider. David has decided to retire at the end of 2020, after a stellar nine years at ServiceNow and more than 35 years in the industry. David Truly has earned the right to step away and began a new personal chapter in his life. David epitomizes our purpose and values. It has been a tremendous honor to work so closely with such a beloved leader. He is ServiceNow family. He always will be, and I wish him the very best in his retirement. David will remain President Emeritus and an adviser to me until the end of the year. In summary, we are ServiceNow strong. In extraordinary times are born extraordinary opportunities. In this once in a lifetime moment, we are at the top of our game. Our people are rising up to seize the opportunities before us. I\u2019m incredibly proud or our culture, our focus, discipline and execution. ServiceNow people have never been more engaged, more focused on serving the enormous names of our customers. Our partners are with us. The ServiceNow ecosystem is truly thriving. Our brand continues to resonate, and we are creating greater awareness and relevance with the C-suite. I constantly hear how people deeply connect to our brand and the humanity of our purpose. Ladies and gentlemen, ServiceNow is special. We're leading the workflow revolution, which leads the future of our business. Now workflows on the Now Platform. The opportunity has never been greater. We will fulfill our purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. We\u2019re hungry, we're humble and we're taking nothing for granted. We\u2019re on the move to our destiny to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Thank you very much for your time and attention today. I look forward to your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Gina. Gina? Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter for ServiceNow despite the macroeconomic headwinds created by COVID-19. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, while continuing to drive margin expansion and very healthy free cash flow. Q2 subscription revenues were $1.016 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth, making ServiceNow a $4 billion revenue run rate company, a milestone on our way towards $10 billion. Q2 subscription billings were $1.018 billion, representing 26% year-over-year adjusted growth, driven by solid execution from our sales team. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $7 billion, representing 31% year-over-year constant currency growth. And current RPO was approximately $3.5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. Top line strength in the quarter was driven by continued expansion of our existing customers. Our best-in-class renewal rate remained at 97%, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customer\u2019s operations. Our sales teams continue to win large deals in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we closed 40 deals greater than $1 million in ACV, an increase from Q1. What's more, the average size of those deals was bigger than any quarter over the past year, and Q2 was our first quarter in which we closed two deals over $10 million, all during a challenging time for our customers. Turning to profitability. Q2 operating margin was 28%, up over 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by our subscription revenue outperformance, as well as lower expenses due to COVID, including approximately two points of savings of Knowledge 2020 moving to a digital-only format. Our free cash flow margin was 24%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong operating margin expansion, partially offset by higher CapEx and an increase in DSOs. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profit. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business. The highly affected industries we outlined in Q1, which represent about 20% of our business and include areas such as transportation, hospitality, retail and energy continue to hold up well in Q2 as renewals of existing customers remain strong. We also closed big deals in spite of the macro headwinds these enterprises face. Now more than ever, they recognize the importance of digital transformation and the quick time to value ServiceNow can deliver. We closed five deals over $1 million from verticals, including oil and gas, transportation and health care. We also won a large security deal with a U.S. based multinational hotel chain, a customer and one of the most impacted industries. As Bill mentioned, the workflow revolution is underway, and we've adapted our go-to-market playbook to focus on the things that matter most to our customers. When speaking with customers, they recognize the strategic relevance of Now workflows on the Now Platform, one platform, one data model and one architecture. This has kept our pipeline generation very healthy. Our coverage ratio today is better than at the same time last year, giving us high confidence in the second half of the year. The great thing about our business model is that it is resilient and predictable. We have a robust backlog, and we generate 80% of our new business from existing customers that understand ServiceNow is mission-critical. With these attributes and our visibility into the pipeline, we feel confident executing our plans. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year 2020. We are raising our subscription revenues range to between $4.185 billion and $4.2 billion, representing approximately 29% to 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. This range reflects $18 million tailwind from foreign exchange versus our previous guidance. We are raising our subscription billings range to between $4.66 billion and $4.7 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year adjusted growth. This range reflects a $22 million tailwind from foreign exchange versus our previous guidance. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%, and we are raising our full year 2020 operating margin from 23% to 24%. This reflects additional savings from travel expenses and the transition of our Q4 Now at work events moving to digital experiences. Many of our learnings from working remotely will have lasting effects on our overall efficiency, giving us the agility to redeploy savings elsewhere. Importantly, we are a growth company with a lot of runway ahead of us. As we continue to feel confident about the long-term opportunity in path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond, we will continue to invest in strategic areas such as R&D and go-to-market. As always, we will be disciplined as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. Turning to free cash flow. We are raising our full year 2020 free cash flow margin to 29.5%, reflecting the increase in our operating margin, partially offset by a decrease in collections due to expected DSO increases. We remain committed to helping our customers manage through this challenging time. And when required, we've taken measures to provide greater payment flexibility. Turning to Q3. We expect subscription revenues between $1.055 billion and $1.06 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $995 million and $1.015 billion, representing 16% to 18% year-over-year adjusted growth. I would note here that the seasonality of our billings has changed this year due to shifts in the timing of renewals. About $18 million of billings was pulled into Q2 from Q3, and we also expect a proportion of Q3's historical invoicing mix to shift into Q4. I want to be clear, the change in billing seasonality reflects the timing of invoices only, not any changes in the trends of our business. As customers expand their purchases of ServiceNow's products, they often realign the new contract to co-terminate with existing contracts. These changes only affect the timing of our billings and do not impact our revenue expectations. Moving on to profitability. For Q3, we expect a 22% operating margin, which includes some spend that shifted from Q2 to Q3 and increased investment, as we continue to develop pipeline based on the opportunities we are seeing. As a management team, we were very prudent about marketing spend entering into our full first COVID quarter in Q2. However, the outstanding execution we've seen from the team, including the success of Knowledge 2020 as a digital event, has demonstrated our ability to get great returns on our investments. Finally, we expect third quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 199 million and 198 million, respectively. In summary, as we continue to navigate through this unprecedented operating environment, a few things have become clear. Digital transformation is accelerating as companies react to unexpected disruptions and reimagine the future of their business. ServiceNow is the strategic workflow authority at the epicenter of this digital transformation. Customers need us more now than ever, and the organization is galvanized to deliver. The power of the Now Platform has become self-evident to customers. Our customers are innovating on the Now Platform to meet their crisis management, business continuity and productivity needs. We have a world-class management team and the right product portfolio to weather the short-term COVID challenges. We will continue to help our customers evolve, and we'll emerge from this crisis an even stronger and better company. We're in a very strong financial position, exiting Q2 with $7 billion in RPO and E&A strong net cash position of $2.4 billion. We have never been prouder of our employees and their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities. Our Hungry and Humble culture is stronger than ever and we can\u2019t thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, we\u2019d like to now turn over the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Kash Rangan : [Technical Difficulty] for you, Gina and one for you, Bill, if I could. Gina, can you just expand a little bit about the -- on the seasonality of billings? So this is something that ServiceNow has not typically experienced. To your point, your credit, clearly, the CRPO number is rock solid, so is the subscription billings. Just if you could dig a little bit deeper into the emerging seasonality of billings, that would be great. And, Bill, a question for you. Once we come out of this pandemic, what does the demand picture look like for ServiceNow? Are we back to -- in some sense -- some investors are concerned this might be pulling in accelerating spend because of the pandemic, but do you really agree with that and what does the shape of those post-pandemic demand picture look like for ServiceNow? Thank you so much and congratulations. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Kash. So the seasonality of our billings is changing a bit this year due to shifts in the timing of certain renewals. As I talked about in my script, some customers are realigning their new contracts for additional products to co-term with existing contracts. As a result, we expect the proportion of Q3 historical billings mix to now land in Q4. As I also previously mentioned, we saw about $18 million of billings shift out of Q3 and into Q2 due to the timing of renewals. If you add those points back to growth, you'll get a more normalized 20% plus, which puts us at the midpoint of the current consensus. So as again, I want to note, these changes only affect the timing of billings and do not impact revenue expectations or business performance at all. Bill McDermott : And Kash, thank you very much for your question and your very nice comments. Post pandemic, ServiceNow gets even stronger. And the reason for that is our customers have less limitations around them and their businesses. So you should feel very bullish about our company. Our $10 billion aspiration way beyond that. Here's what I see. The platform, the Now Platform is resonating everywhere. The ecosystem looks at it as a cross-platform integration engine, because there are so many siloed systems out there from the 20th century system of record. We don't compete with them, we simply make them better, so they layer in the Now Platform and enable business operations to execute even without having to change and redo their systems of record. So, that\u2019s a big tailwind and the ecosystem all has multi-billion plans around ServiceNow, and there'll even be very large tech companies that will declare that very soon. On ITSM Pro, we're only 15% penetrated cash, and that is absolutely paradigm that will have 100% penetration. Employee experience, the simplicity of the employee experience has become not just a CHRO, but a CEO imperative because the war for talent is only going to get greater, not less. Premium talent is everything. And we're doing just a great job and employee experience, and we make all the other ones that are already there look better. I see companies with one system of record per 1,000 employees and very consistently. And with us, you just take one portal approach to simplify the whole scenario for the employees, especially with a hybrid future work environment, work-from-home or work from the office, work somewhere in between, we own that. And CSM, I mean, look at the Disney example. The Holy Grail has always been direct-to-consumer where a great product company didn't have to split their money through different channels and different routes to market where they could just go direct to their consumer. Look at Disney, how they innovated with Disney+. I think that example, when you think about virtual agents, you think about machine learning and AI, a platform to run your operations that provides a work order and a work flow instantaneously where customer is struggle with an internet order. So they get a subscription, they went to customer and customer happy experience. And then finally, when I think about CSM, it's the hugest TAM. So we're in it to win it. And I think Disney+ is a perfect example of the bright future for the Now Platform. And finally, look at this, Kash, you know this very well, low code, no code edge application. Our customers are building applications in hours and a couple of days, deploying them to, in some cases, 1.5 million employees within two days. That's the kind of rapid prototyping innovation and development that has to be done, and the Now Platform gives them that. These are major transformations in the enterprise, and ServiceNow will be at the forefront of leading this initiative. Kash Rangan : Crystal clear and compelling. Congratulations. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you so much, Kash. Operator : The next question is from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. I'm wondering on the ITSM side and ITSM Pro has been, I think, a success, but maybe we didn't anticipate as much as it's been. I'm wondering where you are in terms of the installed base moving over to ITSM Pro? And how much longer do you see that as a sort of tailwind that you've seen it so far? Thanks. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much for the question, Walter. We're about 15% penetrated in ITSM Pro and more than eight out of 10 customers automatically choose it right out of the gates. So we still have the entire installed base to continue to spread our wings in. And what\u2019s really great about ITSM Pro and all credit to CJ and our great engineering team and brining now all the machine learning, the AI, the operational excellence that comes under Platform and you start to get into the predictive world with business automation, with ServiceNow, so that is going to be a huge tailwind for a long time for us. What I really love about it is it opens up all the other conversations with the employee experience, customer service management, the edge applications and then even innovation on the Now Platform itself. So I believe you should feel very, very, very confident in ITSM Pro and the pipeline is soaring. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thanks, guys. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Walter. Operator : The next question is from Brad Zelnick of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you very much and congrats on the strong quarter. Bill, I recall when you joined ServiceNow, you assured us there'd be no interruption, and you've delivered just that, even in the face of COVID. But we're now seeing a transition in sales leadership at the midpoint of the year. The timing seems a little unusual. And I just wanted to understand, how much of any of the billings timing that we're seeing from Q2, Q3 and Q4, might be related to any transition of roles? And what if anything might change in terms of go-to-market strategy with the new configuration? Thanks. Bill McDermott : Brad, first of all, thank you very much for acknowledging that. I know a lot of people thought I was going to pull up the van with crews that I might have had in another company and start making big changes. I found a great management team here. John Donahoe did a great job; Frank Slootman before him and Fred Luddy built an unbelievable company, and I'm proud to stand on the shoulder of those giants. And as it relates to me personally with this team, I'm not making any changes even now. So David Schneider is a great guy, him and I have a wonderful friendship and he's going to be with me all the way to the end of this year. So after 35 years, nine at ServiceNow, he's had a stellar career, by the way. He's still living, but he really wants to spend time with his family. He has an eight and nine year-old and 35 years on the road has been a lot. And he told me when I first met him that this was something he was interested in. So please know that in a certain sense, we're actually simplifying ServiceNow. Because Kevin Haverty, who's now the Chief Revenue Officer, has been running the number to ServiceNow for six years, and he's the guy. So when you think about our sales, sales operations, the industry go-to-market, Kevin had it, he still has it, and all of his leaders are perfectly held in place. There's no change. The second thing with Lara, as you know, she runs strategy for us, a very accomplished person. I just want to give you maybe a little cheat too because sometimes when you run a strategy, you don't know everything about the person. This is a college basketball player for four years as a starter. So talk about competitive. She led, along with Kevin, the go-to-market for our company. She has 20 years experience with CXO level transformations, and she led our M&A events, and she's been my right-hand on so many strategic issues since I've been here. So now she gets to put the value chain together. So our services business, we align presale, we align sale, we align post sale. We align the ecosystem in a value motion to deliver extreme upside for our customers, and she really gets that with the bane background and her experience at ServiceNow. She, too, is a tried, true and proven leader that I was fortunate enough to get to work with when I came here. So no change. The only thing that's mildly different is at the end of the year, David is going to pursue his retirement, spend a little bit more time with his family. But in the meantime, he's right by my side. He'll be focused on sponsoring large customers and mentoring Kevin and Lara for anything that they need. And, obviously, our culture is on fire. Our Net Promoter Score with the customer satisfaction, loyalty and our employee satisfaction is an all-time high. Please know, Brad, there is really no disruption here whatsoever. Brad Zelnick : Awesome, Bill. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add also that the management changes have no impact on invoicing or billings, right? Our billings guide for the full year is strong, and we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve it. Brad Zelnick : Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Bill. That\u2019s it for me. Bill McDermott : Thanks a lot, Brad. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Brad. Operator : The next question is from Sterling Auty. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wondered if you could comment in terms of what you experienced geographically? And specifically, looking at the U.S. results, they look more flattish versus the growth in EMEA, was there any driving factor, whether it's government contribution or others that you would point to? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So we had good growth in the Americas. We had good growth in EMEA as well. We were really pleased with our results for Q2, really throughout the region. Really, they all achieved our expectations, which really helped drive the overperformance for all of Q2. Sterling Auty : Great. Thank you. Bill McDermott : And, Sterling, one thing that you may want to know is, EMEA just broke through the $1 billion run rate threshold, which is an exciting achievement. And getting Paul Smith in there to run EMEA, which is a proven enterprise software executive for many, many years in the enterprise space and him leaving a pretty well-known brand to come here, I think, is setting a statement. So we're rock-solid in every single region. We're rock-solid at the top leadership level, and there's nothing but trusted ServiceNow with our customers and our people. Sterling Auty : Makes sense. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Zukin of RBC Capital Markets. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another great quarter. Just a quick one for me. Bill, it does seem like the core buyer in the IT department seems like they've gotten adrenaline shot here from the COVID crisis. I wanted to ask, if you think about your playbook in this environment versus maybe 90 days ago, what's the playbook to take incremental share? And on the pipeline, if you could comment, typically on the federal vertical, what you're seeing there and in the quarter? And then, apologies for the multi-part question, but could you just help us bridge the growth that you're putting up in kind of current RPO and current RPO bookings versus the adjusted subscription billings growth? Bill McDermott : Sure, sure. I'll let Gina give you the RPO numbers right. But look, the reality is this. The CEOs of enterprises around the world are going to be doubling down on their investment in digital transformation. They recognized in a pre-COVID world that you had to transform, but in a post-COVID world, you have to be digital to survive. I mean just think about it. Your employees have to actually work from anywhere now, if not all the way from home for quite a while. So digital transformation has hit everybody home, nine out of 10 CEOs have a digital-first strategy, yet only four out of those 10 say I'm ready for digital disruption. In other words, if somebody comes out their company with a digital playbook that's better than theirs. They don't feel ready for that. So this is playing right into the hand of ServiceNow. What's interesting is the ITSM backbone to really be the thought leader in IT in that strategic authority; it carries over to the employee experience. It carries over to the customer service management side, and also in edge applications. Take a great company like Lowe's. In the heart of COVID, they had to basically -- they deal with leave requests with their employees, how do I build an application in less than 96 hours and deploy it to 323,000 people? Well, you do it on a low-code platform like the Now Platform and you get it out there. So you're seeing everything come together now to ServiceNow, because we're a platform company. And I think that's the big breakthrough that all of our shareholders should realize because that platform now, if you talk to Microsoft, it's one of the top six strategic platforms for Microsoft. If you talk to any one of the big six systems integrators, it's one of their top platforms. Now people are realizing, my goodness, the 20th century architectures are too slow in these digital-first environments. How do I get fast? How do I get speed? And that's where the workflow revolution is hitting its stride, because behind every great employee or customer experience is a great workflow. And if you listen to my comments today, it's also security. Because now we have to take the worker and match the IT badge with their rights and privileges and their safety protocols around coming back to the office or having to be quarantine, or allowing their teammates to understand the dynamics of who's in and who's out. This is also happening in professional sports where we're highly involved as well. So all of these forces and more are saying platform companies win in a digital transformation environment, especially if they're born in the cloud. Gina Mastantuono : And on your question with respect to the RPO, and thank you for noticing such strong growth in our -- both our RPO and our current RPO. The difference in the billings schedule, right, so invoicing schedule will impact billings, but it will not impact our RPO. So this goes back to the comment that I made earlier, that the changes in the invoicing and billing are just timing related and do not impact our revenue expectations or our business performance. And so this is why billings is not always the best indicator. It's just timing and the core of our business remains ever strong. Bill McDermott : So please, admin, not content and business, okay? Admin. We added handled billings and revenue are fine, margin, free cash flow, growth, everything where you wanted it. Alex Zukin : Thank you guys. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question is from Gregg Moskowitz, Mizuho Securities. Gregg Moskowitz : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats as well on a very good quarter. So it was impressive to see the mix of business from Now Platform on another rise to 13% of total this quarter. And Bill, you talked about the power of low-code, no-code. Are you seeing broader-based adoption of the Now Platform? Or was it significantly influenced by those eight figure deals? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you're seeing clear signs of growing trend here. Thanks. Bill McDermott : It's absolutely a growing trend. If you \u2013 one of the examples I gave was the U.S. state department. Think about this, they use the Now Platform to create a dozen applications in three weeks tracking COVID for every country around the world. If you think about customers like Petrobras, a global energy conglomerate and Brazil's largest company, by the way. They are using the Now Platform to lead their digital transformation strategy. So it is clear that this idea of internal business process on an end-to-end basis has moved from a system of record idea because they realize the data gets trapped in a solo and a silo to streamlining things in a workflow. So this is how people are looking at product development now. This is how they're looking at process innovation. This is how they're thinking about reducing time from discovery all the way through to actually getting products and services to market. So I really believe we're onto something here, and we're at the forefront of the early days of the workflow revolution. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. And I would just add to that, the launch of our state workplace applications. Goodness. This product was designed and launched in just a matter of weeks. And in the quarter, we saw over 30 deals closed. Now that's product innovation, incredible sales execution and quick time to value-added best. So again, really, really strong traction here. Bill McDermott : And if I could build on that, Gina, is absolutely right. I want you to know something. We referenced a few names in my comments today. And in all cases, we went against some other people out there that have heavily marketed their brands and their offerings. And why did the customers choose us? They said because you actually have a real product. It's not a prototype. It's not an idea. It's a product. And incidentally, when Uber actually implemented it in less than two weeks, they were stunned and I was very proud to have them talk about that success at our Board meeting the other day. So what you're seeing now is people realizing the difference between marketing and prototypes versus real products and scale. Gregg Moskowitz : Very helpful. Thanks for the color guys. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Two questions for Bill. Bill, obviously, another strong quarter in sales and marketing hiring. Wonder if you could provide us some color on just what you're seeing in terms of just pipeline build from some of these new hires? And then what is sort of the \u2013 just that strong hiring mean in terms of your confidence for the second half and next year? And then just one follow-up to that. Bill McDermott : Yes, Phil. It's a great question. What we have done, which is very interesting. If you look at it, we've actually increased the size of the workforce 20%, and we powered right through the first half of the year in the midst of a COVID environment. So we have the feet on the street. We have everyone through shark camp, which is what we call our training camp here. And we also have 323 summer interns that are early adopters to the ServiceNow brands who want to join the company. So we're hiring young, brilliant inspired people to be part of the movement. And right now, we have enough feet on the street to actually achieve our goals, and we're looking at everything, Gina and I, when we go through the math, a year in advance to make sure we have the bandwidth. We're also making sure we invest properly in our engineering strength. And I want to basically say, between engineering and go-to-market, there's nobody that can do it any better than us. So we really are looking at our own ideas, our own ability to invent and then having the capacity on the street and then the marketing savvy and the brand reach to get to people, not just in the Americas but all around the world to get them on the ServiceNow train. So we're ready, and we're going to keep building the machine. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add to that. With respect to our pipeline, our coverage ratio today is better than at the same time this time last year. And so from a confidence in our guide for the back half, as I said in my prepared remarks and Bill did as well, we're highly confident in our guide and our ability to execute in the back half of the year. Phil Winslow : Got it. And then just a follow up for you in terms of just the HR. Obviously, you called out a lot of wins in terms of return to work. And obviously, our checks have said a similar thing. How are you thinking about how the return to work impacted the Q2 results, but also the second half? Not just simply, sort of, as an add-on to existing HR service delivery customers, but has a potential to actually drive HR service delivery business? Bill McDermott : I think the idea there is, the 550 downloads, the 30 wins that Gina talked, proving that we are head over heels better than the offerings and the alternative scenario with other people in the market. We know that. So now it's just a question of how much upside can we get in the back end of the year. It didn\u2019t materially impact this quarter. Its upside, but it's not material. But in the future, I think if you look at employee experience as a holistic part of our business model. You take the core employee experience and now the return to work suite, and there'll always to be the next new innovation on top. But what I'm impressed with, Phil, is every two weeks, we have new releases that keep up with the ever-changing market dynamic. There's two things that are going on here that I really want you to register. Number one, the architecture that others have cannot innovate in two-week cycles and deploy with customers and get big companies running within \u2013 and fully deployed within two weeks. Architecturally, through various things of M&A and other things, they don\u2019t have the clean platform that we have. And secondly, our engineering team, because the Now Platform is so simple, it can iterate on this platform so quickly. So we actually got the whole suite out the door in two weeks. The emergency response apps in March were done in three days, deployed in a week. So that is the difference, the time to market. And so, I would like the shareholders to understand that, that is upside, but not required to deliver the dream that Gina and I laid out. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add also that our legacy HR is performing extremely well as well. At the end of the day, employee experience is more relevant than ever. And the C-suite budgets are shifting really to drive better employee experiences. We closed eight deals over $1 million in HR in the quarter and HR was included in 14 of the top 20 deals. We now have over 750 customers. And Bill spoke about the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Goldman Sachs in his prepared remarks. But another win we're proud of is with a multinational pharmaceutical company, who really should -- now to consolidate all of their systems into one portal, to reduce the complexity, because employee drives more self-service and really streamline and automate broken processes. So you're absolutely right. HR is definitely on the forefront of all C-suite executives today. Phil Winslow : Great. Thanks. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Phil. Operator : And your next question is from Chris Merwin. Chris Merwin : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the software asset management product. I imagine that's particularly relevant these days with many companies burdened with a lot of tech debt and looking to digitally transform. So can you talk about any, I guess, any updates there and how significant a contributor that might be to ACV going forward? Thank you. Bill McDermott : Sure, sure. Thank you very much for the question. I appreciate it, Chris. As you know, the environment is right for this. There are enormous opportunities with underutilized software assets, lots of shelf ware. And obviously, this also is true in the hardware business and our product addresses both of that. What I would say to you is the rating that I gave you in my remarks; the independent research companies now have claimed us as a leader in the space. And the pipeline in this area is extremely good. Customers have activated us in all the scenarios that I have personally been involved in, they are looking at us in multiple ways. So typically, the software asset management is coupled with ITSM Pro and some other pieces, but it clearly will grow faster in the second half and beyond because of the leg work that we did in the first half, especially now bringing hardware asset management to market, so we can take a holistic look at both the hardware and the software, and both of those products have been raised by the independent researchers as a leader. Chris Merwin : Great. Thanks so much. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Tom [Technical Difficulty] Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I really appreciate it. Great job on a successful quarter. Bill, I was hoping you could just take a second and address the security product in a little bit more detail. Certainly seems like that is coming up right in the middle of a lot of your strategic deals right now, and security of course is right at the heart of digital transformation. Talk a little bit more about how that's progressing in the pipeline? Who you're facing off against competitively there, and how you're trying to structure these deals? What are the typical sizes of the security deals right now? Thanks. Bill McDermott : Yeah, sure, of course. Thank you very much for the question, I definitely appreciate it. In terms of our quarter, if you look at it, we had our largest security quarter ever for the company. Security was included in 15 of the top 20 deals. I spoke about Fiserv and JPMorgan, which incidentally, I can speak to with authorities since I was the executive sponsor for both of those great businesses. Another example would be a very large defense contractor that worked with us, they saw a tremendous value in an automated approach to security risk and vulnerability response and all on the Now Platform. So I think what you should take away from this is we don't go in there competing with people. We don't actually compete with anybody. We don't talk badly about system of record. We have no problem with any brands that are in market or any particular security company. What they seem to like the most is as they think about streamlining and automating their workflow, they like to have all of it on a Now Platform. So these are very smooth attach rate deals for us, because it's all in the workflow. And the companies like JPMorgan, for example, as you know, have beautifully run company's extraordinary IT talent, and they really like to combine everything that they do in the workflow itself. One example of a company that I was personally involved in it's as simple as this, an employee comes into a building, they have a batch. That badge is best understood by the ITSM Pro. Anything concerning that employee, for example, their rights and privileges, their office access, their computer access, we know everything about them. But also, we know everything about vulnerabilities and responses and attacks that might be coming into the company as well. And as you know, early detection is a whole key to solving these security problems before they get out of control. All of this is mastered in the Now Platform. So think of us as a platform company, think of this as workflow and everything as a business process or workflow in these companies has to be highly secure. And including the return to workplace that Gina was just talking about, I mean, half of the competitive advantage that we bring is knowing everything about the talent, their rights, privileges and what they should and shouldn't be doing. And that has been a big differentiator. That's why I think the IT backbone of our platform is a huge advantage. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, really helpful. Thank you, Bill. Appreciate it. Bill McDermott : Thank you so much. Operator : And we have time for one more question. Your last question is from Sarah Hindlian-Bowler of Macquarie Capital. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: Hi, there. Thank you for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Good to hear your voices Bill and Gina and congrats on another great quarter. The CRPo growth is really something to marvel at. Bill, I think one question that would be really helpful just to kind of hear your perspective on is, if you could look at your sales \u2013 your sales organization, your pipeline, your closure rates, do you feel better or worse than you did three months ago? And why? Bill McDermott : I feel much better. I didn't feel bad than I told you that then and promises made, promises kept, but I feel even better now. And the reason why is, I think, people have come to know that the COVID environment is a reality. And this reality is not going away anytime soon, and businesses still have to run. Governments still have to serve their citizens, our partners still have to acclimate in this climate and meet the ever-changing and diverse needs of digital transformation for our customers. So digital business is moving forward. And the digital event we call Knowledge 2020 was double the attendance of the prior year. And I think that tells you that people are looking for content. They're looking for solutions. They need us now more than they ever did before. The other thing that I find very, very interesting is \u2013 can you imagine this, Sarah, being in four continents in a day on Zoom? Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: No, no I can\u2019t. Bill McDermott : Right. We have defied the logic of time and travel because of these modern digital technologies. So as a productive person, I think that all leaders would probably tell you the same thing. If you interviewed 100 CEOs in the business council, I think, 98 would tell you they can be in more places in more time zones than they ever could have imagined in the physical world. So I think the whole world is adopting to this. I'll give you another example. If you look at our engineering team, they have written more code, because we have all the analytics on the code and the productivity for engineer, and it's obviously good code. Everything works here. And then, in terms of the customers using our platform, all of the use rates are sky high, higher than ever before. So this is just telling me that people have adjusted. The shock of March has now become a norm, and business is going on. And that's evident in the pipeline, its evident in the linearity. It's evident in all of the communications I've had with our sales leadership, our industry leadership, our various go-to-market teams, what we're doing in marketing, what we're doing in product marketing. I mean people are amped up here. I mean, my biggest challenge here is telling them, hey, you guys got to take an afternoon off, go take a walk, relax. Because they're really just going full speed. So I believe you should feel very confident in ServiceNow today and very confident in the second half outlook and extremely confident in an inspired workforce to get the job done for our customers, so they can serve their customers. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: Thank you, Bill. That was really helpful. Gina, I\u2019ll follow up with you on our call back. Gina Mastantuono : All right, Sarah. Bill McDermott : Thanks a lot, Sarah. Gina Mastantuono : Good to hear your voice as well. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Be well. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: Thank you Bill McDermott : Thank you, Sarah. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Ms. Lisa Banks, Senior Vice President of Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am. Lisa Banks : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ServiceNow's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our third quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020 and full year of 2020. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of October 28, 2020 and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impacts of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including but not limited to, the timeframes for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on customer's purchasing decisions and the length of our sales cycles, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and MD&A in our SEC filings, including our 2019 10-K and our 10-Q that will be filed for Q3 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We also like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income and remaining performance obligations. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, our investor presentation and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 earnings call. I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. We continue to be ServiceNow strong in support of our employees and communities in these challenging times. We also remain passionately focused on delivering for our customers, partners and shareholders. 2020 has brought unimaginable change to the world. Companies have to operate in new and faster ways, pivoting their business models. Everyone is adapting to new employee and customer expectations. It's all about people. Getting teams to collaborate across the enterprise is now more important than ever. The workplace of the future will be distributed. Managing complex digital workflows will be critical. Enterprises need innovation without disruption. It's clear that speed has become the differentiator. ServiceNow is leading this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make work better for people. And this is what we're seeing. All value chains are being split apart. They are being reformed into modern digital workflows across the enterprise. More than $3 trillion have been invested in digital transformation initiatives. But as IDC research shows us, only 26% of the investments have delivered meaningful ROI. Massive investments is simply not creating massive change. This is fueling the workflow revolution. The missing link is integration. Systems, silos, departments and processes must come together into holistic cross enterprise workflows. The Now Platform unlocks this ROI by offering speed, agility and resilience. Companies need it now. It gives companies the ability to deliver at scale the experiences employees and customers demand. That's the power of the Now Platform, a single architecture and data model that serves the enterprise platform or all other platforms. In other words, it's the platform of digital business. As one CIO said to me, \"My goal with the Now Platform is to enable my colleagues to perform their top 50 tasks in a single environment that provides a consumer like experience.\" The momentum of the workflow revolution is unstoppable. Despite the COVID operating environment, our team delivered outstanding Q3 results. Gina will provide the details. Here are the headlines. We beat expectations across the board. We surpassed 1,000 customers with ACV over $1 million. We landed our largest deal ever with our largest customer, who has now crossed over $40 million in ACV, and we are raising full year guidance today. We're driving sustainable growth well on our way to $10 billion and beyond. I'm incredibly proud of our team. In the most challenging of times, we are focused, disciplined, committed to helping our customers succeed above other priorities. The speed at which we're innovating has never been faster. Our team is leading the future of work. We are releasing new innovations every two weeks with our Safe Workplace Suite, to help our customers safely return their employees back to the workplace. Other new product introductions include hardware asset management, financial services operations, telecom service management, legal service delivery, workplace service delivery and connected operations. I could go on. In addition, our platform innovations are differentiated for the direct-to-consumer industry where subscribers demand flawless customer service. One of the largest streaming services in the world seamlessly upgraded their ServiceNow environment this past weekend with zero downtime. There was no impact to any of their active subscribers. How's that for customer service? Such innovation demonstrates the power of the Now Platform. We were honored in Q3 to be named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise low code application platforms. We believe this is yet another example of the agility of the Now Platform to help customers quickly workflow any challenge. We think our Gartner recognition validates the breadth of our IT solutions, putting ServiceNow in a leader position in the two 2020 Magic Quadrants, IT risk management and IT Vendor risk management tools. And of course, we remain the leader on both completeness of vision and highest and ability to execute for our ITSM core business - amazing. Now let's look at Q3 performance, highlights across our portfolio. Here we go. Our top 20 deals included three or more products. Our core remains ever strong. ITSM was included in 17 of the top 20 deals with customers choosing ITSM Pro in 16 deals. The embedded AI and machine learning capabilities are helping IT organization scale and automate, reduce complexity, cost and risk, while enabling people to work from anywhere. ITOM was included 18 of the top 20 deals. We won deals with Mount Sinai and the federal Defense Information Systems Agency. Our customer workflows continue to be a growth driver, 13 of the top 20 deals included CSM, 8 of those deals were greater than $1 million. Our customer wins in Q3 demonstrate how ServiceNow is becoming the enterprise workflow standard. For example, Q3 was our largest federal quarter ever. We now have nine federal customers over $10 million in ACV. Deals included the US Air Force, US Army and the US Department of Veteran Affairs. And we have new customer wins with agencies, such as the US Senate and Federal Claims Court. In our largest deal ever, the Department of Veteran Affairs is modernizing its enterprise service management and IT capabilities. They are using the Now Platform to have real-time visibility into the health, availability and costs of their critical business services. This will deliver significant benefits to our heroic veterans. With ITSM Pro, VA will automate its manual workflows with AI and machine learning capabilities to free up employees to better serve veterans. As the US Air Force has publicly described, they are deploying the Now Platform as part of their digital Air Force of the future vision. We are helping them deliver Genius Bar like self-help services to the women and men serving our country around the globe. In addition to federal, state governments also are leveraging the Now Platform. Tennessee's Department of Human Services expanded its relationship with ServiceNow. They're using CSM to reopen state offices for public services while keeping health and safety a priority. They quickly adopted our latest Now Platform, Paris release, utilizing the new feature that enables the public to self schedule appointments and digitally check-in when arriving for appointments. The State of Alaska's Governor issued a directive to protect workers and ensure that the state can continue operating in a pandemic environment. Their existing systems, manual processes and dispersed population created numerous issues to work effectively. The HR department is transitioning to a centralized operating model, and ServiceNow will solve their manual onboarding issues and enable employee workflows to be digitally transformed. Outside of federal and state, and customers across industries, the Now Platform is the standard for driving enterprise digital transformation. 2020 has bought significant changes to Dell's work-from-home model. Our HR product will support this new way of working by providing enterprise onboarding and transitions, and the Now Platform is helping Dell in its mission to provide the best customer experience in the markets they serve. Leading managed services provider, TPX, became the first customer of our new telecom industry specific product. ServiceNow is going to run TPX's customer portal, enabling onboarding, project management, customer servicing and IT support. A major Indian financial institution chose ServiceNow to give them complete visibility to better control enterprise risks, replacing legacy solutions that were stitched together. This is another example of the movement we are seeing in the industry to replace legacy solutions and consolidate on the Now Platform, huge savings. In Q3, we continued to see strong momentum with our Safe Workplace Suite of apps. This quarter we added two new apps into the state Workplace Suite, employee travel safety and health and safety testing. Our Safe Workplace apps demonstrate our ability to innovate quickly and deliver their time to value in weeks, not months and years. We've seen nearly 800 downloads of our Safe Workplace apps. Customers include Standard & Poor's Raymond James and Rutgers University. At Rutgers, our Safe Workplace apps are being used for health screening, contact tracing and room reservations, to ensure a safe environment for all students and faculty. Here is my favorite customer win. I'm a huge basket ball fan, as many of you know, my grandfather Bobby McDermott was a Hall of Famer. So I couldn't be more proud of how ServiceNow helped pro basketball have a successful restart season. The NBA and WNBA were able to implement ServiceNow's employee workflows in under a week to manage the complex manual processes associated with restarting. ServiceNow helped league facilitate screening for more than 2,600 lead staff, vendors and guests who entered the NBA and WNBA bubble in Florida and successfully processed more than 13,000 essential documents. Using ServiceNow technology, the league demonstrated that a safe, careful return to professional sports was possible with the right tools and protocols in place. We are very proud to become the official workflow partner of the NBA and WNBA, and we look forward to helping the league continue to drive digital transformation to deliver great employee, player and fan experiences. As we drive great customer wins, our partner ecosystem is growing even stronger. We are grateful for the investments our partners are making to grow their ServiceNow businesses and to serve our customers. We recently announced a go-to-market partnership between IBM and ServiceNow. This new business opportunity combines ServiceNow ITSM and ITOM capabilities with IBM's Watson AIOps to help customers automate IT at scale, reducing cost and risk. Last week, we announced an expanded partnership with Accenture. The new Accenture ServiceNow Business Group will accelerate digital transformation programs for customers in telecom, government, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and life sciences. In summary, Q3 was another great outperformed quarter. ServiceNow is accelerating. We are confident in our ability to succeed in this environment. We are bullish on our long-term outlook and our path to $10 billion and beyond. Our leadership has expanded our reach and opportunities with marquee partnerships such as the NBA and WNBA, IBM and Accenture. There are many more. Our brand is resonating. We are becoming an essential C-suite strategic partner. Our ecosystem is growing fast. Our go-to-market capabilities are stronger than ever. Our product innovation is second to none. We are deeply committed to attracting, retaining and developing the best talent in this industry. We are a big tent company dedicated to diversity, inclusion and belonging. Diversity makes us stronger, making ServiceNow the destination company where the best talent belongs and thrives. And this is what's going to make us unstoppable. Our new Board member and new Chief Global Talent Officer were announced today, and it demonstrates the caliber of people we are attracting. I could not be more thrilled to have Larry Jackson joining our board and Gaby Toledano joining our leadership team. Both are exceptional leaders. Larry is leading a music industry revolution for Apple Music. His experience using technology to create innovative market leading consumer experiences will be invaluable as we drive innovative employee and customer experiences to the global marketplace. Likewise, Gaby brings deep-tech industry and talent leadership experience building world-class organizations at scale for some of the best-known companies in the world. We were humbled to recently be recognized as the company with the best leadership team in an anonymous survey of more than 10,000 employees across the industry. Gaby is a great addition who will only make us stronger. In so many ways, we are just getting started. This year's unprecedented headwinds have only strengthened our digital transformation tailwinds. We have the platform businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation, the missing link for integration of existing technology investments and the creation of modern enterprise workflows. Remember, behind every great experience is a great workflow. Whatever challenge a business is facing, we workflow it, we will make workflow a verb. ServiceNow is incredibly well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We will not slow down in pursuit of this goal. We couldn't be more fired up to finish this year very strong. And now I will turn the call over to our outstanding CFO, and my friend, Gina. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q3 was a fantastic quarter for ServiceNow as the team continued to execute very well despite the challenges created by COVID-19. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, and that top line beat carried through to a robust operating margin and strong free cash flow generation. Q3 subscription revenues were $1.091 billion, representing 29% year-over-year constant currency growth. Q3 subscription billings were $1.081 billion, representing 24% year-over-year adjusted growth, driven by the great execution from our sales team. Remaining performance obligations or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $7.3 billion, representing 28% year-over-year constant currency growth, and current RPO was approximately $3.8 billion, representing 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. Our top-line strength demonstrates the power of our product portfolio and our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers. The Now Platform is uniquely positioned to deliver exceptional time to value and provide workflows that create great experiences for customers, employees, and partners. We are solving customer's challenges and playing a key role in accelerating their digital transformation. The Now Platform enables the missing integrations that links together system, silos, departments, and processes into unified workflows. Our best-in-class renewal rate improved quarter-over-quarter to 98%, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers operations. As Bill highlighted, our sales teams continue to win bigger deals in Q3, including our largest ever $13 million ACV deal. We closed 41 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter. And what's more, nine of those are with net new customers. Our ability to land new logos despite the macro uncertainty that COVID has introduced is a testament to our amazing products and our brand that continues to resonate with the C-suite. We now have over 1,000 customers paying us more than $1 million of ACV. Turning to profitability, Q3 operating margin was 26%, a 400 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance, lower T&E expenses as a result of COVID and about 150 basis points of marketing spend that shifted from Q3 into Q4. Year-over-year, our Q3 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental investments in R&D and marketing spend of pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 19%, up 500 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and CapEx in the quarter as well as strong collections. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the trends we are seeing in our business. Overall, we see strong momentum heading into the last quarter of the year. The highly affected industries we outlined earlier in the year, which represented about 20% of our business and include areas such as transportation, hospitality, retail and energy, continue to see macro headwinds, but remain steady customers of ServiceNow. We closed six new deals over $1 million in these affected industries. And while we do expect some headwinds in severely impacted industries like airlines, renewals of existing customers have remained very strong. Furthermore, we've also seen very healthy payment terms and DSOs. Collections have been strong, helping drive free cash flow upside in Q3, and we expect that trend to continue into Q4. Enterprises are realizing that they need to quickly adapt to the workplace of the future, and ServiceNow is providing a smarter and faster way to workflow. Our pipeline generation has remained robust, and our pipeline coverage ratio for the remainder of the year gives us confidence in our ability to deliver a strong finish to 2020. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We are raising our subscription revenues range to between $4.257 billion and $4.262 billion, representing 31% year-over-year constant currency growth. We are raising our subscription billings range to between $4.78 billion and $4.8 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year adjusted growth. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%, and we are raising our full-year 2020 operating margin from 24% to 24.5%. This reflects additional savings from lower T&E expenses related to COVID. Let me note that while we expect many of these expenses to return at some point in the future, we're taking our learnings from the current environment and leaning into the future of work. These learnings will have lasting effects on our overall efficiency, giving us the ability to redeploy savings elsewhere. We plan to take advantage of the incremental leverage and make disciplined investments for growth. We're reinvesting in R&D and quota bearing resources to drive innovation and pipelines that fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration heading into 2021 and beyond. Turning to free cash. We are raising our full-year 2020 free cash flow margin 200 basis points from 29.5% to 31.5%, reflecting the increase in our operating margin and our expectations for better than originally forecasted collections for the year. Turning to Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.155 billion and $1.160 billion, representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $1.625 billion and $1.645 billion, representing 24% to 26% year-over-year adjusted growth Moving on to profitability. For Q4, we expect a 21% operating margin, which includes about 150 basis points of marketing spend that shifted from Q3 into Q4 and some incremental investment into pipeline generating activities to set us up for a strong and successful 2021. Finally, we expect fourth quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 201 million and 199 million respectively. In summary, ServiceNow is the strategic workflow authority. As enterprises are adapting to the workplace of the future, CXO's are using the Now Platform to create new workflows for new value chains, transforming experiences across siloed systems and functions across the enterprise. The Now Platform is the missing integration layer that multiplies the power of enterprises existing technology investments and delivers exceptional time to value. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance as we focus on addressing these needs for our customers. Our ecosystem partners are efficiently expanding our capabilities and our reach, and more and more enterprises are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model and its ability to deliver great scalable experiences with speed and efficiency. We are the platform company for digital business. I'm very excited about the traction we are seeing in our journey towards becoming a $10 billion revenue company and the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for your dedication during these trying times. We know everyone has a lot going on in their lives, juggling work and caring for your families at home, and we just want to express how appreciative we are of your contributions. ServiceNow wouldn't be in the position of strength it is without each and every one of you. You make us ServiceNow. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Bill, a slightly bigger picture question. Now that we are living in this normal environment of kind of working from home, demand generation in a different way than we had before, what lessons have you learned so far in terms of like how this new world is going to function now in terms of you planning for the coming years in terms of sales hiring, lead generation, etc.? Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, I appreciate it, Raimo. First of all, we're learning that digital transformation is actually accelerating in the COVID environment. It is however a platform game. So you need to have the platform that can truly make the difference. And we see workflow as the new productivity unlock. When you look at IDC, talking about where it's thoroughly invested and system of record kind of change. You see system of action taking on a whole new meaning now in the information technology industry, which puts us in a very nice position in any environment. So I think what happens here is COVID accelerated digital transformation. Now that people are into it, they've got to keep going as fast as they possibly can. Our direct sales force is every bit as relevant as ever before, and we are continuing to make sure the coverage model expands geographically by industry and also persona. You can also complement this very nicely with an inside selling motion to both support existing accounts and pursue net new logos. You're going to be in an environment where you can do events. These events do not have to be done in big stadiums with thousands of people. You can do them digitally and have techniques where you bring live experiences into the event. That also gives a growth company like ServiceNow the ability to take some of that T&E and put it into revenue strategies for future growth. So we're super excited super, super confident about our ability to execute in this environment, because as you know, Raimo, the future of work is now totally different than it was eight months ago. And thank goodness we leaned into that when we did in March and started a revolution. Operator : Your next question is from Samad Samana. Samad Samana : Bill, I wanted to maybe touch on the federal strength and even the state and local governments. It seems like you're seeing an acceleration in transformation there as well. And I'm curious how much of the strength there was driven by modernizing existing processes or old processes versus kind of near-term pandemic driven spend on dealing with like monitoring PP&E or contact tracing, etc.? Bill McDermott : Yes, I believe, you know, as I said, what happened with digital transformation might have been accelerated by COVID. But the fact is, I think it brought everything to light. When people had to work in a distributed way, work from home, all of the technology needs that they have, the communications needs that they have, the self-service needs that they have, all of these things became extremely clear in a COVID environment. And now that that environment is clear, if you read the research, clearly we're never going to go back to the way things were even after the pandemic is resolved. So the future of work is changing. The millennial generation is changing. The way people work will change. And as it relates to the federal government, it's a big opportunity because the information that's required to get across the country to citizens is very slow. So the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing digital services. So these workflow services are going to be here for a long time because there's a lot of things to fix. So we are in a - in an environment now where I think the genie is out of the bottle. It's never going back in, and digital transformation is going to continue to accelerate. And yes, we do have return to work, but that hasn't been the major source of the revenue drive in federal, state and local, it's really been more automating and rethinking work processes and automating everything in a much more human-friendly way. Operator : Your next question is from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Bill, I was just wondering if you could give us some idea of when you're going into these big deals, you obviously - the economic backdrop is still choppy. So your customers are having to make decisions about maybe bringing budgets from other areas and sort of giving it to you or allowing you to earn it, I guess. What's going on in those conversations? Are you taking budget from other areas - from other vendors? Is this - are these dollars that used to be spent on more antiquated business processes that you are now able to sort of pull together? Yes, I'm just trying to get a sense, because if you take a larger view of what's going on, obviously this is still a difficult economic backdrop. But you all are clearly taking wallet share and just would love some more color on that. Thanks. Bill McDermott : It's my pleasure. So the bottom line, Kirk, if you think about it, the future of work in terms of the employee experience. It's clear now that one portal that can provide all the services that employees need, from on-boarding on an employee to self-serving all of their cases to training them and creating a segment of one learning journey for them, to managing issues that might resolve - that might come up and need to be resolved across multiple functions. All of these things are workflow related. So I think the future of work has truly accelerated the consumer strength of our application because it's so easy to use. It's so beautiful to use, people love it. And we hide all the complexity of what's been created over the last half-century. In terms of the customer experience, the customers today, especially in the digital world, expect companies to give them great service. And the kind of the SFA of the past, how do I upsell and cross sell you, they're not in a good mood for that. What they really want is they want you to give them a great service in terms of whatever they signed up for and then make all the self-help tools available to them and use AI to automate the experience. And then if you do need human intervention, the workflow process itself should initiate a call order to a bot or to a human to resolve something so that the customer gets what they want, and they get a digitally. And you know Netflix taught us this. Disney+ taught us this. This is the new way that customers want to work, and they're not in a mood for an up-sell or a cross-sell when they're calling it to have a problem resolved or they are trying to get a service initiated. And similarly, big companies have a direct-to-consumer headset, right now. It's kind of like, hey, the middle people I used to work through, wholesalers, retailers, etc. aren't open. So I've got to go direct to my consumer with my brand and my product and create a great experience. All of this is workflow. So the changes in the future work are going to be there. But then you could take a large bank. I had a CIO extraordinaire in with our Board, and she talked about retiring 283 legacy applications and converging them all on the Now Platform. And there's a list of another 100, and she basically told a great story about literally thousands of people working from everywhere and getting them all their tools and procedures and allowing them to navigate in this world on their own in a way that's highly pleasing to them because they want to drive productivity with their workforce. They also want to mitigate risk and have controls in place, so the place is run well. And everything now is just running so much better. They took out all these 283 systems, and they delivered like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars by application that they retired. And when you add it all up, it's in the triple-digit millions. So they are saving huge money. Operator : And your next question is from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Karl Keirstead : Maybe I'll direct this one to Gina. Gina, on the margin improvement trajectory, it seems like there is a band we should be thinking about. Maybe at the low end, the pre-COVID rate, at which ServiceNow was improving margins at about 100 basis points a year and perhaps at the high end, the roughly 300 basis points that you're going to put up in 2020 which is probably somewhat unsustainable. I wanted to ask whether your comments about upticking investments was intended to perhaps push us to one end of that spectrum. I'm not asking for firm guidance. I know that will probably come later, but just directionally maybe how this experience with COVID and the cost structure has changed, if at all, your view of ServiceNow's margin improvement story? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So thanks for the question Carl. It's a great question, and I was trying to give some - I was trying to elaborate here, right, so the 300 basis point of margin improvement that you're seeing this year as you said it is not sustainable, right. Some of these costs will return and what we wanted to say is that not all of them will at the same level. Right. And so we absolutely will be leaning into the future of work and what that means from a cost perspective, but we don't plan to just rest on our laurels. And as Bill talked about the acceleration of digital transformation really being at the forefront and really making sure that we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth and really remain market leader, we will absolutely continue to invest to ensure that we are well positioned in the view of that exploration happening. And so more will come on the absolute margin guide. But I wanted to make clear that the 300 basis points is not sustainable, and that certainly some of the learnings and efficiencies that we'll see in a post pandemic world will be redeployed in areas such as R&D and in quota bearing resources to really kick start growth. Karl Keirstead : And if I could ask a follow-up to Bill. Bill it's now been pretty well a year since you were announced as the new CEO of ServiceNow, congrats by the way on that anniversary. And I'm just wondering now that you're getting comfortable in the seat, the execution has been strong. Perhaps, it's time that M&A becomes a bigger lever to move ServiceNow in the direction you'd like. I'd love your thoughts on that. Thank you very much. Bill McDermott : Well, Karl, thank you very much. You know it's been a year. It's been amazing. I love it here, and the workforce, the partners, the customers, the satisfaction, the loyalty, the excitement on Net Promoter Score, everything is just so positive. And the culture here is so committed, and I think that has really jelled very well with my DNA. So I'm just honored to be here and having the time of my life. As it relates to M&A, we have a situation here where the core business - and the core business has so much potential in and of itself, and the platform has so much potential in and of itself. And when you extend that to the employee experience and some of the items I mentioned today and then you also think about the workforce and the workforce of the future and all the experience layers that go along with that and what ServiceNow will do for people and we're going to make people and their lives so much better in the enterprise. Then you think about customer service management and the enormous success we're having with customer service management and the huge TAM of customer service management. We just have so much opportunity organically that you have to think about geographies. You have to think about industries. You have to think about the personas we're going to serve. And when you put it all together, I mean, depending on what research you look at - Morgan Stanley when I first came in here had just taking paper-based processes and enterprises and automating them into workflows was $228 billion in the US. So if you extrapolate that to the world, you could easily get to $400 billion just in that. If you think about the employee experience, the CSM, the core business, now with ML and AI and all the operational efficiencies, so much organically. So I think the tuck-in strategy has worked well for us because we've been able to re-platform all of that code to the Now Platform. We have no tech debt. Many companies who have expanded through acquisition now have a mess on their hands that they're spending engineering time reintegrating them all the time, instead of building that amortization. So we're very thoughtful about what we're doing here and why we're doing it in service to the customers. So long and short of it is, it's an organic growth story. There's plenty of room to grow. The TAM is big, and if we did something on a more sizable scale, we would have very clear guard rails on doing that for the customer's interests and the large expansion opportunity. But we would never take away the experience benefits they're getting from the Now Platform. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Bill, a question for you and then one for Gina. Definitely feel your excitement about the kind of workflow space, but it does seem like there's a lot of other vendors that are trying to converge on this opportunity as well and trying to automate people's workflows and perhaps a different competitive set or environment than ServiceNow has seen historically. Can you give us your perspective on sort of who are the main competitors for the big vision of ServiceNow? Who are the guys that you really are going out there and duking it out with to get those big deals done? Bill McDermott : Keith, that's the amazing thing, you know, we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So if you think about the large system of record providers out there, we have no quarrel with them. Most of the CEOs and technology leaders out there have invested heavily in those platforms. And the last thing they're interested in doing right now is switching out those platforms, especially in a COVID environment where speed, acceleration resiliency and serving customer and employees at the top of their to-do list. So that's not a problem for us. And then if you think about the point solution providers, of course there's always going to be point solution providers running around, but we became the platform standard for workflow automation. And now we've extended the perimeter into the employee and the customer service management areas, which are huge TAMs. Also as Gartner indicated, we're really gaining tremendous traction on the platform itself, where people are building innovation onto the platform. So what I see happening is large companies in the Fortune 2000 are basically taking legacy, and they're putting it on to Now. They're basically saying how can retire my legacy because I can go to ServiceNow, get a consumer grade experience, and I can automate my workflows across domains, systems, silos and give my employees and the customers a great experience. And that's so important to them, they don't even ask about price as much as they ask about how quickly can you get it done. And then when we tell them how quickly we can get it done, they are literally in awe because we're talking weeks. We don't talk in years, and that's a very different language from most large-scale companies. So I would really tell you there is no competitor that we go into these large deals worried about. We're just focused on the customer, getting their business to run and do it well. And then obviously we have all the tools, processes and people in place to show them the value. And we not only show them what's possible, but we manage the value through the life cycle of the relationship at an art form level. And these are plays that have been put into the ServiceNow playbook in the last year that are scaling very, very nicely and the customer can see what they're getting out of the platform, and they like it. Keith Weiss : Got it, got it. And then for Gina, the confidence you guys have in the business, you guys are definitely expressing on the conference call, but also in hiring. If I got my math right, I think head count is up something in the order by 27% on a year-on-year basis. So definitely investing behind this opportunity, two questions for you. One is that level of growth sustainable for ServiceNow on a going-forward basis or should we expect that to moderate? And two, just given the dynamics of the subscription model where revenues kind of follow the trend of subscription billings and billings overall, are there some margin implications to that type of growth that we should be keeping in mind as we think about 2021? Gina Mastantuono : Great question, Keith. So I appreciate it. So, yes, you're right in your numbers. Head count is up significantly. We made the pledge that we were not going to lay off this year in the COVID-environment, and not only that, but we were actually going to continue to grow our headcount pretty aggressively year-over-year, especially in R&D and in sales. And so we have done just that, and we will continue to do that. With respect to trends, we are really focused on hiring 9s and 10s in this organization. And the announcements that we've made on new leadership has been fantastic. And we're really getting high-quality high-caliber talent. People want to come work for ServiceNow, and we are just so thrilled about that. And so, yes, I absolutely believe that this trend will continue that we will grow headcount. From a margin perspective, I said earlier, it's a bit too early to comment on '21. Certainly the 300 basis points that we're seeing this year is not sustainable, and we absolutely will be very focused and disciplined in all our investments, including headcount, to ensure that we're driving the right level of ROI, but at the same time really investing behind growth and innovation. Bill McDermott : Yes, Keith, and one of the things to build on what Gina's saying, we pretty much have so many people trying to work with ServiceNow, and we're very honored by that. But you got to really thread the needle to get in here. So what we're putting into the company is sustainable, and we'd rather have a job open for an extended period of time rather than settle on talent. So we're going to build a great, great company here. The other thing I want to mention to you is the margin profile is also substantiated by revenue per employee. And if you look at our revenue per employee and how it's climbed and how it's climbed against any comparison you can come up with in the enterprise, it's pretty impressive. And Gina and I study that very carefully, and we want to make sure that our shareholders have total visibility into all the things that we're doing. And we also run the whole company on the Now Platform. So we are getting tremendous efficiencies out of that, that are being reinvested into people. And I think that's a big thing, and we're really focused on the engineering pride of the company. We make great, great products, and we provide great service with those products, and the brand obviously is resonating. But in addition to that, where we put the money is on things that will return for the shareholders, so in the form of revenue and sustained revenue, in addition to the margin. So we're really, really focused on the whole P&L right now. Keith Weiss : Yes, ServiceNow's unit economics are really best-in-class. So we definitely take notice of the efficiency with which you guys make those investments and the greater returns so. Great job, guys. Thank you very much. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Keith. Operator : Your next question is from Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : A question for you, Bill, and then a follow-up for Gina. Bill, obviously given your background, scaling go-to-market large application platform companies, now that you've been at ServiceNow for three-plus quarters, how do you think about the opportunity that ServiceNow has not just simply to sell deeper into the organizations, but as you mentioned, you acquire new customers? How do you think about sort of balancing that opportunity? And then, Gina, sort of as follow up that in terms of just go-to-market capacity. Obviously, you've added a lot of go-to-market heads this year, what are you seeing in terms of just ramp of those new heads, especially doing so in a virtual environment? Bill McDermott : Yes, so Phil, I'm really excited to have crossed the year here. We crossed that threshold which is great. In terms of building the go-to-market machine here. It's an outstanding business because the business was built on Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction, and loyalty. And when you have a baseline of very, very happy customers that love the product and are having a great experience, it's a lot easier to scale an organization. So I start with that, in total respect of the great engineering and outstanding go-to-market folks that we have in the company that deeply care about customer satisfaction and loyalty, and that baseline has enabled us to focus. I'd say we're focusing very carefully, Phil, on the Global 2000. We are now geographically expanding in Asia. We also have several places within EMEA that we can expand, and we're on top of that. And we're also segmenting things much more by industry now because as you know, when you have an industry solution it's easily replicated in other parts of the world in and other accounts. So we're very good with large customers getting success and then fast replication of that success. And the value that that delivers is something that's still a tailwind, and there's plenty of room to grow. Furthermore, I do agree that that works especially well in a COVID environment on a same account revenue growth basis. And then there is a whole new motion that we have for the net new logo expansion of the company, and that will nicely complement the direct sales force. So there are several indirect techniques that we're putting into place. And just to let all shareholders know that we're thinking about this stuff in our sleep too, we want to make sure that things that we used to do that, perhaps because of COVID or we came up with a better idea even after COVID, is going to be invested in things that give us growth and do so with high efficiency. So we're covering the board geographically, by industry, by persona. It's a direct game. The focus is on the 2000. But we can also go down market with a lot of self-service techniques and insider techniques that we've yet to fully form, and they are now in place, and we think they'll hit the ground running in '21, Phil. Gina Mastantuono : And then on your second question with respect to sales efficiency and ramp reps, I've been extremely impressed, Phil, with the sales team's ability to close large deals on the move. As we mentioned, we closed 41 deals greater than $1 million in ACVs this quarter. On a sequential basis, we actually saw an improvement in sales productivity, with the most notable uptick coming from North America. Attrition rates remain low, almost at the lowest rates we've seen in quite a long time. And so we're entering into '21 with ramps reps that are significantly higher than at this time last year. So we feel really good about sales productivity, about the ramp reps. And of course ramping new employees in a virtual environment we use the Now Platform. And so our on-boarding platform and product has just been phenomenal, and so the 27% growth that you've seen this year in total heads, we've been onboarding the bulk of those folks remotely in a COVID environment. And it's been flawless. I've actually had a couple hires that were so impressed with how easy it was to onboard. And so really, really proud of the entire team. Operator : Your next question is from Derrick Wood of Cowen & Company. Derrick Wood : And I'll echo my congrats. I guess for Bill or Gina, I know you guys don't disclose net revenue retention rates. But I'm just curious if you look outside of the distressed verticals you talk about how would you characterize how expansion rates have trended this year versus what you saw pre-COVID? And then as a follow-up, as you enter your strongest renewal quarter in Q4, can you talk about the focus and the demand for ITSM Pro and maybe give us a sense as to what inning you think we're in, in terms of penetrating the installed base? Gina Mastantuono : Thanks. Yes. Great, I'll take that. Listen, I think that our expansion rates have been really holding up well, similar to what we've seen pre-COVID, so really strong, happy with what we're seeing, even with respect to the distressed verticals. I talked about those deals greater than $1 million in the year - I'm sorry, in the quarter, holding up really strong. And so we feel really good about expansion rate. We feel really good about even our significance in these distressed verticals, right. We are seeing more upsells than down-sells. And so again, feel really good about that. If you talk about the demand for ITSM Pro, well, it continues to be going well and really strong - we continue to have a strong quarter. In Q3, we had great strength. We saw increases in automation and operational resiliency within the product. As we've talked about before, there's a 25% price uplift from ITSM Pro, and 15% of our customers are using it today. So there's significant runway still ahead of us with respect to the Pro SKU. And so, again in summary, really doing well. Customers are resonating as the AI and ML capabilities that are incremental in the Pro SKU are really resonating right now more than ever as you think about the future of work in this COVID environment. And so still early innings with a lot of runway to go. Bill McDermott : And Derek, one thing to build Gina's commentary on the pipeline. If you look at our pipeline in a snapshot. This time last year our pipeline is up this year versus last year, and even when - if you want to play what-if game, the distressed industry has got harder hit, do you have enough coverage on the conversion side? We have more than enough. So we've already gone through all that, and the retention has been outstanding, including in the distressed industries, and the pipeline overall is substantially strong, and the loyalty actually went up this quarter versus last. So the business is a really good shape. Operator : Your next question is from Brad Zelnick. Brad Zelnick : Excellent, thanks so much for fitting me in. I want to follow up on Keith's question around headcount because I noticed the exception was in professional services. And, Bill, I don't think anyone has the kind of experience and relationships with the global SIs as you do. So can you give us an update on these relationships, the joint investments you're making and the kind of partner leverage that we should expect to see out of the business going forward? Bill McDermott : Yes, this is such a good question. If you think about a partner like EY as an example, if you talk to Carmine - ServiceNow - I met him in Santa Clara year ago on the ServiceNow platform, bringing his whole team. And we were one of the partners. We were one of the companies, and now it's us and Microsoft as his two most strategic global partners. If you think about Accenture, I talked about Julie at Accenture today. Accenture's now opened up a global practice dedicated with complete passion and investment. If you look at IBM, IBM had a very large on-premise, their version of ITSM on-premise legacy. And they've entered into a big partnership with us to actually move that to the ServiceNow cloud. We team up with them on their Watson AIOps, everybody wins. But best of all, now IBM has committed to a large scale ServiceNow practice. And this is also true with all the other signature partners that you're well aware of. So what happened, what has changed? There isn't a single partner out there that doesn't have at least a $1 billion, if not many more billion vision for what they will do with ServiceNow in the very near future. They are all increasing their investment. They're all looking at ServiceNow as a standard for digital transformation, and they all see either ServiceNow as the cross platform integration engine to straighten out the way companies run and also complement their other practices. Or they're looking at it as a pure net new workflow revolution practice on some of the dimensions that Gina and I discussed today. In all cases, it is really getting tremendous tailwind, and it's one of the network effects that I think is coming from building great products, having tremendous engineering pride, and also lining up a company only with customer satisfaction. I mean, that's really what we care about. And the partners have really resonated with that because when you work with ServiceNow, you don't have situations where you're cleaning up product messes, you have situations where ServiceNow complements their practice. It works, everybody is happy with it. How do we scale? That's the conversation. Brad Zelnick : Awesome, Bill. If I could just squeeze one in for Gina. I just wanted to ask about the COVID assumptions that you have baked into the Q4 guide, because if I look at what you were saying a quarter ago, you would assume that the most significant headwinds would occur in Q2 and Q3 and that, as it relates to COVID, and that into Q4 the economy would be opening up more broadly. Now if I look at the Safe Harbor in the deck that you have out there today, it instead says that the assumptions are based on information available to us today. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about - is this in your mind a headwind relative to what your assumptions were a few months ago because we're seeing - I know this is changing and evolving very rapidly, but even today with France shutting down. How are you thinking about this? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, it's a great question. As you know, right, so that the uptick in cases and France closing down is certainly a key - key on all of our minds, right, not just from a business perspective. But what I will say is that as you saw the guide, we're actually raising our guide for Q4. And so we definitely took a cautious approach in our - all of our assumptions back at the end of March, and we continue to refine them as we go. What gives me confidence right now in our current Q4 guide is our pipeline stats, right. The coverage is better than last year. Our close rates are strong. And so we continue to be able to evolve and close deals in this remote environment. And so if you think about where we were back in March, April, May, the whole world basically locked down. We feel confident that we'll be able to really continue to hit our numbers and have a strong close to 2020 and Q4. The team is doing a phenomenal job. Execution is just top rate, and at the end of the day, back to the comments that Bill has made earlier, more and more companies are leaning in and not leaning out because they absolutely have to. And the longer COVID exists - and let's be clear, no one thinks this is going away tomorrow, the more companies have to invest in exactly what ServiceNow is providing. And so again, pipeline looks strong. We feel really good about our Q4 guidance. Operator : And we have time for one last question. Your last question is from Zane Chrane of Bernstein Research. Zane Chrane : Hi, thanks for fitting me in, a little bit of a conceptual question regarding your TAM. I know you've alluded to this in the past, but I get a lot of questions from investors regarding how much is your TAM when you add up the spend on HR versus customer service or IT management, etc.? And it seems like that's maybe not the best way to think about it. Increasingly, it seems like the TAM is a function of how much the employee time - the value of employee time tracking work about work is being wasted in aggregate around the world, compounded with the lost value in sub-optimal business results. When you guys look at that - look at your opportunity in terms of those two variables, assuming that's the correct way to look at it. What do you see as being the size of the opportunity and then which technologies or competitors do you view as being most concerning for as ones you would want to watch on the horizon as a potential threat? Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Yes, I mean it's, it's the interesting question. And if you - if you ask 10 different people what the TAM is you will absolutely get 10 different answers. If you look at what Gartner said when we IPO-ed about what the TAM was for ITSM, it was significantly lower than what it is. I think most people would say the TAM is about $165 billion, but that's not including exactly what you talked about right, the real opportunity to automate manual processes throughout every single organization. It's enormous, it's huge. And if we think about that, I think that - I'm not going to quantify it here, but you all can do your math. It's large, and so we absolutely believe that the acceleration of digital transformation is happening today and that we are going to continue to evolve and innovate to ensure that we remain the market leader. And so from a competition perspective, we talk about this often, we're a platform company and a platform company first. And so really with respect to competition, there is no one out there that can do what we do the way we do it, can automate complex workflows across the enterprise, across silos, across departments. The benefit is really that we can provide the end-to-end functionality across IT, employee, customer throughout the organization. We're the only cross-functional platform that can sit on top of any of the systems of record to enable workflows across those systems of records. Right. So as Bill said earlier, no one has to lose for us to continue to grow and drive. And so our differentiation is that we're really the only software company at our size with one platform, one data model, one architecture, and so we're poised to take advantage of that incremental opportunity as it comes. But you're absolutely right, the TAM is getting larger and larger as we really think about how companies really need to automate the back and middle-office for sure. Zane Chrane : And for what it's worth, I think ServiceNow is the only company that ever estimated a larger TAM than what management claims, so you guys have definitely executed well and congrats on the success. Thank you very much. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Zane. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Lisa Banks, SVP of Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead. Lisa Banks : Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for ServiceNow's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the first quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of January 27, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly including, but not limited to, the timeframes for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decision and the length of our sales cycles particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K that will be filed for fiscal year 2020. For information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income, remaining performance obligations or RPO and current RPO or CRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and our investor presentation and for prior quarters' previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q4 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. Having confronted an unprecedented global environment, we are looking ahead with optimism and are thankful to be so well positioned to serve our customers. Needless to say, we delivered a market-leading 2020. We significantly beat expectations across the board, bringing great momentum into the New Year. I could not be proud of our team's execution. We delivered over 30% organic top line growth, 25% operating margins, and $1.4 billion in free cash flow, just an outstanding performance and a testament to our ServiceNow strong culture. Throughout the year, we led with courage and conviction. We took care of our team, our customers and our communities. And most importantly, we led with ServiceNow's purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. We strive to see the world through our customers' eyes with empathy to address their needs. The workflow revolution is happening and the pandemic is accelerating digital transformation. Every business needs speed, agility and resilience. And every C-suite leader wants to deliver great experiences for their employees and their customers. Businesses are changing the way they operate. They need to deliver fierce customer loyalty and deep employee engagement to win. It's all about people, empathy at mass scale is the business imperative of the 21 century. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovations have all intersected at the perfect moment in time, a paradigm here is happening worldwide. In 2020, for the first time in history, we saw a digital transformation spending accelerate despite GDP declining globally. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing. According to IDC, worldwide digital transformation investments will total more than $7.4 trillion by 2024. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders. ServiceNow is the platform company for digital business. The Now Platform, what I call the platform of platforms offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. Our simple low-code app development enables fast workflows to solve any business challenge, delivering consumer-grade digital experiences. The Now Platform enables easier and faster implementation, delivering unbeatable time to value and fast ROI. That's the beauty of the Now Platform, one platform, one data model and one architecture. We seamlessly integrated all of this and through our system and that system integrate seamlessly with all systems of record that matter most to our customers. We deliver workflows through their preferred collaboration platform as well. We give our customers the freedom of choice to use their preferred tools and the unique ability to build apps at record speed. Hungry and humble is a core ServiceNow value, it\u2019s proven now than ever. We are grateful to be in such a strong position at such a pivotal moment and we are hungry. We are eager to use our strengths to help our customers succeed, help make our community stronger and help create great experiences for people. We are seeing an extraordinary expansion of use cases in our business. Healthcare organizations are using ServiceNow to improve operations and service delivery, which means better outcomes for people. St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital has been on a journey to accelerate progress towards finding cures and saving children. In 2020, COVID-19 created a significant headwind to that mission. With much of the hospital staff required to work-from-home, the need to digitize manual workflows became more important than ever. The hospital leveraged ServiceNow\u2019s low-code App Engine and IntegrationHub to integrate disparate systems and build custom end-to-end workflows, ultimately allowing them to ensure seamless delivery of clinical services. In under four weeks, the ServiceNow solution was implemented at St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital and everybody was moving toward their goal. We\u2019re also proud to be supporting NHS Scotland and their efforts to vaccinate 5.5 million citizens. NHS Scotland is using the Now Platform and our customer workflow to deploy a customized solution designed to meet their specific needs. Deployment took only six weeks, showing the agility of the Now Platform. ServiceNow is enabling a comprehensive solution for the scheduling and reporting of vaccination for Scotland\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. Within 12 hours of roll-out, NHS Scotland booked over 220,000 appointments. So as you can see, it\u2019s not just about business workflows, it\u2019s about real people. Enterprise digital transformation is how every organization in every sector in every geo are adapting, growing, creating new business models and empowering their people to be productive in any environment under any condition. That\u2019s modern, agile, resilient business at work and it\u2019s being powered by the Now Platform. Our unique platform and innovative product suite, our strong brand, high customer satisfaction and compelling value proposition are the differentiating factors and competitive advantages fueling our performance. Our Q4 results are testament. We dreamed big and delivered. We grew billings by more than 40% year-over-year organically. We delivered 89 deals greater than $1 million and now have close to 1,100 customers paying us over $1 million annually. We landed our largest deal ever, surpassing the deal record we set in Q3 with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Deal sizes overall keep getting larger. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 99%. Here are some key customer wins from Q4. We signed a multi-year and multi-product strategic deal with AT&T. They are transforming by focusing on broadband connectivity, 5G and software-based entertainment, while relentlessly focusing on digital, consumer preferences and experiences. We\u2019re delighted to work with AT&T Communications in its transformation. ServiceNow\u2019s AI-powered platform and service operations product lines will provide AT&T accurate and real-time operational visibility into every layer of the network fabric and help deliver the best-in-class customer experience, better experiences for people enabled by ServiceNow. One of the UK\u2019s big four banks is using multiple ServiceNow products, including our purpose-built new financial services operations product to help transform the way it operates and to deliver better customer experiences. The bank has seen a 70% efficiency and improvement of payment processing by integrating the Now Platform into its core banking systems. With ServiceNow, this bank implemented new automated processes in 60 workdays. In their words, employees moved from cut and paste, swivel chair manual processes to efficient, automated workflows. In one case, employees went from managing 10 requests an hour to 1,000 requests in three minutes on the Now Platform, better experiences for people. PayPal recently expanded their relationship with ServiceNow as a key partner for elements of their digital transformation. And we\u2019re proud to have expanded our relationship with Nike, who is using the Now Platform to create better customer and employee experiences. Other Q4 deals across our portfolio represented wins with major customers in key sectors such as Booking.com in travel and hospitality, BP in energy, Santander UK and USAA in financial services and the list goes on and on. I hear so many ServiceNow success stories every day. Companies are onboarding thousands of people in a work-from-home environment, making them feel productive and part of the team from day one. Customers are going live on the Now Platform in days, not months, making a difference for people now, not next month or next year, now. More productive employees, happier customers, more efficient operations, there is not a CEO on the planet, who doesn\u2019t want that, the Now Platform delivers. These examples show how technology is no longer supporting the business, technology is the business. Our IT leadership and workflows gives us a uniquely strong foundation to be the leading platform for digital transformation across the enterprise. In Q4, IT workflow products remained strong. ITSM delivered 17 deals over $1 million. Our AI and machine learning capabilities embedded within our Pro SKU continue to resonate with our customers. ITSM Pro penetration is now over 20%. The AI/ML capabilities of our Pro SKUs are automating processes to allow people to focus on the work that really matters. We saw a three times increase in usage of our virtual agent technology in 2020. And our Element AI acquisition underscores our commitment to being the leader in AI-enabled workflows. Element AI\u2019s deep bench of world-class scientists and practitioners will accelerate our AI innovation on the Now Platform, delivering not only better capabilities for IT, but for employee and customer experiences as well. ITOM was included in 16 of the top 20 deals and had 15 deals over $1 million. Risk had a very strong Q4, booking more wins than all of the prior year combined. Our ability to manage risk is really resonating with customers. ServiceNow is no longer viewed as back-end IT-oriented solution. We\u2019re now seen as a strategic partner that impacts the entire business. Customer workflows is our next $1 billion-plus market opportunity for ServiceNow, and Q4 showed strong momentum. Customer workflows were included in 11 of our top 20 deals, driving such wins as AT&T. 10 of our customer workflow deals were greater than $1 million. In this pandemic, the employee experience is more important than ever, and our employee workflow is seeing strong demand. In Q4, 11 of our top 20 deals included employee workflows. The pandemic is creating the greatest workflow challenge of our time, and ServiceNow is responding with agility, speed and continuous innovation. We began last spring, as you\u2019ll remember, with our emergency response apps helping the state of Washington and many others respond to COVID. We fast followed that release with our Safe Workplace suite of apps that has demonstrated the power of the NOW platform and great employee workflows that we can deliver very quickly, in fact more than 900 organizations now have downloaded the suite already. This week, we just launched the first in a suite of plan vaccine administration applications delivered out of the box functionality for our customers. Our comprehensive approach enables workflow solutions to the complex challenges of vaccine district, administration, and monitoring. As we have done with Safe Workplace, we will be delivering continuous innovation with our vaccine administration management applications. I'm excited to announce that the State of North Carolina, Department of Health and Human Services is already leveraging the ServiceNow platform to power its COVID vaccine management system to help quickly and efficiently vaccinate 10 million North Carolinians. President Biden has declared the distribution of COVID vaccines, a top priority for his administration. This is one of the great workflow challenges of our time, as we are doing right now in Scotland, North Carolina, and many other places, ServiceNow is ready to ensure vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring that it's simple, it's fast and it's effective. It'll be so at the federal, state and local level. In summary, we had an outstanding close to 2020, and we are not slowing down. We are changing the world one workflow at a time and our vision is really resonating. C-Level executives realize that behind every great experience is a great word flow. Our company is hitting on all cylinders. In 2020, we grew our global workforce by 26% hiring 3,000 people in 25 countries with most hired and on-boarded digitally. We are hiring incredible talent, including some of the greatest minds in the AI industry. Our culture is incredibly strong. Our employee engagement is at historic highs. So too is our employee retention. Our brand is strong. C-suite awareness increased in double-digits. Our innovation pipeline is robust. We delivered 70% more features and innovations on the platform in 2020. Our partner ecosystem is expanding : IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and all the great partners in India and many others have joined the workflow revolution with us. Together, we're bringing the innovation speed of a start-up with the scale and reach of a rapidly growing $5 billion plus pure play SaaS company, and our RPO is nearly double that at $9 billion. We're the only born in the cloud software company to have reached this size with our large scale M&A, and we have a clear path to achieve our $10 billion revenue target. We are also deeply committed to making the world to work better for people to helping our customers succeed. We are deeply committed to making the world work better to. Gina will share more about our focus on elevating our global impact. I'm incredibly proud of our just announced $100 million investment in an impact on benefiting underserved communities. And we're deeply committed to being a leader in building a diverse inclusive workforce in which everyone feels that they belong because diverse teams with an indomitable will to win create great companies. ServiceNow is such a company and we are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. That's our dream, and we will pursue it tirelessly with courage, passion, and conviction. Thank you. Over to you, Gina. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Happy New Year, everyone. I want to start-off by echoing Bill's praise for all the employees of ServiceNow. It has been a year of unprecedented challenges, but the team has remained focused on executing and meeting the needs of our customers. I couldn't be more impressed with our resilience, which is a testament to our great culture here at ServiceNow. And thanks to our people that we delivered another fantastic quarter to cap a strong year. We exceeded the high-end of our subscription revenues and subscription billing guidance, which carried through to strong free cash flow generation. Q4 subscription revenues were $1.184 billion representing 32% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a three-point tailwind from FX. Q4 subscriptions billing were very strong at $1.828 billion representing 41% year-over-year growth and a $183 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. Adjusted growth was 38% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.9 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. And current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth. FX was about a three-point tailwind. The traction we are seeing in our top line results, reflect our focus on meeting the needs of our customers and their employees. As Bill noted, the workflow revolution is underway and is centered around the best experiences. And that\u2019s the Now Platform\u2019s super power, the ability to deliver workflows that create those great experiences for people. The NOW Platform is playing a critical role in accelerating digital transformation. We're treating our customers as partners, listening and learning about their challenges so we can help solve them. We aren't selling point products. We\u2019re providing them with comprehensive solutions with measurable results and quick time to value. Better together, that's the power of our portfolio. It's this attention to our customers' needs that\u2019s driving our best-in-class renewal rate of 99%, demonstrating the stickiness of our business as the NOW Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. Our sales teams continued to win bigger deals in Q4, including our largest deal ever, which is three times the size of our previous largest deal. We closed 89 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter, with average deal sizes up 18% year-over-year. In 2020, we added nearly 700 net new customers, ending the year with almost 6,900 enterprises. The number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 40% in fiscal 2020. Customers are realizing the strategic value of combining ServiceNow IT workflows with everything from HR, CSM and our App Engine to deliver greater value across the enterprise. Our ability to land new logos and expand our existing relationships amid a pandemic, further validate the strength of our platform and the value we're delivering to enterprise C-suite. Turning to profitability, Q4 operating margin was 22%, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance. Year-over-year, our Q4 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental R&D investments and marketing spend on pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, up 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and strong collection. For full year 2020, operating margin was 25%, up 300 basis points year-over-year and free cash flow was 32%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we\u2019re seeing in the business. The highly affected industries we outlined early last year, which represented about 20% of our business, continue to see macro headwinds, but remained resilient. Three of our top 20 deals in the quarter were from highly impacted industries, including retail, automotive and energy. We do expect headwinds in some severely impacted industries to persist in 2021. However, retention of existing customers remains very strong in Q4. Overall, we're entering 2021 with strong secular tailwinds created by a surge in demand for digital transformation. Our pipeline continues to look healthy, and our brand continues to resonate with enterprise leaders. ServiceNow is exceptionally well-positioned to seize this opportunity. We have the unique platform and innovative product suite businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Turning to guidance, for transparency and clarity, I\u2019d like to call out a few items. First, as I noted earlier, we saw $80 million in early payments from customers in Q4, which was an approximately 200 basis point tailwind to full year subscription billings growth in 2020. This results in a more significant headwind of about 350 basis points for 2021 billings growth. To be clear, these early payments have no effect on the timing of revenue. We've also previously talked about how early renewals and success with very large customers were impacting billing cycles as they can add additional volatility to timing and duration. This makes billings a less reliable leading indicator of top-line growth. Given this noise and to provide investors with even greater transparency, we're introducing quarterly cRPO guidance. We believe cRPO will provide better visibility and is a more consistent indicator of business performance, normalizing for timing and duration noise. We will continue to provide billings guidance throughout 2021 as a transition period. Second, the need to digitally transform has been accelerated by the current macro environment, creating a very large opportunity for ServiceNow. With the savings we are recognizing from our more efficient operating environment, we're continuing to invest in R&D and quota-bearing resources to drive innovation and pipeline to fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well-positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration. These investments include those we were making in AI, such as the acquisition of Element AI. Similar to previous investments and successful growth initiatives like our Pro SKUs or geographic expansion, we will be disciplined about our spend. Beyond our business investments, we will also be investing in people and communities. We've always been focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging. And as Bill noted, we recently announced our first ever $100 million investment in a racial equity fund to build equitable opportunity for Black communities. This investment is expected to earn a solid return, while facilitating sustainable wealth creation through homeownership, entrepreneurship and neighborhood revitalization. Finally, COVID cases have been spiking in recent weeks, and some regions have reentered lockdown protocols. While we haven't seen any significant impact on our business, we will continue to monitor and be transparent in our disclosures throughout 2021. With that in mind, for Q1 we expect subscription revenues between $1.275 billion and $1.28 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including a four-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.31 billion and $1.315 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early payments from customers in 2020, our Q1 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of four points. We expect cRPO growth of 32% year-over-year, including a five-point FX tailwind. We expect an operating margin of 25% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect subscription revenues between $5.48 billion and $5.5 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a three-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $6.205 billion and $6.225 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our 2021 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. This growth reflects an acceleration in net new ACV in 2021, and it also includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of two points. We expect subscription gross margin of 85%, reflecting some federal and public sector customers moving to our newly launched Azure offering as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. We expect an operating margin of 23.5%, representing 150 basis points expansion off of our pre-COVID 2020 run rate. I would note that this is also an incremental 50 basis points more than the 100 basis points of expansion we target each year. Finally, we expect free cash flow margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year. In summary, in 2020, we delivered a combination of both strong top line growth and profitability, an incredible accomplishment in a COVID environment. Our outstanding results continued to demonstrate our strong product portfolio, our focus on building deep customer relationships and our commitment to enabling their digital transformation. We\u2019re delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. We are the platform company for digital business. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team's performance and our unrelenting execution in a turbulent year. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. We're well on our way to becoming a $10 billion revenue company on the strength of incredible organic innovation. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling, your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. So in relation to the margin outlook, understand the investment opportunity that you have, but also curious what you've factored in, in terms of any increased T&E and maybe perhaps even there I say the return to a little bit of business travel throughout the year. And can you help us understand kind of what assumptions underlie the margin outlook on that front? Gina Mastantuono : Sure, Sterling. Thanks for the question. We talked about really continuing to focus on driving a balance of growth and profitability, and I've been pretty transparent and open about those margins. We are currently expecting that a more normalized T&E will come back towards the back-half of 2021. And so the expectations on the front-half will be similar to what we've been seeing, but that we would expect some more normalized T&E to start again in the back-half. Sterling Auty : Great. And then one just follow-up. In terms of the digital transformations in the applications that you're tying into, I'd be kind of curious beyond HR and CSM, what are perhaps some of the other applications that you think that customers are going to more rely on your platform as hopefully the economy picks up on the back of vaccinations? Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much, Sterling. This is Bill. What you're seeing out there is each industry has its own nuances. For example, in financial services, I talked about security. Obviously, the future of work is a big movement to work from anywhere and certainly enable that modern work environment and do that in a way where people can be onboarded without actually even meeting them, train them appropriately and do the ongoing management of people where they can truly execute their mission and they know all the information and they have all the data to do their job. So this is happening in every industry and it's happened in every geo and each persona has its own unique needs. What we think is unique about ServiceNow is that this platform, think of it as the workflow automation platform, comprehends all the opportunities with App Engine to customize things very rapidly like vaccine management, for example. It also offers the IntegrationHub. And what the IntegrationHub enables is all the things from RPA, process mining, API integration, process analytics, native mobile, contextual interfaces, and all the other things that CIOs and leaders of businesses are counting on to create end-to-end continuity in the business. And that's what makes us so unique. So having that platform advantage and our well-known position in IT is equally as relevant with the employee experience, because now you have one portal with a consumer-grade UX, all the complexity is hidden, all the onboarding caring for the employee is done and they are right off and running with their mission. In some cases, I had one very high-level executive tell me, I haven't met the 5,000 people I hired this year because of the Now Platform. And then on customer service management, in every industry, and I gave the AT&T example as one, you're seeing this frictionless business environment really take off. So how do we deal with the end consumer and do so directly in a way that enables our services to be consumed. So you're seeing this ease of use around ServiceNow, you're seeing the virtual agent guide people through subscription processes, and you're seeing all of our deep machine learning and AI help the customer navigate their sign-on processes and so forth. And the workflow then becomes the exception because humans shouldn't have to get involved in these processes unless the computer didn't get the job done and that gives us such an advantage because we're seeing situations where we can literally consolidate hundreds of systems that our Now Platform take out huge costs, give the customer a great experience and obviously not put so much pressure on human capital because people are only engaged when they're absolutely necessary in the customer satisfaction process. So you're seeing a mass consolidation of all the old stuff to the Now Platform. You're seeing IT employee, customer and all of the App Engine and IntegrationHub opportunities really come together on one common platform, one data model and one architecture. So it's now a solutions company. It's now selling a suite and the broad spectrum of offerings gives us reach to the whole C-level executive team, not just one persona on the executive team. Sterling Auty : Thanks, Bill. Bill McDermott : My pleasure, Sterling. Operator : For our next question, we have Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Keith, your line is open. Keith Bachman : Yes, thank you very much. I'll ask my questions - my two questions concurrently if I could. One, in the comments you mentioned that you thought you would see an acceleration of net new ACV, which \u2013 in 2021, which I thought was very interesting. I was wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more on, a, the visibility into that; and b, anything that's bubbling up in terms of there seems to be a greater emphasis to drive that net new ACV what area? The follow-on question I want to direct to you, Bill, if I could. Last year, you're pretty clear that acquisitions was not part of your strategy and maybe some tuck-ins here and there. 2021 is a new year, lots of changes. The digital landscape is a greater priority. Is there any change in your thoughts as you're considering how ServiceNow could effectively build that long-term model as it relates to M&A? That's it for me and many thanks. Bill McDermott : Yes. Well, thank you very much, Keith. Maybe I'll start off and then give Gina a chance to build as she wishes on the net new ACV inquiry. First of all, I'll just say that net new ACV on a year-over-year basis will increase and the pipelines that we have in the company and we manage the company on what we call a CEO dashboard in real-time give us much greater coverage than we had last year. So we know that the facts substantiate the net new ACV increase. One of the interesting things that is fascinating is actually our executive briefings have increased 70% on a year-over-year basis. So if you think about our ability to get to the C-suite and increase the contact in this kind of virtual environment, it's actually gone way up. So a lot of people, I guess, need a good meeting and they want to figure out how they're going to digitally transform and the Now Platform has just dynamite tailwind key. Now, in terms of the whole digital landscape, IDC, I think, the $7.4 trillion is very interesting statistic. This is factual. If you just look at the way companies are prioritizing their investments, the one thing that's not going to get deep prioritized is digital transformation and things that enable digital business, because it's really the only way to either get your stuff competitive or to increase your competitive advantage and your peer group, and every CEO completely understand that. And within that context, I think the uniqueness of ServiceNow to have so much, so much momentum, not just in exciting new areas like the future of work with our employee experience or customer service management, which is really a frictionless economy now more and more coming ServiceNow's way, but even in our core with IT. If you look at our ITSM core business, it's outgrown our internal expectations by a lot. And you've seen with the Pro SKU where we add on the machine learning and the AI capabilities on a platform approach that two is growing fast and our engineering team is incredible here. I mean the level of innovation they're pushing out with 70% increase 2020 over 2019 and we have major releases coming this year commensurate with what we did last year. So I wanted to give you a lot of confidence that the net new ACV is going up, the customers are buying and the pipeline is super strong. And here is one thing that I found fascinating. There was a study done by Deloitte. And with all this digital transformation, a lot of executives are looking back and saying, hey, why didn't I get a better return on all I put into digital? And what they found is that about three quarters of the digital transformation projects, didn't give the yielded return on investment that they had hoped for and the number one root cause was integration. So as you think about the Now Platform integrating with 550 systems of record out of the box and all the collaboration tools, no matter which one the customer likes and have that completely synchronized into the Now Platform out of the box and you're up and running in days. It's kind of an attractive value proposition to our customers and even non-customers that want to jump onboard. Gina Mastantuono : I wouldn't add anything more on that. I think that that was a great answer, Bill, on the acceleration of net new ACV. On the M&A conversation, I think, Bill, I know you have a perspective. Bill McDermott : Yes. I mean, look here's the situation, Keith. We are not against M&A. So far we have done technology tuck-ins or we've done, what I would call, human capital tuck-ins such as we've done with AI. We've gotten tremendous people into the organization to put all the value into the Now Platform and to generate net new revenue growth in the SKUs such as what we did with IT, we'll do with employee, we'll do with customer and obviously we'll do with the low code, no code innovation that we can give to the creator, which is literally a business analyst or anyone that wants to write a low code application in an enterprise. So the way we look at large scale or larger scale M&A, we wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't look at every opportunity to satisfy our customers and our shareholders, but it's important just to register with you that our projection on the 10 billion is clearly in hand with our organic innovation and the momentum we have in the marketplace with our customers, and also the non-customers that want to join the team. So, there's nothing on the table right now for a larger deal, but it's not like we don't have our eyes wide open at the various opportunities. And if they ever presented themselves, you would know that we thought through it rigorously and it was part of our strategic imperative to really do the best we can for our shareholders and our customers. But right now that is not on the table and it's not something that's actionable at this time. Keith Bachman : Thank you guys very much. Operator : For our next question we have Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo, your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hi. Thank you and congrats from me as well. I have two quick questions. One number question I'll start with that before I forget. Gina, like I got a couple of questions in the 200 basis points headwind you got in 2020, like, can you just walk us through the math how that becomes like 350 basis point in 2021? They had a good few guys that just kind of struggle with that one. And then let's start with the one for Bill. Bill, ITSM Pro should give you like we see the early momentum there. You talked about the 20% penetration. Just how does it help you on the on the expansion and the renewal and the conversations you get with clients has a really good tool to engage the client base? Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Sure. So I'll take the first one. So yes, in Q4, we talked about 80 million of billings that were accelerated in Q4 out of Q1 of 2020. And so basically if you take that 80 out of Q4 and put it back into 2020 \u2013 and put it back into 2021 that's where you see that double impact, right. And so, you might take it out of 2020 and add it back into 2021. And so it's about a 200 basis point tailwind to 2020, but then about 350 basis headwind in 2021. So we try to do all the math for you, so that's pretty clear. And just to be clear that these were early customer payments. And we feel like it's one time in nature, and it was really results of our customers having excess cash driven by the OpEx savings that we said they were seeing in 2020. And so, I hope that that clarifies you, Raimo. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. That really helps. Thank you. Appreciate that. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks. Bill McDermott : Great. And then Raimo, I\u2019ll just give you a view for our ITSM Pro because that was your question. First of all, it\u2019s growing in steep double-digits, very important. And while we\u2019ve penetrated 20%, that means we still have 80% to go. So it's a really, really one of the growth opportunity from a shareholder value creation perspective. But what you\u2019re looking at is the remote IT services requests growing exponentially, and many of the IT organizations out there are looking for ways to deflect lower-tier cases. So by leveraging chatbots and streamlining processes part of the AI ML capabilities are embedded with our Pro SKU. So that\u2019s one aspect of it. And when you start to think about all the innovation that we\u2019ve built in to this platform and the latest product releases, again the value is so much greater because of the organic innovation the team has put into it. But customers are loving, gee, wow, I can transform IT, which then has an impact on the employee experience and the whole future of work. And incidentally, there isn\u2019t a customer out there now that\u2019s not asking us to revolutionize their call center operations or enable people to work from a virtual environment better and obviously in this frictionless economy how can I do things with a no-touch or possibly the lowest touch possible, how can I eliminate the middleman in my margin pursuit as companies trying to grow in different industries. All of that requires the IT backbone. So what you\u2019re seeing is a multiplying effect of one story compounding into another and really stretching the perimeter of what we\u2019re doing for executives across the enterprise. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing deal sizes get larger and larger. You are seeing us be in a very strong position in terms of the product, the value that it delivers, and the processes that we\u2019ve built for not only pre-sale sale value creation but also post-sale value creation. So ML, AI and the leadership that we\u2019ve built into this platform is really unique. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect, very clear. Congrats again. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Raimo. Operator : For our next question, we have Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Kash, your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Bill and Gina and the rest of the team. My question for you, Bill, is the company has done a phenomenal job increasing its wallet share with really large companies through ITSM Pro, CSM workflow, HR, et cetera. The question for you is, as you approach the $10 billion journey and you look at other markets and software, you tend to have companies that\u2019s in database market or ERP, have a customer base that\u2019s closer to 100,000, 200,000, maybe even 400,000, 500,000. So as you look at the \u2013 how do we put it, the scaling up of ServiceNow into a company that can serve not just 8,000, 9,000 customers, but more like 100,000, 200,000 customers, what does that journey look like? And what are your plans to make this excellent piece of technology that\u2019s known to less than 10,000, to be actually known and adopted by 100,000, maybe 200,000 customers? Thank you so much. That\u2019s my only question. Bill McDermott : It\u2019s my pleasure, Kash. Thank you very much for your kind remarks. As you think about our company, what\u2019s the beauty of us right now is we execute with the speed of a start-up, but we have the scale of a global company. So you\u2019re seeing us now expand in Europe quite dramatically. We\u2019re hiring amazing, amazing talent. You\u2019re seeing us make moves into the Middle East. You\u2019re seeing the expansion in Latin America. We\u2019re really like starting to kick it into high gear in Asia with an expansion in South Korea. We have lots of plans and we have a well known brand, of course, in Australia, in other more mature markets. In the United States, I feel like we\u2019re just getting started based upon the amazing receptivity to this Now Platform. And I think that a lot of that came from our emergency response to COVID and now the vaccine management. And you look at markets and industries like financial services, like telecommunications, like our government business and so many more. So, I would say, we\u2019re just getting started in terms of the real extents in for scale. The brand has now become a very well-known brand. The ecosystem tailwind has really kicked in, in the last 12 months. And once you get calls from amazing big brands and they say I have to team up with you, my customers are demanding that I team up with you and integrate beautifully in the Now Platform. My customers are telling me. That\u2019s a large telco company. In fact, it\u2019s not the one that I mentioned as the example, and they said, we got to do more with you. So you\u2019re seeing now a world where the Fortune 2000 gives us an extreme opportunity for growth beyond $10 billion. But our brand and industry and geography and persona, and same account revenue growth and net new logos, which Gina and I also have an operating plan that increases pretty large this year-over-year in addition to the NNACV, net new ACV. So Kash, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 look at our four businesses that we already are in, look at every one of them as multibillion opportunities and then don\u2019t forget the platform because I think more and more as the citizen developer concept takes off the ServiceNow. It will find this in locations that go way beyond the Fortune 2000. And keep in mind, a lot of those large companies that you mentioned, they might have about 1,000 companies and they say they have a couple of hundred thousand because of all the subsidiaries and so on. So we\u2019re talking about real companies with real names. And I think the subsidiaries of those and all peers, the world will really take off as well. We\u2019re in the early days here. Kash Rangan : Very exciting. Thank you so much. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : For our next question, we have Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter, your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thank you. Bill, a question for you just broadly. I think if we were sitting here \u2013 when we were sitting here three or four years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have imagined the success that the employee product and the customer service product have had. And I\u2019m wondering how you think about, over the next several years, your growth from more prescribed SaaS applications versus the past that I feel like you\u2019ve talked about more on this call. And what would you point to in terms of some of the emerging SaaS products that might be today where HR and customer service were three or four years ago? Thanks. Bill McDermott : Yes, sure, absolutely. Well, first of all, I would feature, Walter, the platform itself. And I believe strongly that ServiceNow has now pivoted to be that platform company for digital transformation. And that is a big difference from being, \u201cwhat some used to say was the ERP of IT\u201d. So think about this as a platform company. Think about the core business and the continuous innovation that we\u2019re doing in the core to stretch the core into new frontiers. We have a whole organization that is focused on the next big thing. So all the businesses that you would understand well, whether we invented it or someone else did, they all want to cooperate with the Now Platform, because the IntegrationHub enables them to get in. And once they get in, then they can build their imagination and their dreams with ServiceNow. So, I think, there\u2019s a big business model in that that we have only scratched the surface on. If you think about employee experience, I think the companies that I talked to including ours, we run someone else\u2019s system of record. But if you talk to 13,000 people in ServiceNow, nobody could possibly pick the system of record out of a lineup because all they look at is this gorgeous consumer-grade UI that\u2019s driven by the ServiceNow portal, where all the services that they need based on their job profile are right there for them, I mean how big is that market. And the same thing with customer service management. We\u2019re learning fast in this new world that we\u2019ve gone way beyond SFA and up-sells and cross-sells and conditioning that around a marketing campaign. We\u2019re into business model innovation, where great companies like Disney or AT&T are rethinking their business model entirely and they\u2019re capitalizing on the streaming rage, and they\u2019re coming up with subscription business models that reinvent the customer experience and give them net new businesses. ServiceNow is in that to win. And I think that TAM is absolutely unbelievable. The other TAM that\u2019s pretty interesting that nobody spends much time talking about, but it\u2019s one of the reasons I see ServiceNow's future is so bright. If you just take paper-based processes that are clocking up all of these companies and you digitize them to the Now Platform, there is a well-known bank out there that says the U.S. market alone is a $280 billion market, which maybe globally that\u2019s $400 billion market. And then I think this platform business, I really see an amazing, amazing future for the platform business. Just think about this. If you\u2019re the state of North Carolina and you\u2019re a ServiceNow customer and you\u2019ve got a vaccine management challenge, like literally in days they can build a custom application tailored to 10 million citizens to get them the vaccine in their arm to protect them from this terrible virus. Again, that is just built on to the Now Platform using the App Engine, the IntegrationHub and all the innovation that our great engineers have built. So, we\u2019re at the early days and there are some things that we have planned for that will be forthcoming in the months and year ahead. But right now, I just want to keep you focused on what we\u2019re doing, because literally we\u2019ve only scratched the surfaces of these businesses. Walter Pritchard : Thanks, Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Walter. Operator : Next, we have Tom Roderick from Stifel. Tom, your line is open. Tom Roderick : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and I\u2019ll echo the sentiments on congratulations on a great finish to a challenging but phenomenal year. Bill, I wanted to ask you just a question on the App Engine. Just looking at this percentage of ACV mix surged to 15%, you\u2019re seeing certainly larger and larger customers and more customers lean in on the App Engine vision. I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about that. In particular, if you could talk about what the App Engine vision has meant for your relationship with the channel partners, Accenture, Deloitte and others? Just broadly speaking, it would be fantastic to hear about how you look at that today and how that\u2019s changing, how big customers and partners like your SIs are leaning in here? Bill McDermott : Yes, fantastic. So let\u2019s start with the whole idea of the partners. There isn\u2019t a partner that\u2019s a global partner right now that does not have a business plan that\u2019s $1 billion or more with ServiceNow. And many of them are in the multiple billions, and they\u2019re building their business model. Some of them tell me, they look at the Now Platform as the cross-platform integration engine of their business model with the various other companies, whether it\u2019s system of record software company or collaborative software company that they also have partnerships with. But they\u2019re looking at us as the center of that digital transformation effort. That is a very, very big tailwind. Many of the net new innovative applications that they will bring to their customers, they\u2019re building on the Now Platform because the low-code, no-code simplicity of the platform can enable them to do things at record speeds, and I think that is a big, big unlock for them. So platform is really big. I also think the ML and the AI movement that we\u2019re on, Element AI was kind of the finishing touch of four M&A moves that we made, which was really about acquiring not just patents and thought leadership, but real enablement of the Now Platform, so we can truly unleash humanity in ways that heretofore were not possible. And the computer and the human now can do things in terms of decision-making, removing soul-crushing work that nobody really wants to do, issuing workflow orders only when it\u2019s necessary because the virtual agent can solve 90% of the problems and most engagement with customers. And this is now like a whole new universe because many of those partners looked at us an IT. And now the employee experience, for example, is one of Deloitte's most desired personas and they're actually extraordinarily good at the employee experience and they give us reach globally and there are others on customer service management now that is saying what we\u2019re doing especially with digitizing business processes, ease of use on subscription models, like Disney+. We are so honored to see Disney+ say, that\u2019s our digital bridge to the future. We have great core businesses, but this is a digital bridge to the future. And ServiceNow is right in the mix of all of that. So look, it\u2019s a once in a generation opportunity, and I\u2019m really, really happy. And I also look at the technology partners that we have now that have just adopted us as the standard for IT and so many other things. We made the announcement on IBM where they basically looked at their ITSM on-premise business and said we got to go to the cloud. We\u2019d rather go to the cloud with you that\u2019s where the innovation is and we've won very good partnerships like we're doing with Microsoft, connecting with O365 teams dynamics and bringing a whole new understanding of what\u2019s possible with the Now Platform working interdependently with Microsoft. So, all that and more is all in the mix from our growth plan. Tom Roderick : That\u2019s great color, Bill. Congratulations. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much. Operator : Next question, we have Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Gregg, your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz : All right. Thanks very much, and congratulations as well on a very strong end to the year. I\u2019ll just ask one question in the interest of time. Bill, you recently hired a leader for your customer workflows business, and you\u2019ve obviously done well here. But can you walk through what you see as incremental solutions or monetization opportunities in this area? Bill McDermott : Yes, absolutely. Again, we\u2019re hiring best-in-class talent. We obviously have extremely bold ambitions to what we think we can do in the customer service management arena. Also, John Ball, who is the gentleman that we hired as you know, he ran the Einstein initiative over another software company in the area. And we feel that he has domain expertise. And when he saw what we were doing in customer service management, he said, this is where I want to work. He said, this is the biggest thing that I've seen. He said I can't get over this NOW Platform, its simplicity, how quickly I can innovate on it. I'll give you an example. He was front and center on the vaccine management innovation. Literally, that whole process took us three weeks where vaccine management as a concept and an application was developed in three weeks and launched to the global marketplace. And it's in Scotland, it's in UK, it's in many states now in the United States. And in the not too distant future, hopefully it\u2019s helping many of the federal agencies help the Biden administration save lives here in America and obviously in other parts of the world too. So it's the speed at which you can innovate on this platform. It's the pristine nature of this platform that you don't have to work with multiple different platforms from different M&A moves or different levels of complexity that others have built up over time. Here, it's just like there it is innovate on, it. What's the idea, let's code it and let's get it out to the market. We did emergency response apps, if you remember, over a weekend and we launched them globally in a week. I mean it\u2019s just unheard of. And that's what's really exciting that our engineers are spending all of their time coding new innovations as opposed to integrating past applications. Gregg Moskowitz : It's great. Thanks Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Gregg. Operator : We have time for one more question, and it's from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Fred, your line is open. Fred Havemeyer : Thank you very much for taking my question. I thought I'd actually go on a bit of a different direction here. And I'd like to ask as someone who actually led No-Code projects for Fortune 500 companies during the pandemic, I'd love to dig into your Low-Code vision a little bit more. How do you see ServiceNow positioned within the Low- and No-Code markets, to be able to enable line of business users to develop workflow automation and really deliver on that promise of democratizing development? Bill McDermott : Yes, that's the whole point. That\u2019s what we're talking about here. I'll give you an example. I had one CEO said to me, hey, I want to get a good score on Glassdoor. And he said there doesn't seem to be an application on the market for it. I said yes why don't you get a business analyst and we'll design a workflow around that, and then you can launch it out into your company in record speed like a couple of days. So, what's unique here in the case of vaccine management as an example, you took the platform and you customized something in a few days basically to vaccinate 5.5 million people. But in the case of something where you just need to flow chart a workflow and rethink a process to, for example, roll out a rewards program or a recognition program that could be done by a business analyst. So we're not inhibited by prepackaged software or doing things that are quite complex in development in the case of the platform because all you need is an idea. And if you have an idea, a business analyst can code on this platform. If you have an idea that's a little bit more complex, you can have a Low-Code situation where somebody with a little bit of computer intelligence skills can navigate this platform. So this is kind of the secret sauce. I tell you, when I think about what it can be because of the architecture and the simplicity of the platform itself, our imaginations just keep getting more and more fulfilled with dreams and excitement. And I\u2019m just so excited by our engineering teams. And Gina and I have made sure that we fund them now appropriately and most of the investments around here go to the great engineers and the people that serve our customers. There's zero bureaucracy in this company, just like there's zero bureaucracy in the platform. Fred Havemeyer : Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

During today's call, we will review our first quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the second quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance is based on information as of April 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distances and other mitigation requirements. The continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the Risk factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020 for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income, remaining performance obligations or RPO and current RPO or cRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and our investor presentation and for prior quarters previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill. William McDermott : Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to all of you. Welcome to our Q1 earnings call. I hope everyone remains healthy and safe, and you and your loved ones are benefiting from broader vaccine availability. ServiceNow remains grateful to be in such a strong position to help support our families, communities and customers. We started 2021 with another outstanding quarter, delivering a perfect balance of growth and profitability. Our team is executing, maintaining a swift pace towards our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. In Q1, we grew subscription revenue 30% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance. We delivered strong profitability with operating margin over 27%, and we increased free cash flow margin 7 points year-over-year to 46%. Our significant Q1 beat across the Board represents the passion our culture has for innovating and our relentless focus on the customer. We are ideally positioned to deliver what our customers need. In the past year, the transformation of work has accelerated the adoption of digital products, services and experiences. As a result, digital investments are an all-time high and will total more than $7.8 trillion by 2024 according to IDC. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for digital transformation across the enterprise. We have expanded the boundaries from IT to employee, customer and now creator workflows for citizen developers. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders, and so are we. Our culture was born for this moment. Our team of 14,000 colleagues are exponential thinkers. This is how we continuously bring innovation to everything we do. In just the past 18 months, we have more than doubled the features and functionality of our platform for our customers. We're at the epicenter of the workflow revolution. Our purpose has never been more relevant. We are making the world of work, work better for people. We are helping our customers drink bit and to build their digital bridge to the future. Xerox, for example, is working with ServiceNow to transform the services industry, leveraging our field service management, their technicians will use machine learning to proactively solve customer problems. They're using virtual and augmented reality tools to resolve their customers' issues via desktop, mobile and smart glass devices. In this bold mill world is as if their agents are there in person. Digital transformation is about creating great employee and customer experiences. In an increasingly distributed hybrid workforce, companies need to create frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. This requires seamless cross enterprise workflows, linking systems, silos, departments and processes, only the Now platform can do this with native integrations. The platform of platforms, the power of one, one data model, one architecture, one enterprise solution to workflow every business challenge. This is what ServiceNow delivers. We are the only ones doing what we do, the way we do it. Strong demand for ServiceNow is evident in our results, high growth, organically driven at mass scale, while aggressively investing in future growth and delivering significant profitability. An amazing business model and a true testament to the power of the Now platform. Our teams keep innovating. We're proud that Qu\u00e9bec, our latest platform release delivered 1,700 new customer capabilities, breakthrough innovations like predictive AI operations, AI search and virtual agents that enhance every experience, to name a few. ServiceNow is helping customers move to the cloud and invent new business models. The past year has demonstrated that giving people the right productivity tools is critical to success, especially in distributed work environments. It's why organizations like Adobe, Deutsche Telekom, Logitech, city of Los Angeles and Discover are using the Now platform. Discover, in fact, is fully utilizing the Now platform's ease of upgrade, participating in the early adopter program for our Qu\u00e9bec release. Now Discover is able to focus on timely availability, and adoption of new functionality, the Now platform is the gold standard for time to value. By the end of 2021, Forrester Research predicts that 75% of development shops will use low-code platforms. With Qu\u00e9bec, we are delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of the engineering organization and into the hands of citizen developers. Employees without software expertise who need to quickly create workflow applications. We're seeing strong response. The National Cancer Institute at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is a great example. NCI has established a digital service center around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. In just 10 days, NCI leverage ServiceNow to build a new application for an online portal to collect and track specimens from COVID-19 patients. ServiceNow's low-code app is helping NCI staff support the global research community in understanding how genetic factors contribute to the severity of COVID-19 cases. We also introduced process and workforce optimization capabilities in our new enterprise SKUs. This brings even more intelligence to our customers, allowing them to be more agile. We're putting new AI capabilities in the hands of our customers, so they can enhance productivity while spending more time on human creativity. With our recent acquisition of Intellibot, ServiceNow will have an unmatched intelligent workflow automation solution with RPA, AI, machine learning and process mining native to the Now platform. You'll hear more about this from our Chief Product and Engineering Officer, CJ Desai, at our upcoming Investor Day. Please be there. Now let's look more closely at Q1 performance highlights across our portfolio. Our better together solutions continue to drive more multi-product deals. Our core IT workflows remain strong. ITSM was in 12 of our top 20 deals. Our AI and ML capabilities embedded with our pro SKU, continue to resonate with customers. ITOM had a strong quarter and was in 13 of the top 20 deals. EMEA was especially strong. We're hitting a new Gear with CEO engagement. We're seeing more demand across industries, including financial services as EU banking regulations require companies to have full visibility into their assets while also managing risk. HSBC, for example, chose ServiceNow in a multiyear partnership as their workflow partner of choice to help them digitize at scale. Supporting HSBC's employees, ServiceNow will deliver the technologies needed to simplify their architectural landscape. This creates efficiencies, better controls and compliance. Australia and New Zealand Banking group also chose the ServiceNow platform to consolidate, simplify its IT systems and streamline operations to improve the employee experience. The Now platform gives them the advantage of a fully integrated view of technology and risk. We continue to see strength in our customer workflows. Our investment in the telco vertical are gaining traction daily and it's materializing in wins across the globe. Lumen Technologies, a leading telecommunications company is transforming its customer care, and assurance function with ServiceNow customer workflows. They will use the Now platform to deliver best-in-class customer experiences across their networking, cloud and security solutions. Telia, a leading multinational telecommunications company, selected ServiceNow to transform service operations, connecting network operations, employees and customers around the world. Creating workflows, our platform business was in 19 of our top 20 deals. Three of our top 10 app engine wins came from APJ where we are seeing increased awareness of ServiceNow and is continuing to drive demand. A large global manufacturing company in Japan is planning to use our app engine to automate manual processes take out cost and risk associated with migrating on-premise applications to the cloud. This will be a movement in Japan. In the US, the Now platform is at the heart of the city of Los Angeles' digital transformation, helping to provide reliable access to essential services for its four million citizens. The city is expanding its use of digital technology to provide immediate access services, which enables citizens to get the assistance they deserve. Employee workflows were included in eight of our top 20 deals. Zalando is a leading online platform for fashion and lifestyle, connecting customers, brands and partners. As part of their HR transformation, they will implement a central employee services portal using ServiceNow's employee workflows. Zalando sees this as a critical component in supporting their growth, and improving their employee experiences. Employee and workplace safety are top of mind for our customers. We are the only company with a complete suite of applications to meet these critical needs. Since the start of the pandemic, ServiceNow has been at the forefront of solving unprecedented challenges. We saw the meet early and acted quickly. First, our emergency response apps, then our safe workplace apps and now with vaccine administration management, we leverage the speed and agility of the Now platform and the incredible talent of our product team to innovate fast, deliver market-leading solutions to support our customers and help keep them safe. You see, organization trap in the last mile of vaccine management as they lack the processes and infrastructure needed to vaccinate people quickly. This is the workflow challenge of our time. To address these challenges, organizations are using the Now platform as their vaccine management manage center. Our workflows are connected organization's existing technology infrastructure to help orchestrate the critical elements of the vaccine management process, including distributing administering and monitoring vaccines. The Minnesota children's hospital implemented our vaccine administration management in five days, so they can stay focused on their number one priority, caring for children. The hospital is using ServiceNow virtual assistant to answer questions and scheduled patient vaccinations. They are leveraging inventory tracking and scheduling to ensure appointments, staffing levels and vaccines are all in sync. Germany's largest state, North Ryan Westfalia, is using ServiceNow to support vaccinations for millions of people. Within two hours of the portal going live, 120,000 people have registered and received an appointment. ServiceNow ended Q1 working with over 100 organizations and governments globally to help vaccinate people at scale. We are supporting the delivery and management of millions of vaccines globally. We will continue to do more. The workflow revolution is all about helping people. We are humbled to be helping so many people around the world manage this workflow challenge. In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong momentum. I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. From the beginning of this pandemic, we have focused on taking care of our people and taking care of our customers. That's why we're so grateful to be named to the Fortune 100 Best places to work list for the first time.

We are well on our way to $10 billion and beyond, and we are striving with all we have to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q1 was a great start to the year. On the heels of a tremendous Q4, the team continued to execute well and delivered another strong quarter of outperformance. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenue, subscription billings and cRPO guidance and those top line beats carried through to a very robust operating margin and strong free cash flow. Q1 subscription revenues were $1.293 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 4-point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.8 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth, putting us well on our way towards our $10 billion revenue target. Current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion representing 33% year-over-year growth and 100 basis points beat versus our guidance. Notably, we delivered that beat with 100 basis points less of an FX tailwind. Due to the weaker euro, currency contributed four points instead of our original outlook for a 5-point tailwind. Q1 subscription billings were $1.365 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth and a $3 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 4-point tailwind year-over-year. As Bill mentioned, we saw particular strength in EMEA as investments made in 2020 are gaining traction. In Q1, the region closed one of its largest deals ever, helping to drive very strong year-over-year net new ACV growth. We're also seeing improving trends in APJ, where we were in two of the top three platform deals in the quarter. We continue to see the secular tailwinds driven by the intersection of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovation. Every C-suite leader wants to create great experiences for their employees and their customers, and ServiceNow is delivering. The Now platform offers the speed flexibility and innovation companies needs. The sustained strength of our top line growth is the result of consistent execution from across the organization as we address these opportunities. From our engineers who continue to drive leading edge innovation to the sales and customer success teams who partner with our customers to ensure we're delivering value and everyone else in between that helped to deliver great experiences. It's been a tremendous team effort. Our renewal rate remains strong at 97% as the Now platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We closed 37 deals greater than one million ACV in the quarter, including seven net new customers. Our focus on selling comprehensive solutions instead of point products continue to drive more multi-product fields as 17 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. We now have 1,146 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 23% year-over-year, and the number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 50% year-over-year. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 27%, up 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong top line outperformance and the timing of some spend that will shift into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 46%, up 700 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong collections and lower T&E. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in our business. The industry is highly affected by COVID that we outlined earlier last year, which represent about 20% of our business, remains resilient in Q1. We closed several 7-figure deals in these verticals, and renewal rates were ahead of the company average. However, we did continue to see some headwinds in severely impacted industries such as airlines. Regardless of the industry, in an increasingly distributed and hybrid workforce, companies need to create consistent and frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing as companies must reinvest themselves for the new economy. ServiceNow is the strategic authority in digital transformation, and we're committed to helping our customers succeed in that journey. These strong secular tailwinds paired with the strength and agility of the Now platform positions us well for 2021 and beyond. Pipeline generation has remained robust globally, even ahead of our Knowledge 2021 event, which is a big driver, particularly for the Americas. It is helping to drive the net new ACV acceleration in our business this year. Enterprises around the world are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model and its ability to deliver great scalable experiences with speed and efficiency. Now let's turn to guidance. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.29 billion and $1.295 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth, including a 300 basis point FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including a 250 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.25 billion and $1.255 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 300 basis points. We expect an operating margin of 21.5%, which includes $15 million of sales and marketing spend that shifted out of Q1 and into Q2, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. For the full year 2021, we're raising our top line growth guidance on a constant currency basis. We are increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription revenue expectations by $32 million based on the strong trends we saw in Q1. However, a weaker euro resulted in a $59 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription revenues between $5.455 billion and $5.47 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth. This includes a 200 basis point FX tailwind. Similarly, we're increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription billings expectation by $50 million on a constant currency basis. However, the weaker euro resulted in a $68 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription billings between $6.19 billion and $6.205 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. This includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 150 basis points. In terms of quarterly seasonality, we're continuing to see a shift of Q2 and Q3 subscription billings into Q4. We now expect about 21% of our total subscription billings to be in Q3 and 37% to be in Q4. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 85% and operating margin of 23.5%. Finally, we expect recapture margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year. You'll hear more about our strategy and long-term opportunity at our upcoming Investor Day on May 10, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. In addition to making work, work better for people, we're also committed to making the world work better as well. This week, we unveiled our first ever global impact report. At our Investor Day, I'm excited to be able to share ServiceNow's global impact strategy with you. In conclusion, ServiceNow is leading this once in a generation opportunity to make work, work better for people. We are focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. We have the platform businesses need and where the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Customers are using the Now platform to create new workflows for new value chains, to improve experiences across silo systems and functions to reduce friction in people's daily lives, and it's showing in our financial results. I'm very excited about the future in front of us. Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for helping to make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 Best places to work. ServiceNow's greatest strength is its people, and you all continue to make us ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this team. And with that, I'll open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys, for taking the question and nice to see the really strong start to the year. I think there's a question for Bill. I think one of the most notable kind of KPIs that we saw is that pickup in the platform business going to 20% of the new ACV, up from 15% just last quarter. That seems to be a pretty big pickup. Can you talk to us - give us a little bit of color in terms of what's enabling those bigger, more strategic platform sales? Was there any processes you put into place with the sales force? Or is it the new partnerships? Or give us some kind of idea of kind of how that picked up so -- is so much in the results this quarter? William McDermott : Yes, absolutely. I'd be happy to, Keith. Thank you for the question. I think the answer is we've done all of those things. With Qu\u00e9bec, we're delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of just the engineering organization and really into the hands of the citizen developers. So as you know, with digital transformation is a whole move to modernized apps, and this is really tying engineering and business together, and we're seeing a greater market awareness for ServiceNow's digital transformation enablement to automate manual processes within organizations. And we have a focus in this company on being the platform of all platforms, which means, we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So lots of folks integrate into the Now platform. And our low-code, no-code app development to create new workflows that deliver great experiences is really taking off. And I gave a couple of examples in our prepared remarks, one such example is a National Cancer Institute. So if you think about what they're doing at NCI, they established a digital service center of excellence, and they've done that around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. And when you think about time to value, it's just 10 days, they were up and running with an online portal to collect and track specimens of COVID-19 patients. So we think that this is going to be a runaway success story for the company. And when you look at the year-on-year growth here and you look at the pipeline, we are extremely bullish on this business. Keith Weiss : Excellent. That\u2019s helpful. William McDermott : Thank you, Keith. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Karl Keirstead : If I could just ask you about the seasonality in subscription billings this year, maybe sort of a two parter. In terms of 2Q, it looks like your constant currency billings guide of 20%, that's about a 5-point step down from what you did in Q1, yet the 2Q compare, I think, is reasonably easy, given that was a tough quarter for everybody in software in the year ago period. And then in terms of the full-year billings guide, it looks like the constant currency guide is about 23% at the midpoint. Just to clarify, was it about 22% before? So you've, in fact, upped it by a percentage point or so, just to clarify? Thank you so much. Gina Mastantuono : Sure. So I'll take the first question on the Q2 billings and the deceleration from Q1. So first off, you can see in our IR deck that in Q1, we had $11 million in multi-year billings that we don't expect to occur in Q2. So that's part of the deceleration. As well, we talked about timing, and we've talked about this in the past and why billings is not the best metric, right, because if customers are co terming during the contract period, they often renew early, which changes the timing of renewals and really impact billings. And so one of the reasons why billings is not the greatest of metrics and why we are pointing to and giving guidance now for cRPO of 30% in Q2. What I would say is that we are, in fact, seeing a reacceleration of net new ACV in Q2, given the Q2 comp from last year. It's just that there is a lot of noise in billings. And so I just continue to really stress that we should be looking more at cRPO. And then for the full-year, it's about 28% normalized because remember, last year, we had the pull forward of $80 million of billings out of Q1 of 2021 and into Q4. And so the full-year guide, we have increased it by almost the full Q1 be that you're seeing. Karl Keirstead : Got it, okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Gina. Gina Mastantuono : A very welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe first on just the pipeline and the visibility to Bill. I'd love to just get a sense for how you're thinking about kind of the large strategic deals? I think there's a fear that last year, it was a time to really go and sell into the base and that there's not a lot of incremental monetization opportunity available in some of the large customers, but it does seem we're at least picking up in our checks, that couldn't be further from the truth and that there's a lot more strategic opportunity available. So maybe just first, I'd love to hear kind of your take on that, Bill. And then I've got a quick follow-up for Gina. William McDermott : Sure. Absolutely, Alex. First of all, when you look at the pipeline in my prepared remarks, I was very careful to point out that it's never been better than it is right now. And in fact, it's outstanding. And has a couple of driving forces here. One, if you look at EMEA as a theater, the EMEA business is smoking hot. And you saw 80% year-on-year growth in the first quarter out of EMEA. So let that be the first indicator that the brand is now alive and - we are operating extremely well through the Rolodex of EMEA and the CEOs across various industries and various mission-critical geographies are adopting us as the workflow standard. Continue to believe in EMEA as a great wellspring of growth to ServiceNow, and that was a big one for us to get really rolling. The other piece is APJ. We're seeing now outstanding growth out of APJ, and I would say the same is true for the brand. Now we're well known. We're on fire in Japan. As you know, Japan is an on-premise market and needs to move to the cloud. The workflow revolution is one great way to get them going in the cloud. I gave an example of that in my prepared remarks. We're also expecting better things that was with the leadership adjustment that we've made. We see South Korea doing extremely well. So I want you to believe in APJ is yet another well spring of growth that can go higher and higher with ServiceNow. We've always been strong in the Americas. The Americas had an extraordinary Q4, as you know, and they'll kick back into their normal growth rates at higher and be on course with where we wanted them to be at the end of Q2. So you add all that up in the geographic theaters and the business is in great shape. The other thing we've done is really focused on some breakthrough industries, financial services and telecommunications quickly come to mind, where once we get rolling, the Bowling alley effect takes effect very, very quickly here. And keep in mind, we're now in a global economy. That is shifting quickly to lights back on. Last year, GDP was down substantially in the global economy, yet digital transformation spend was up. This year as the economy comes back, they're not slowing down digital transformation spend, actually, it's also going up, but the economy is waking up. So what's gorgeous about this for us is we now have the CRM techniques of digital selling, combine it with the direct selling that always worked well. And some of the techniques that we've enabled also on inside selling and how we've taken the whole marketing value chain from the brand and communications to field marketing, industry specialization product marketing and then all the resources in the field to basically take that industry specific, value-driven story to the customer, and we've aligned that with our services organization, and an expansive ecosystem with all the big partners betting long on ServiceNow, setting up global practices with ServiceNow. So Alex, I've been in this business for 20 years. I've never seen an opportunity like this in my career, and I actually think we're just getting started. Alex Zukin : That's awesome. Thank you, Bill for that. And then maybe just a follow-up for Gina. So as we think about moving our forward-looking indicators to current RPO and RPO. I guess is it - can you maybe remind us of - are there any kind of quirks or seasonality or things we should keep in mind? Because I think some people are going to do change in RPO, which is a little bit harder when there's decimal places, quite frankly, to do it from. But anything we should keep in mind, you're guiding to that 30%. There's a little bit of FX tailwind there. Anything we should think about there? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. I mean the RPO is definitely a better guide, and there's less noise in it than billings, but there is noise. There's no perfect forward indicator for you. And so if you think about contracted upsells, for example, on the timing of renewals, that could impact cRPO. Additionally, self-hosted deals could potentially impact the RPO vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth. So there's no one perfect indicator, but cRPO is definitely a stronger indicator with less noise. So we will continue to guide one quarter out, and we'll continue to stress that. It has less noise and less confusion in it than the billings metric. Alex Zukin : Got it. Thanks, guys. Congrats. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. William McDermott : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Good to see the strong start of the year as well. Maybe on the federal side, just with the change in administration, I'm curious if there's been any change in either the demand environment there? Or if there's been a change in maybe the linearity of how we should think about federal and for that matter, state and local government deals this year as well? And then I have one follow-up. William McDermott : Yes. Thanks, Samad. It's actually very obvious that with a change in administration, everybody has to get their offices and get settled in place and budgets have to be allocated and so on. So we see the light turning on the business model at the federal level very strongly in Q2. And we expected that all along. So it makes up about 10% of our business now. So it's a big part of our business, and the pipeline is absolutely swelling, and it's swelling because of the change in administration. But the administration, as you know, is very focused on digital transformation because it's really the only way to run a much more refined, low cost, high delivery process for the constituents to put in office. So everybody is highly aware of that. And we do fantastic, as you know, in federal. And in fact, Homeland security, many other departments have chosen us a vaccine management just as one thing to give you. And state and local, we're doing really good and again, a groundswell of opportunity there. And I do believe as we go through Q2 and into Q3 and Q4, the deals will just get larger and the business will come in stronger as we go. We're doing great in federal, state and local. Unidentified Analyst : Very helpful. And then maybe, Gina, just as a follow-up for you. On the comment around the net new ACV accelerating, could you maybe help us understand -- bifurcate that from new ACV from new customers to ServiceNow versus new ACV from existing customers and how -- if either both of those are accelerating or just maybe how the timeline there looks? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. I would say that we were really pleased with new logo growth in Q1. We saw strong growth in our new logos and seven new customers greater than $1 million across several verticals, right, pharmaceutical, insurance, e-commerce, just to name a few. And most of these deals actually had 4-plus products. And so we are continuing to see good traction in the new logos and obviously existing as well. And so we saw -- we're not going to give you numbers, but I wanted to make sure, again, with billings noise that people understood that we saw strong net new ACV acceleration in Q1 and expect that as well in Q2 and throughout the year. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Good night. Gina Mastantuono : Bye, Samad. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Very much congratulations on the superb quarter, Bill and team. Bill, I have a question for you. It's been a year now since we've been working and running the business virtually. And so one end, you could argue that the deals that are getting close today hurdles that got into the system about a year back or so. Now as we remain virtual, how do you think about lead generation in driving the business for calendar '21 and beyond? And also given that you've had tremendous success selling virtually and rescaling the business virtually. This opening of the economy really have any benefits for ServiceNow incrementally speaking? For Gina, I'll save the follow-up. William McDermott : Kash, thank you very much for the question because it's a very important one. Somehow, some way, I actually think some people have this illusion that ServiceNow was advantaged because of COVID. And the truth is that is not the case. The truth is that we lean vaccine management on an emergency response, return to work in vaccine management level it was great for our brand. It was the right thing for our purpose, and it was wonderful in terms of expanding the inspiration of ServiceNow in the global economy. On a financial level, we, like everyone else, had to figure out a new way of connecting with customers. And in that environment, you'll always do better with your existing customers that already really like you and a loyal to you in terms of expanding your portfolio across your base. What you're going to see now is net new logos, net new ACV really kick up into high Gear at ServiceNow, which makes this such an exciting story because our sales force is a largely go-to-market direct sales force. And now they will be able to utilize all of those skills that have been built into that culture and are wired for perfection, really wired for perfection geographically, by industry and by Persona, and that will now be a new tailwind for the investors to enjoy as we progress in 2021. The lead generation, I tried to cover that earlier to, Kash, because I want to really make this clear. We have really refined the company in the context of generating leads. And what I mean by that is we took the brand. We ran a campaign today if you care to see it. You can look at the Wall Street Journal, and you'll see the Wanka campaign because we're letting the world know that the workflow revolution is on. And even the Willy Wonka chocolate factory can run better on the backbone of the ServiceNow platform. And we're educating a whole new generation around what workflow is really all about. And we've taken the brand, the communications, the field, the product marketing and align that to the industry, the GEO, the persona, the inside sales, the direct sales, and we're managing that funnel with a meticulous level of detail around machine learning and AI that manifests itself ultimately in a CEO dashboard, but we manage the whole company on a CRM level that is a really, really world class. In fact, I've never seen it anywhere at the depth of analytics who're running the business on Now. So the leads are not all equal. You have to understand how to manage the pipeline. You have to manage the noise in the pipeline. And as the economy opens up, those processes have been built now for industrial mass scale. So I want to let you know, watch net new ACV, watch net new logos, and watch this machine tick into higher on the back of Knowledge '21 and an already robust and swelling pipeline. We're really in great shape. Kash Rangan : It sounds like now we go. Gina, question for you. If Bill's take on how the economy opening up will have some implications, ramification. How much of that have you dive into guidance? Or are you keeping guidance relatively conservative, not taking into account all the upside that will -- as you talked about opening the economy that if it does materialize? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. I think that we feel really good about our guidance from top line to bottom line. I think the growth is strong, pipeline is good. From an operating margin perspective, it's strong, free cash flow at 30%. I mean, where are you seeing growth that you're seeing, top line and free cash flow margins of 30% with the scale that we're at. So we feel really good about the guidance. We feel really good about the growth, and we'll just continue to keep executing according to plan. Kash Rangan : Thank you so much. William McDermott : And Kash, one thing that's really interesting is when Gina talks about those numbers, which I totally agree with, let's keep in mind, it's organic. Kash Rangan : Absolutely. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Kash. William McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Michael Turits : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you so much. I have one for Bill and one for Gina. So Bill, a very big picture question, but a lot you've done to do more in automation with the Intellibot acquisition. There's a lot activity in that sector. I'd like to know where you think ServiceNow fits into that broader automation scheme with so many different types of players out there over the medium to long term? And Gina, I have one for you. William McDermott : Yes. Excellent question, Michael. Many of our customers are trying to drive automation. And they're trying to drive it across a mix of legacy and, of course, modern applications. And when you think about RPA, it's not a particularly differentiating technology, but it's particularly important for integrating with legacy applications that don't support API-based integrations. So what Intellibot does has a very strong experience in developing RPA solution and has existing product capabilities and technical talent that will help us accelerate and enhance our automation efforts. So think about it this way. Our focus is on delivering world-class automation and a platform we call the Now platform. And what we want to do is accelerate digital transformation. And RPA is a piece of that strategy. So RPA will extend our core ServiceNow workflows and it will automate certain repetitive tasks and it'll integrate with these legacy systems for basically intelligent end-to-end automation. And this is strengthened with our existing technologies, such as AI and ML. And as it relates to our participation in the open market, I can tell you that customers tell me that they feel like RPA has left them with islands of automation. And it's getting harder for them to manage as they scale, they're kind of hitting a wall. So what they're looking for is what we are providing, which is a single platform where workflow is the core engine that drives the process. And then they have a choice of the right automation technology for the use case, based on integrations, RPA, decision management or artificial intelligence. So what we'll give them is we'll give them something that's natively integrated into the Now platform. But for example, if you IPF or any other well-known RPA technology out there such as automation anywhere automation anywhere, if they're looking to work with them, that simply integrates into the Now platform. And they support us, and we support them because we're all on the size of the customer, and that's what really matters. And I really think this is a breakthrough a moment in this Q&A because we have taken that position with all participants in the market. But we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. What we do is we workflow end-to-end business processes, and we're automating work to make it work better for people. And if the customer has a certain vendor that they're working with, it integrates seamlessly within Now platform, it's okay. But there's a lot more of them that is saying, give it to me on one platform, make my life simple. I don't want islands of automation. I want a platform that really manages my business in a smart way. Either way the customer wants to work with us, we're happy to work with them. Michael Turits : And Gina, my question for you, in some sense, it may be an extension of what Kash was asking. But as you pointed out, you raised the guidance for subscription billings for the year by just under the 1Q raise. And there is still some -- even x the $11 million. There is some slight decel in the next quarter. So is there anything that is, in fact, holding you back from guidance that would have been higher at this point? Gina Mastantuono : No. The only reason why the full guide wasn't through to the full-year was we had some pull-through of billings from Q2 into Q1 of about $7 million. We feel really good about the guide and there's -- I mean, I think it's a strong guide throughout, and we're going to really see the seasonality, right? So Q2 and Q3, I tried to talk about that whereas we're seeing more and more billing being pushed into Q4, that's really what you're seeing here. We're seeing very strong acceleration of net new in Q2 as well as into Q3 and Q4. William McDermott : I think this is worth noting that, like, it's the way the customer wants to do business, right? So when they have a multiproduct contract, then they want to consume and combine and do all these things, we're just seeing the trend line go more towards the Q4 from a seasonality standpoint, but the good news is, and that's why I think Gina did a great job with changing kind of the nomenclature around this to RPO because that's what the customer wants -- we give the customer what they want and the timing that they want. But what I think our investors want out there is they want to know, are you guys getting new logos? Do you guys get net new ACV? Is your pipeline doing great? Do we have room to believe that this is a story that can keep delivering? And the answer to all those questions is yes, yes, yes. Michael Turits : Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Gina. William McDermott : My pleasure. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with BofA Securities. Brad Sills : Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One on the DevOps release, it's exciting because it really could further that evolution of ServiceNow as a custom apps platform. There's always been that potential for ServiceNow to play in that market. But primarily, the success has been in packaged applications, ITSM, ITOM, employee customer workflows. So my question is, is that the case? Does this DevOps solution accelerate the company's kind of move towards a custom apps platform. And given that, that's such a vast market, are there certain areas or cases that you might see success early? Thank you so much. William McDermott : Yes. I think that's a really insightful question for sure. When you think about what's going on, like I talked about discover in the prepared remarks, right, they were an early adopter of the Qu\u00e9bec release. And what they're doing is trying to give value back to the business. So this -- they shared that it's a better time to be a developer on the ServiceNow platform than ever before. Because they use the new user interface builder. And this capability has allowed them to basically create modern and data-rich applications at an incredible pace. And then at the same time, what you see happening is innovation at the edge of the enterprise. Like I'm the executive sponsor for one of the biggest banking customers in the world. They've got to modernize 5,000 applications. So as I saying to me is how can I, for my business people. Modernize an application really quick or build a net new application. So what you're seeing is this convergence now between the developers and the business people demanding innovation and change swiftly coming together on the Now platform. This business, I would not be surprised if it ends up being the biggest business we have. I see the money going to the cloud, whether it's multi-cloud platforms, it's SaaS platforms or its app innovation at the edge of the enterprise, and we are right there. And the fact that we can connect it across all the experience zones, all the way back to IT, security, DevOps, et cetera, gives us a unique competitive differentiation and competitive advantage. Brad Sills : That\u2019s great, Bill. Thank you so much. William McDermott : My pleasure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with [JPMorgan] Sterling Auty : With JPMorgan. Thanks, guys. Just one question from my side. So on those hard-hit industries, you called out airlines. So I'm just kind of curious, what percentage of those -- that roughly 20% of revenue in the hard-hit industries are in the airline use case where there's still a headwind versus the rest that maybe are starting to bounce back and maybe look at incremental investment for digital transformation? Gina Mastantuono : It's - yes. So thanks, Sterling. It's much, much smaller. It's less than 5%. And so we are really seeing a bounce back in the bulk of those industries that we've called out last year as being part of the 20%. And we talked about some really large deals in some of those verticals, including retail, entertainment, transportation and manufacturing in this quarter, as well as the renewal rates in those industries are actually higher. So what's really happening, as you can imagine, is these customers who have been harder hit, they're more focused than ever on reducing risk, taking out costs, driving productivity. And so they are leaning in even more heavily with ServiceNow before. And so I just wanted to make sure that people understood that not every customer is in that lucky position right now. And there are still some that are hard hit, and we continue to work with them and help them through it. But yes, the bulk of this industry are really bouncing back fairly well and really helping lean into this digital transformation that we're seeing. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we do have time for one more question from Derek Wood. Unidentified Analyst : Question back on the low-code side of the market. There certainly seems to be just a lot more market dialogue around low-code tools to accelerate transformation. And Bill, I'd love to hear who's championing these initiatives? And will you be looking to add new kinds of sales motions to target the citizen developer outside of IT? And then maybe if you could just touch on, I think, Qu\u00e9bec had a focus on advancing some low-code, anything to highlight there? Thanks. William McDermott : Yes. Sure. First of all, I would just remind you that like ServiceNow is positioning, enabling line of business users to develop workflow automation is really perfect. And we are at the kind of epicenter, I would say, of secular tailwinds, wins, which are forming around the convergence of IT and business, which I said earlier. So App modernization, operational transformation, IT in the business, they're all moving as quickly as possible to drive greater efficiency and more agility. This is a product already today where we have a very capable leader in engineering, Josh Conn, who's been with us now for some time. And when I first came in here, the first thing he said to me is, hey, I'm raising my hand. This could be big. And I said, we're going to get all behind you. So we already have specialists sales force that complement general line to make sure that we capitalize on this opportunity. And I think the reason that this opportunity is so smoke and hot right now is there just aren't enough developers to build the applications that the enterprise need to transform their business. So this huge unmet need in application delivery is really falling right on to the Now platform and these creative workflows are really driving the foundation of the partnership with our customers, tying together engineering and the business executives. So I would just say to you that we have -- we don't need to like hire new sales force to do this. We already got the specialist, we already got the great engineering, and our team really understands app engine. It really understands the platform, even the general line AE in the field sees this as a golden opportunity. And we've aligned all the empowerment levels and the compensation schemes and all the focus to be there because we know that's where the money is. Gina Mastantuono : I'll just add one thing, Derek, to say that the IT organizations are becoming more and more important here because the businesses, while -- yes, they bought these applications. The IT organization is responsible for ensuring they're safe, secure, right? And so the partnership between the business and IT is becoming stronger and stronger. And ServiceNow is the platform that's strategic to IT, trusted, scalable and secure. And it's a platform that IT is going to continue to use to build these mission-critical applications for the lines of business. And so really, we are very well positioned given our strategic relevancy in the suite with the CIO. William McDermott : And Derek, keep in mind, right, Gina is absolutely right. The company started at IT. So this is actually a core strength of ours. And then we move to the employee and the customer and now it's all about the app engine in sort of this low-code world that we see conversion between business and IT. Our company grew up there. It's now prime time because business is pulling at engineering and IT to say, I want my new modern application, and I want to now. So we're kind of right there. The other thing we probably could have covered in greater detail, but I think you already all know this, is this one architecture, one data model and one platform is really coming through strong now. Because most companies out there are either best-of-breed where they do one thing particularly well, but not many things, or they have many different platforms that aren't so well integrated. In our case, even as we put new innovation on the Now platform, it's all integrated, and it all works. So folks are really excited about that within these enterprises because they got a lot riding on whatever they invest in working, pleasing people, delivering a positive ROI, and really making the decision-makers that invest in the platform look good because there's no tech debt with ServiceNow. Unidentified Analyst : Great. We can't wait to see the Waka campaign, too. But thanks for all. William McDermott : Thank you very much. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the call over to your first speaker today Lisa Banks, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may begin your conference. Lisa Banks : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for ServiceNow\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our second quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance is based on information as of July 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distances and other mitigation requirements. The continued impact of COVID-19 on customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020 for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations or RPO and current RPO or cRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and our investor presentation. These and all prior press releases and investor presentation are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25% and the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51 up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year, an incredible performance by our team and exceptional first half. And we have unstoppable momentum and we\u2019ve reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board. Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3 times faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do or die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind. We are giving customers the innovative solution they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world\u2019s biggest challenges [are service now] [(ph), as big as the opportunities, from vaccine management to ESG to the new world of hybrid work. Whatever the challenge work flows with ServiceNow. We\u2019ve created a new market. One that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today\u2019s digital business demands. The Now platform, the platform of platforms delivers workflow automation, where the consumers raise user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across the enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business in every industry, serving every persona. The power of the Now platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world. For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges and maintaining on target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and they are dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage this complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain. It\u2019s just one example of the power of the Now platform. I\u2019d like to share an overview of our success of core ServiceNow\u2019s portfolio. Let\u2019s begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 16 of our top 20 deals with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million. Our AI powered service operations is resonating big time with customers. We saw great wins with leading companies, including Travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They\u2019re working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we\u2019re honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts and it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. MPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience. With employee workflows we make work better by driving outstanding employee experience that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere, while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now platform provides employees a system of action for key events, including onboarding, parental leave, moving, and many more moments that matter for people, employee workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million. [Asahi] (ph) for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. With customer workflows, we\u2019re creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that we define customer operations for greatest speed, agility, transparency, and convenience all while working with existing systems. Customer workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals with four deals over $1 million. We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. Deutsche Telekom is leveraging ServiceNow\u2019s telecommunications solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process enabling a 360 degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure creating a seamless connected experience for DT\u2019s employees and customers. With creative workflows, we\u2019re accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences. IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than three months using ServiceNow\u2019s low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2 creative workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. Nokia picked ServiceNow\u2019s creative workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms. These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now buying program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility all while improving business impact, continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now buying program with Deloitte, who will take advantage of our old products suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients, while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business. Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft teams, regardless of the employee\u2019s location in the hybrid work environment. In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team passion to solving the world\u2019s greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business. In our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It\u2019s been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It\u2019s a privilege to help the world reopen and safely returned to the workplace. We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society\u2019s biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. We are better than we were yesterday not as good as will be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And I look forward to taking your questions. But first, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metric. The team demonstrated exceptional execution and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. Q2 subscription revenues was $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of a 450 basis points tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligation or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a $4.3 billion versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year. Q2 subscription billing to $1.328 billion representing 30% year-over-year growth by $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance, FX and duration where 500 basis points of tailwind year-over-year. We saw growth across all our industry categories, financial services and manufacturing are particularly strong across the globe driven by investments in business continuity. Industry is impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. The Now platform remains a mission critical part of our customer\u2019s operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness that our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land and expand growth strategy. This was evident that the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers payments over $1 million in ACV of 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we close 51 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We\u2019re also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year. Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio, instead of selling point products continues to drive more multiproduct deals. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. Turning to profitability, operating margin was 25%, three points above our guidance driven by the strong revenue beat G&A cost saving and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. And we\u2019ve heard from Bill, the macro trends starting digital transformation or significant opportunity for ServiceNow. Our Knowledge 2021 event in May, included two amazing weeks of keynote, panels and discussion that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics. This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and healthcare industry product and showcase the power and endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflow. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account without 45% year-over-year. Together, the macro tailwind and interest generated from knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We\u2019re raising our subscription revenues outlook by $73 million at the midpoint point to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind. We are raising our subscription billings outlets by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes in that tailwind and FX duration, 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85% and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top-line growth, more efficient marketing spend and stayed in some continued lower G&A expenses related to COVID. We are raising our full year of 2021 free cash margin by one point from 30% to 31%. I\u2019ve note that from a seasonality perspective, we\u2019re expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including 150 basis points FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 150 basis points FX tailwind. We expect subscription billing between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes the net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings in the four quarter rolling basis, we\u2019ll help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms. On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity. ServiceNow is a digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business and we are well on our way to becoming $15 billion revenue company. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team\u2019s performance this quarter and Bill and I can\u2019t thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication. And with that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, congrats on a very strong second quarter. Bill, can you talk a little bit to the growing pipeline that you kind of mentioned here on the call? Just talk a little bit about sales cycles, I would assume that helping you this year, but also kind of sets the foundation for next year. Just any color there would be nice. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Sure. Thank you very much, Raimo, for the question. First, I\u2019d like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership, as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company, because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever all the systems even exist in the company, I couldn\u2019t pick out of a lineup, because only thing we look at as Now, ServiceNow. And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that\u2019s moving in the global economy. And I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust. And it has substantially grown and the lights are all green. Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year as is our engineering leader and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina\u2019s value and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart, because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information. It\u2019s very, very strong. In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT is the stronghold on so many things now, because if you want to give the employees a great experience that you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT business around creating these new workflows, which is necessary, because there\u2019s not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required. Everybody can agree on the Now platform and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. And then any early feedback from the customers around Lightstep, because that\u2019s obviously like expanding your TAM quite a bit, what has been the early feedback from the customer base. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Yes, I really like to thank Ben and his team for their trust in ServiceNow, and Pablo and CJ and our great engineering team for the work that they\u2019re doing together. What we think is that ServiceNow has proven capabilities combined with Lightstep\u2019s observability technology will really help organizations seamlessly connect, because that\u2019s the big deal, seamlessly connect the insights in that data form the necessary patterns in that data. And then action them into the workflow which enables people process and technology to truly deliver great experiences for the customers and the employees and I think what differentiates us uniquely is this is one pane of glass. It\u2019s one user experience, and it is not just the developer operations, you\u2019ll also see business executives align on this as well. And to us that\u2019s going to really help organization seamlessly connect their digital experiences across the enterprise. Again, the platform I can\u2019t stress this enough, the digital platform, the Now platform is the glue that\u2019s tying it all together. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Well done. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Hey guys. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talked about the power of the platform with really a consumer grade interface, but also I think the simplifying buying process new ELAs is really powerful and you called out Deloitte, I guess I wanted to double-click on that a bit and really the importance of this simplifying buying process and how you see that benefiting really new account acquisition as well as expansion. Bill McDermott : Yes, absolutely Matt. The main thing is speed, right. We\u2019re in a market that is very robust. Digital transformation is really hot and we are that signature brand. So the more quickly we can evolve the upgrade process and the net new deals to get customers live, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal. So when you think about the Now buying program, we\u2019re looking at larger rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process as you rightly point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation, our innovators, they\u2019re just so amazing here. Every time you turn around and the next release is a new breakthrough, I just can\u2019t thank them enough. ITSM Pro and enterprise are doing terrific, and this is enabling customers to try things as well. And exchange or adopt products at their will, and it\u2019s giving them a forward look at where we\u2019re going with our roadmaps. And when they see the innovation powered ServiceNow that actually buys them in very quickly. And finally, I would just like to say, we\u2019ve done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company, but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure that the customer understands the value they realized. So as they step in to bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success support and value, and they can carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say, this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you; I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today, where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems that they standardized on the Now platform. So it\u2019s just really good for the customer and it\u2019s good for our folks too to get the customer to value fast. Matt Hedberg : Makes sense. Maybe just a quick one for Gina. Last quarter, you talked about net new ACV acceleration, and I guess maybe I can assume based on your increased guidance, what the answer is, be curious if you have any thoughts on net new ACV. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So I talked about net new ACV accelerating in 2021 versus 2020. And we have definitely seen that happening across the board and with our strong beat in Q2 and our raise in the back-half the acceleration that we\u2019re seeing is actually greater than initially anticipated. Matt Hedberg : Great to hear. Thanks a lot, guys. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Matt. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much and hearty congratulations on another spectacular quarter. I couldn\u2019t help, but notice that the net new ACV contribution from your core IT business \u2013 workflow business was up very sharply, curious to get your thoughts on what\u2019s happening in that segment of the market. And Bill, I also noticed that the headcount in sales and marketing also went up pretty significantly. Can you just talk about, what the implications are for number one, the increase in net new business coming from your core business, coupled with what seems to be a pretty gigantic increase in sales and marketing, which I guess is a positive. But I just want you to give me the implications of these two observations. Thank you so much and congrats. Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much Kash. And thank you for all the things that you saw in the Now platform and our leadership in the market, I really appreciate it. In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos. So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers. Because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent, they want to leverage other technologies that they\u2019ve already invested in, of course, we\u2019re so accommodating to that, because our great engineers have built all out of the box integrations to the biggest systems in the world. So it\u2019s kind of started with the core and now it\u2019s moving across the enterprise with great speed and all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans and they\u2019re all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry is amazing. So I would just like to give you a feel for this Kash by just saying, like, we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation core as we expand the perimeter to employee and customer service management and now creator our great sales leadership sees the opportunity and they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline. And we\u2019re trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model. And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that\u2019s a high class situation, because most companies are complaining about the [war on] (ph) talent and they\u2019re actually suffering because they don\u2019t have enough talented people to do the job. We\u2019re only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow and the hardest part our recruiting team\u2019s doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes. So I think it\u2019s great that we\u2019re actually hiring ahead. We see a great hockey stick in the pipeline and I have tremendous confidence in our sales leadership all over the world. Kash Rangan : Thank you, brilliant. Thank you so much. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So I want to ask a similar question in that, around the ELA cycle and the deals that you talked about. Can you comment on how common that is for your pipeline right now versus maybe in previous years and give us a sense for the kind of magnitude of upsell that is possible when customers move at an accelerated pace to these enterprise buying activities. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Alex. I mean, the good news is, it\u2019s early \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very small part of our results and a very, very small part of our pipeline. So the upside for this initiative and this way of thinking is quite dramatic. Because if you think about enterprise solution selling and you do that in all the geos and all the industries, and you really establish a relationship plan with the customers at the C level, that\u2019s quite convincing, you could do a lot. And what we could also do is get customers resonating with this and really lock them into the idea of a future roadmap. So they become a design partner. And that\u2019s really what we want. We don\u2019t want sales, we want partnerships. So if we have design partnerships to go three to five years, we\u2019re buying into the roadmap and we\u2019re doing that giving the customer all the benefits of scale and innovation that they deserve from ServiceNow. And at the same time, we\u2019re investing less calories in selling things and more calories on building relationships that last a lifetime. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add Alex that on that while it\u2019s still small, the current expansion that we\u2019re having with our customers, who are going through this buying, we\u2019re going to pretty significant. So we\u2019re really happy with it. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And then just maybe one follow-up for you, Gina, if you look at the guidance on a constant currency basis, can you give us a sense, just, I mean, clearly Q3 is a big federal quarter and everything we\u2019ve heard to gesture federal pipeline is quite robust. Can you give us some puts and takes around the guardrails or the conservatism and the guidance that takes that strong federal pipeline into account? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Great question. We absolutely are expecting another strong federal quarters this year. But if you remember on a quarterly basis, there\u2019s a lot of seasonality built into billing. And so as we shared in the past, there\u2019s a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal invoice timing, and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter of Q3 is at some of our customers are becoming larger. They\u2019ve requested a change in annual semi bill \u2013 the semiannual billing and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year. As we had two large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020, that are now being invoiced sending an annual. So that\u2019s actually resulting in two point headwind to the year-over-year growth. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I talked about the four quarter rolling number and if you look at four quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect the strong federal quarter, we absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new and we are feeling really good about Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance. Bill McDermott : And Alex, if I could build on Gina\u2019s outstanding commentary, I would just say there\u2019s many big opportunities in the back end of the year, in federal, in particular. And the attending to be large programs, as opposed to smaller point solutions. And again, this is more or less the theme now as we\u2019ve become an enterprise solutions company and you\u2019re seeing business in the area of resiliency, there\u2019s a lot of focused on business continuity now outages of course, and dealing with the COVID scenario, cyber security is on the top of many lists and programs that we\u2019re involved in and vaccine management. Vaccine management is one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces. And as you can tell, they\u2019ll likely need to be readministering things regularly and managing that process, where our front and center on that. And of course, I\u2019m really proud actually of the way the government is looking at digital transformation. They really are looking at this as a way to help government run like business. And there\u2019s a lot of really smart operators on the technology side that I\u2019ve met in many of the large programs and our team is very humble to have an opportunity to help not only the United States, but many of the governments around the world is really exciting. Alex Zukin : Makes total sense. And Gina, this is why we\u2019re all very thankful that you\u2019re now guiding to current RPO, where these issues probably don\u2019t \u2013 are less impactful. Gina Mastantuono : Exactly. Exactly. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay. Thanks very much for taking the question. Bill, should we construe the strong Q2 results in your bullish pipeline commentary to mean that you\u2019ve clearly begun to benefit more from the economy reopening. And then also, how do you see that playing out over the back half of the year? Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Gregg. Certainly, I think it\u2019s beginning to show in the results and I have to say, part of my belief is that as the economy opens up even more. That can only benefit ServiceNow even more. We have done a great job and I really do take my hat off to our team and all functions of the company to stay focused on the customer and digital only world is not an easy thing to do. And ServiceNow employees that stood up to the challenge. But now as the economies open up and people are back in the office and there is a hybrid world that we\u2019re all accommodating, I do believe getting our sales professionals and executives in front of other executives is only going to help the story resonate even more. So the important thing I believe is that we all learn something from COVID and we recognize what\u2019s essential in terms of travel and accommodating personal meetings versus what is more adequately handled using tools that are digital and can be scaled even faster. And it\u2019s the combination of those two forces that I think will really lift ServiceNow actually to new heights, Gregg. Gregg Moskowitz : That\u2019s great. Thanks, Bill. And then just one for Gina, I think your subscription gross margins are a bit lower than they\u2019ve been in awhile. Is there anything that you would call that here? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, the margins we talked about there, we were keeping them flat to our guys that they are impacted versus the prior year a bit. And we talked about this earlier in the year when making increased investment in our data centers and customer support to serve customers impacted by the new data residency regulations, as well as serving our customers who require additional security measures such as IL-5 for our fed customers. So those are the big ticket items that are impacting our margin that was included in our original dive for the year. And we are achieving exactly what we set out to do on both those funds. Gregg Moskowitz : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia. Your line is open. Arjun Bhatia : Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I want to start off maybe with the new customers, is it clearly seems like there\u2019s strong traction there and your platform is broader than it used to be many years ago. I\u2019m wondering how many of your new customers are coming in off of that outside of your core IT workflows in HR, in customer service management. Are you seeing traction there from new customers or was that mostly a point of expansion from existing customers? Bill McDermott : That\u2019s a really good question, Arjun. What we\u2019re seeing is, ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world and creative workflows and customer service management and employee experience. And we are built big businesses within our company in these categories. So it\u2019s not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the employee experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that frankly can accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that\u2019s going to be everywhere. And we uniquely serve that need with that consumer grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others. And I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace and yes, new deals beginning with employee experience. The same thing on customer service management. We\u2019re now in a direct-to-consumer digital first world and the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service. And that is our focus and there\u2019s many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking, not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us data. And I really want to stress this create a workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you\u2019re going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there, because what\u2019s happening is they have to start with the low-code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying in to a unified platform like ServiceNow, and ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market. And that\u2019s what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation. So we\u2019ve seen new deals and creator and customer and employee, not just starting with IT. And yes, that is kind of a new frontier. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re very bullish on the company. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add on that really pleased with our new customer growth. We talked about it in the script about five new customers, just this quarter, over $1 million, and that\u2019s across several different industries. And all of those five customers actually purchased five or more products. So cross-platform, it\u2019s quite amazing. And so I still talks about IT certainly continues to be a high percentage of our new logos, but we\u2019re seeing more and more, a high percentage of land with TSM, app engine and HR. So really, really pleased with the progress there. Bill McDermott : Absolutely. Arjun Bhatia : Perfect. That\u2019s great to hear. And one more, if I can follow-up on Gregg\u2019s question about reopening, I\u2019m curious if the delta variant or any impact from that is coming up in your conversations with customers and whether this is something that you\u2019re factoring, if you\u2019re factoring that into guidance at all at this point or if it\u2019s still too early to bake in any impact from impact of verticals on that front? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And certainly first and foremost, our greatest concern is always for the health and wellbeing of our people and our hearts go out to all those affected. And we definitely having conversations with customers, but with that said our business model is extremely resilient and predictable. We have a very robust backlog RPO exiting Q2 at $9.5 billion. And we talked about pipeline, right our pipeline continues to look really strong and our coverage ratio is better than the same time last year. So that\u2019s definitely off getting any potential conversion rates that might come under pressure. So I feel extremely confident in our guide right now. And we\u2019re certainly seeing the acceleration of digital transformation as hybrid environment, continuing to accelerate itself feels very strong about the guide. Arjun Bhatia : Great. Congrats again. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really nice quarter as well. I want to ask a kind of a higher level question. What are the \u2013 investor debates going on right now is relative strength in the market of back office applications versus front office with most investors thinking that that most of the focal point is on the front office. You guys see both sides of the equation. So Bill, can you give us some indication on sort of whether there\u2019s a relative more strength in the front office and back office or how you\u2019re seeing that market environment right now. Bill McDermott : That\u2019s a really important question. One of the things that\u2019s really, really interesting Keith is, it\u2019s neither a back nor front office world anymore. It actually is both and that\u2019s the big change in the enterprise. And that\u2019s why the Now Platform is uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers on our ecosystem, because it actually ties the front and the back together. And that\u2019s the big aha, so many enterprise participants and I\u2019ve been in the enterprise for awhile made their success at a being good in functional domains with shrink wrapped software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it and then eco systems evolve on top of that. But what happened, especially in this hybrid work from anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do or die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT for that\u2019s absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance. And it has to serve the business and then the business is pulling at IT to serve it. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing, in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress. So I think having a great front office employee experience and having a great front office customer service management and a great career workflow is tied to that resilient core. It\u2019s really resonating so big time. And the other thing is, it\u2019s really nice to speak well of all the market participants, because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful. So that Now Platform is really thinking in as the platform for digital business and that\u2019s really what we dreamed of and it\u2019s happening. Keith Weiss : Got it. And if I think one last one, I think it kind of dovetails what you are talking about in terms of working well with the other market participants. And it\u2019s kind of more of a question on the other side, I\u2019ve always thought of your ITSM solution is kind of the backbone within the IT department, which everybody integrates into. And one of those major integrations has been the observability vendors in the states. I\u2019ve always heard them talk about sort of as not being one of the most requested integrations on their platform, but now you\u2019re going to start competing with these guys. So how do you balance being that good partner as the backbone within IT, but also starting to emerge as more of a competitor and observability? Bill McDermott : I think it\u2019s very important to acknowledge that it\u2019s not about competing with the other participants in the market. It\u2019s about innovating on the Now Platform and giving the customer as much innovation as we possibly can. So they can conduct their business processes and their workflows on the Now Platform. To the extent, there are functionalities or investments that have been made in other participants in the market. We\u2019re very happy to integrate with them and accentuate that functionality into our Now Workflow. So the customer gets the best of all worlds. I will tell you that there are many customers that absolutely tell us that we want [Technical Difficulty] Keith Weiss : \u2026to particular functional areas who intervene it means and that\u2019s it. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much for the question, Keith. Hey look, the reality is we\u2019re the only born in the cloud so for a company to have eclipsed $5 billion in revenue without large M&A. We\u2019re highly aware of that. But we also aware that this is a very unique culture and this sales \u2013 for engineers is really in a league of its own and we continue to run the playbook again innovation. And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day, when we said we\u2019d be a $15 billion plus revenue company. Having said that, RPA, and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn\u2019t expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also be an open and willing partner for the customers because it\u2019s really about solving their problems. And the biggest thing I hear from them is, they\u2019ve got lots of good points solutions all over the place. And that in effect is the root cause of a lot of the mess that\u2019s been created in these enterprises. And more and more when I talk to leaders of companies and spent quite a bit of time during that this year, they tell me that they\u2019re looking for that control tower, that, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable that workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations, and enable their people to serve their customers. And really that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So I\u2019ll always keep bringing it back to, we can get where we said, we\u2019d go organically. We\u2019re always on our tippy toes, looking at what\u2019s best for our customers and our shareholders. And we always look at that. But right now, the plan is ever steady and there are no plans to acquire in the space that you mentioned. Keith Weiss : All right. Many things, Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much for the question too. Thank you, Keith. Operator : And your next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke : Yes. Thanks for the question. Bill, last quarter you talked about the EMEA business, I think you said it was on fire and clearly it\u2019s nice to see the uptick in EMEA as a percentage of revenue. Curious how that\u2019s evolved this quarter, obviously there\u2019s kind of some mixed trends over there as it relates to reopening. But just wanted to see what if you\u2019re seeing that momentum carry into Q2 and your thoughts there for the back half of the year. Bill McDermott : Yes. EMEA is doing fabulous. And one of the big changes that we\u2019ve made in EMEA was obviously the proper leadership, not just that the immediate ahead level, which is now obviously working extremely well and very proud of that, but also in significant countries within EMEA, because as you know, every country in Europe has its own unique culture, its own unique business motions, and you have to be strong with leadership and all of the geographies. And we\u2019re able to attract and retain the very best people in the enterprise software industry. I think that\u2019s one of the root causes of our success. The second would be our C-level relationships. We have upped our game and instead of dealing with only the CIO, which is an incredibly important executive to us. We have also created relationship plans across the C-suite and really enabled the platform strategy for our customers. And I think that\u2019s the big evolution of ServiceNow in EMEA. We\u2019ve become a platform company there as well. So it\u2019s kind of exciting when you consider how talk to Europe has had it with COVID and the travel restriction to do as well as we are. And can you imagine when things do loosen up and open up a little bit, just how big this is going to get in Europe for us. So we\u2019re very excited. The business is going great. And in EMEA, just so, if the head of the first half operating plan, the internal operating plan and that\u2019s a really good sign. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add to there that only did EMEA do well. We had really strong performance across all regions, Americas and APJ as well. So we\u2019re really feeling good from a geography perspective that, that we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders. Tyler Radke : Great. And just as making a quick follow-up. So I think you talked about Creator workflows, being an 18 in the top 20 deals, which was more than both ITSM and ITOM, but it did a down tick from 20% of net new ACV to 14% this quarter. I was curious if there\u2019s anything to call out there, whether it was just smaller creator deal sizes, or it was just the IPPs was so strong this quarter. Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll take that. So platform had a very strong quarter and you\u2019re right in 17 of our top 20 deals, including one deal over $1 million. Q1, we closed some seven figure, multiple seven figure Creator workflow deals, which were unusually large and more than we typically see in one particular quarter. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a shift queue. In Q2, we really basically went back to a more normalized run rate of the 14%, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing. I know that back in financial Analyst Day in May, we talked about the fact that we expect creative workflows becomes 20% of net new ACV by 2024. And we\u2019re well on our way and are doing extremely well in that trajectory. So we feel really good about the performance. And then Bill, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything on the actual strategy behind. Bill McDermott : No. I think you did a great Gina. And I think you also acknowledged all of our regional leaders and I like to acknowledge all of our regional leaders along with you, it\u2019s a great thing, and also our leadership executive team here and all the folks in engineering that have worked tirelessly to build the most innovative platform in the world is truly an honor to be associated with these folks. And I\u2019m so bullish on creative workflow. And I truly believe that the new motion in the enterprise, it\u2019s not going to be in a separate endeavors of innovation. It\u2019s going to be the unification of innovation. And the big organizations are going to insist on enterprise coherence and security and business process alignment, and the CEOs of very involved in digital transformation, the CEOs that are out there, some of the greatest leaders I\u2019ve ever seen, and they\u2019re very focused on digital first and they\u2019re not going to let these enterprises do whatever they want to do. So the companies that have true platforms that are acknowledged in the strategy room of the Board of Directors of given companies are going to do very well now. And the ones that are trying to get there, you better have a really great story on how you\u2019re going to take care of all the needs of the enterprise and not just a few needs of a specific silo. Operator : And we will be taking one more question from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Just one question from my side, you mentioned the improvement in the hardest hit industries from the pandemic. I\u2019m curious, what are these industries prioritizing in terms of their spend with ServiceNow and how durable do you expect that spending to be moving forward? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, great question. We\u2019re really pleased with the trajectory there and that they are returning to more normalized spending habits. The areas that I can call out most are really around business resilience and how do they make sure that they are extremely well positioned, as we come out of this pandemic to help their employees be more productive in a hybrid world to really help ensure that their operations are as resilient as possible. So that\u2019s throughout our IT, whether it\u2019s ITOM and ITAM together or ITBM as well as risk and security. So really across the board feeling really good about the fact that, that, that\u2019s opening up again. Bill McDermott : And I would build on Gina\u2019s comments Sterling by also saying that the speed of digital business right now is faster than I think any of us could have even imagined. And they\u2019re all talking seamless customer experience. And when you have to have a seamless customer experience to win, you have to align the value chain across the entire enterprise to earn that customer loyalty. And what you see in a lot of these companies is the middle office operations and just how manual these processes are and just how fractured the data is. So we\u2019re really good in getting the data organized and focused and put into a workflow so you can align the business process and you can be more resilient, but at the same time, you can enable this direct-to-consumer relationship. I mean, when was the last time anyone on this call went into a bank, everything is done on the mobile. Everything is direct-to-consumer. Everything has to happen with a gorgeous, simplified UI. And I think that is really driving so much of the conversations we\u2019re in right now. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : And due to time constraints, that will be our last question. And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines. Goodbye.",

And welcome to our Q3 earnings call. While a beat and raise headline from ServiceNow is familiar, it is no less extraordinary. Our team delivered another outstanding quarter, yet again, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31% organically. This is unprecedented in our Industry. CRPO was up 32%, subscription billings were up 28%. Operating margin was 26%. We again have raised our guidance for the full year, strengthening our clear path to 15 billion plus in revenue by 2026. I was introduced to ServiceNow CEO more than 2 years ago. We've all seen a lot since then. What we've never seen, is such consistent innovation and execution at global scale. Thanks to our customers, employees, and partner, we're well on our way to becoming that defining enterprise software Company of the 21st Century. And we're only getting started. Before Gina gives you a complete report, let's talk about this dramatic structural incline at ServiceNow. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. IDC has consistently sized this opportunity at 7.8 trillion over a 4-year period. With its massive addressable market, ServiceNow is at the intersection of 2 generational opportunities. First, the need for new technology foundation is supercharging our close partnership with [Indiscernible]. A recent Wall Street Journal report highlighted the role of [Indiscernible] as the architects of digital business. Ongoing advances in public Cloud and machine learning, are for forging a new era of software innovation.  Technology teams want a fully integrated software cycle; planning, development, deployment, operations, and service. ServiceNow, is leading this 20th to 21st Century migration for our customers. The Now platform with its immense versatility and scalability, has become the control tower for digital transformation. With second dimension fueling ServiceNow is the reordering of the enterprise application platforms for hyper automation. Leaders today recognize their technology architecture is their business architecture. Over several decades, enterprise that invested trillions is on-premise and first-generation SaaS applications. These applications satisfied the business process needs of the 20th century.  Today, new business models require a fully connected value chain. Legacy environments are not adaptive enough to enable this change. As the pioneer of modern digital workflows ServiceNow, in leading the renaissance. The Now platform connects different applications and data sources to create intuitive, mobile experiences all at a consumer grade. We don't ask businesses to bet everything on a single system or collaboration tool. We get choice, which not only unlocks value from our platform, but from other platform investments as well. ServiceNow also empowers anyone to build applications on our platform. In it's low-code development technologies report, Gartner estimates that 70% of new applications developed by 2025 will use low-code, or no code technologies.  Gartner, also named ServiceNow as a leader in its Magic Quadrant. These tailwinds are driving fast organic growth across our entire solutions portfolio. The number of deals greater than a million dollars was 63 up 50% year-over-year, signaling substantial adoption of our platform strategy. In Q3, IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 18 of our top 20 deals, while IT operations management, had 10 deals over a million. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is in a multi-year digital transformation effort. In Q3 they chose ServiceNow to consolidate 12 complex systems into a single platform so support the agencies mission critical operations. Demand for our entire IT portfolio is strong.  And with the launch of Light step incident response in Q3, we're unlocking a new wave of product lead growth in application monitoring and observability. Employee Workflows also had a fantastic quarter, with HR in 13 of our top 20 deals. In Q3, NTT data will leverage the Now platform to create an employee experience portal enhancing productivity for hybrid work, and managing vaccine administration for it's entire workforce. Momentum continues for customer workflows, with CSM in 12 of our top 20 deals, and 8 deals over a million. Industry Verticals Solutions are leading the way with major brands. Verizon is adopting our Telco Solution, American Century, our financial services solutions, and Sunbelt Health, our healthcare solutions.  Creator workflows which helps businesses build their own applications was exceptional in Q3, in 18 of our top 20 deals. We're partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring ServiceNow as new manufacturing vertical solution with App Engine to change how they serve their customers. Together, we're maximizing facility up time and delivering great experiences to distributors, dealers, and end consumers. Fujitsu will also expand it's use in the Now platform to drive its own digital transformation. we couldn't be prouder that Uber, Honeywell, Trulia, and many others all chose ServiceNow in Q3. This is a complete performance for the Company. Strong growth across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific Japan.  As we look to a strong finish in 2021 and beyond, here are a few of the many factors giving us great confidence in this business. First, while a lot of talent is raging out there, we're highly encouraged by the colleagues choosing ServiceNow in record numbers. Our new joiners together with our amazing global workforce, are building a uniquely inclusive, driven, and happy culture. We're also seeing major developments and our partner ecosystem. Just 3 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Celonis.  Celonis will deliver process mining insights, ServiceNow will build better workflows, our customers will gain from the integrated approach. We also defend our long-standing partnership with Microsoft. ServiceNow's employees center, can now be directly embedded in Microsoft Teams, reaching 250 million monthly users. Together with our expanding partner community, we will reduce complexity to make work better for people. Finally, innovation without disruption is a hallmark of our best-in-class engineering tradition. When we stay without disruption, we mean invisible.  A seamless upgrade experience for our customers. In our Now platform roam release, we delivered countless new features to customers. Including, mobile app builder, an automation discovery tool, employee journey management, and new customer service play box. Every business leader in the world, is looking at the future and work. These new features give the Now platform even more capability to build that hybrid future. I'll refer to a comment made by industry analyst, Josh Passon (ph), who said, our own platform release. This Company seems to be able to build and deploy enterprise software faster than almost any I've ever seen and that's why they are juggernaut. Josh, naturally, I agree. In closing, the Company as firing on all cylinders, the quarter speaks for itself. We beat again, we raise again. The secular tailwinds are at our backs. Our customer base is expanding, just as our customer NPS is increasing. Our partner ecosystem is fired up. We accelerated our timeline to be net 0. We help businesses drive their own ESG initiatives on our platform with a major release. The list goes on and on. Overall, our message to the market couldn't be any clearer. Whatever systems, challenges, or opportunities you have, however fast you need to move, you have a trusted innovator in ServiceNow. We want to make the world work better for everyone, and we'll never lose our focus on the privilege that comes with saying, \"The world works with ServiceNow. \" I look forward to your questions. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you Bill. Q3 was another fantastic quarter with continued out-performance across all of our growth and profitability guidance metrics. Demand was strong globally across all 3 of our GEOS. The consistency of our results quarter-after-quarter exemplifies the strength of our product portfolio, and it seems focused on building deep customer relationships. Q3, subscription revenues of $1.43 billion, $22 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of 100 basis points tailwind from FX. RPO ended the quarter at approximately 9.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth.  Current RPO was approximately 5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth and a 2 point beat versus our guidance. Currency did not have an impact on year-over-year growth. Q3 subscription billings of 1.38 billion representing 28% year-over-year growth and a $55 million beat versus the high-end of our guidance. Assets and duration were 150 basis points tailwind year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across the industries we serve with transportation and logistics and business services, seeing particularly robust net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a healthy 98% in Q3, a testament to the value ServiceNow delivers to our customers. We view our relationship with customers as long-term partnerships, and we continually innovate to provide new solutions to address their evolving business needs. The land in expand motion has manifested into a base of 1,266 customers paying us over 1 million in ACV of 25% year-over-year. As the breadth of our portfolio and the addressable opportunities end have expanded, so too have our deal sizes. Because 63 deals greater than 1 million net new ACV in the quarter up over 50% year-over-year. And in Q3, all of our top 20 deals included 4 or more products. Turning to profitability.  Operating margin was 26%, 3 points above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. We also saw savings from the delay and return to work and lower travel. Our free cash flow margin is 15%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty, and significant applies to be gained. By delivering more intelligent automation that provides even better experiences, we are well positioned as the workflow standard on our journey to becoming a $15 billion plus revenue Company.  Turning to guidance, we're raising our guidance for the full year. We're raising our subscription revenues outlook by 32 million at the midpoint to a range of 5.565 billion to 5.57 billion representing 30% year-over-year growth, including 200 basis points of FX tailwind. We're raising our subscription billings outlook by 61 million at the midpoint to a range of 6.379 billion to 6.384 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes a net tailwind from [Indiscernible] and duration of 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85%, and we're raising our full-year 2021 operating margins from 24.5% to 25%.  This reflects the increase in our top-line growth and savings from the delay of [Indiscernible] work and lower travel. We're also raising our full-year 2021 free cash flow margin by 50 basis points from 31% to 31.5%. And we expect diluted weighted average upsetting shares of 202 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between 1.515 billion and 1.52 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a negligible impact from FX. We expect the RPO growth of 27% year-over-year. This includes the 150 basis points FX headwind due to the sharp movements recently in the euro and pound. On a constant currency basis, we expect the RPO growth to be 28.5%. We expect the system billing between 2.305 billion and 2.301 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in Q4 of 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes the net headwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. We expect an operating margin on 22%, which includes accelerated demand generation spend in the quarter to set us up for a strong start in 2022.  And we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, the pace of digital investment is accelerating and ServiceNow is rising up to seize the opportunities before us. The team has never been more engaged and focused on serving the enormous needs of our customers. And as ServiceNow becomes the defining enterprise software Company of the 21st century, we are also remaining steadfast in our goal to create positive impact in the world.  I'm happy to announce that in September we committed to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, 2 decades earlier than our previous goal. We've never been prouder of our employees and they're continued focus on serving our customers, partners, and community. As they make not only work, work better, but the world work better too. Our hungry and humble culture is stronger than ever, we can't thank our employees enough enough for their hard work and dedication. And with that, I'll look it up for Q&A. Operator : If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press [Operator instructions]. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Management asks that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Your first question will come from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much, Bill and Gina. Outstanding quarter. Bill, I wanted to just get your high-level thoughts coming as we did after a spectacular quarter and listening to campus [Indiscernible] on this call yesterday, we talked about tech as a percentage of global GDP going from 5 to 10%. I think I've said that before, which leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that tech density -- enterprise tech density is just going higher. It's not the world from 10 years back. We are a couple of ERP terms and that's it. Now it's thousands and thousands of SaaS applications in the [Indiscernible].  Where does that leads ServiceNow in terms of business prospects for spreading horizontally, vertically with your ITOM, ITSM, and the Workflow Engine, obviously, given that enterprise take density is just set to go from higher to even higher levels. And once again, Gina, when we look at this, this year has been fascinating. Net new businesses been accelerating for a few quarters. I know that you're not giving us thoughts on '22 yet, but how do you feel qualitatively stepping into 2022 with the renewal base that looks very solid, your net new business trends are getting better? Curious to get your thoughts. Thank you so much. Bill Mc Dermott : Well, Kash. Thank you very much for your kind remarks. You called the progress of our share price early on in the year, congratulations to you, you had it nailed. A couple of things, Kash. If you look at the geographies around the world, every single geography not only beat expectations, but they actually beat our internal plan handily. So every geography is expanding with ServiceNow at a record [Indiscernible]. If you look at our expansion in industry, we saw growth across all of our industry categories this quarter, it's amazing. Industries that were COVID impacted like transportation, logistics, business services, telecom, media, technology, financial services, government education, every single one of them was unbelievable success story this quarter.  And we have expanded dramatically in manufacturing, healthcare, life sciences, telecommunications, and banking. just to name a few. So think GEO, think industry, also think persona. This employee workflow business of ours is unstoppable because the employee experience is unstoppable, especially in a labor market that requires talent. And as you pointed out [Indiscernible] remarks are absolutely right. The GDP growth in tech is inescapable because it's the only way out, in a hybrid world to manage a competitive Company especially when you're competing for talent and you have to give them a great experience. Example, on-boarding experience, connecting all of their training tools, really making them a part of the culture when they might not even be in your buildings. Customer workflows, we announced a partnership with Twilio. Dealing with what's app and various messaging techniques, because all the old school ways are going away quickly. So with our CSM, our employee workflows, the experiences we're giving to people, is just unreal. And don't forget the creator workflows. 500 million net new applications will be developed in the next 2 plus years. And that will be developed for companies, by companies in their own technology departments and there's not enough engineers to do that in the world.  So the Now Platform is a growth sensation. All of these forces are coming together at once. And that is why I could not be more confident in the bullish stance on ServiceNow, not just in the short term, we run our business with clear messaging, clear facts. We could see the pipeline way into 2022 and some cases beyond. It is a fantastic situation right now, Kash. And Kash on your question with respect to the '22. Obviously, it's a bit early to talk guidance, but you are 100% correct. Our renewal base is very strong. We've seen very strong net new ACV acceleration throughout the year, as I've been talking about. And so we feel really bullish on the opportunities ahead of us in '22. The one thing that I would note is that FX has turned against us a little bit as we head into '22. And so I'm sure you would have all seen especially with respect to the euro, the dollar increasing. And so we have a bit of a headwind on FX as we look into '22. But feel really good about the underlying health of the business, our renewal of our net new ACV. And so we're poised to have a strong 2022. Very gratifying, brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you, [Indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Karl Keirstead : Well, thank you. Hi, Gina. 3 months ago on the 2Q call, you prepped us in terms of the back-half seasonality into thinking 3Q would be a little bit sub-seasonal, 4Q stronger as you were seeing that deal skew. In fact, you put up numbers where the 3Q actual and the 4Q billings guide of 26% are roughly even. So I'm just curious whether since you made that call, that seasonality 3Q, 4Q has changed and whether it played out in the way that you expected. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. Listen, I think we are really proud of the Q3 beat that we saw. Bill talked about all GEOS operating on all cylinders. And that's across the geographies, across all of the product portfolios. And so we were really pleased with the beat that we saw in Q3. We absolutely continue to see more business back-half-weighted to Q4. That is going to be a trend that we continue to see.  When you look at our Q4 results and our Q4 guide, you have to remember last year Q4. We had that 80 million of early payment that were brought forward, that really drove a higher growth number in Q4. And if you normalize that -- it's why I called out pretty transparently in the script. If you normalized for that, we're seeing 32% growth in Q4 billing. And so a really strong guide given our scale and our base. Karl Keirstead : Got it. That's clear. Thanks, Gina. Gina Mastantuono : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Bill, could you just talk a little bit about the Federal business this quarter in terms of the opportunities for that. Going into the fourth quarter, maybe next year. And then Gina, just one follow-up to Karl's question on the fourth-quarter guide. I realize that seasonalities gain more compounded, there's a lot of co-term activity that goes on around the fourth quarter.  I guess people are wondering why maybe the guidance wasn't upsized a little bit, relative to where it was implied going into it. So I was just kind of curious. I realize there's a lot of permutations that go under the fourth quarter just given the size of it. But was there anything else that maybe is making it be a little bit more conservative just in terms of visibility into add-on deals and things like that. Thanks. Bill Mc Dermott : Kirk, thank you very much for your question. We had a very, very strong federal quarter. 15 deals over a million, 14 federal agencies are now paying us more than 10 million. Key strategic wins included the IRS, which I talked about already, but it's certainly not limited to that. It's pretty amazing how the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing the services digitally to the citizens, which is incredible because as you know, that's all about the user experience and it's a workflow challenge. For example, look at how difficult it was for the government to get money out to small businesses during COVID.  There also were some big opportunities with new initiatives in the administration including resiliency, our business continuity, outages, terrorism, COVID, cyber security on top of many lists. The White House actually put out an executive order on improving the nation's cyber security after recent ransom attacks. So that's all workflow related leveraging existing systems that don't talk to each other very well. You certainly not going to rip and replace them, so that's where the Now platform comes in. And then just think about vaccine management, it remains one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces.  And boosters now will likely need to be re-administered on a regular basis. This again is a workflow challenge to distribute, administer, and monitor vaccines. We're in the mix on all of that. And what we're seeing is the connection of federal, state, and cities. They're all implementing the Now platform to engage with citizens. They're using products like Customer Service Management to help digitize these workflows that can no longer be processed in person, because the offices are still closed during the pandemic.  So overall, take this as a strong, aggressive, bullish, confident reply that the public sector is embracing the Now platform as its transformational opportunity at federal, state, local, university, and all public entities that are quickly embracing us. Because our Net Promoter Score is so high and we're a mouse that's saying this is the way to go, go now. Gina Mastantuono : And Tamar on your follow-up question with respect to Q4. And so I talked a bit about the normalized billings. So that's 32% for Q4. We actually have a 50 basis points FX headwind in Q4 of this year versus we had 150 basis points tailwind in Q3. So we really are moving in the right direction. What I would also call out is last year Q4, saw a tremendous growth, even when you normalize for those 80 million in collection.  And so we are basically at 32% growth in Q4, this year is normalized, on top of a 32% growth last year. So strong growth upon strong growth, I will say also that not only did we raise the guide for Q4 by our Q3 B, but we increased it by another 13 million in billings. We are seeing headwinds in Q4 for FX, but excluding that constant currency, constant duration growth is really strong. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question here. I wanted to ask about the Celonis partnership. It seems interesting; natural interplay with some of the AI features in the enterprise editions. Where do you see that partnership providing the biggest boost when you look across the stack at ServiceNow? Bill Mc Dermott : Yeah. Brad, thank you very much. The quick answer is the creator workflow platform. But what you're seeing out there is many businesses really have not maximized the value of their digital investments because they lack insight into the inefficiency of their processes. And that's what's holding back their business operations. So if you want to move the needle, organizations are going to need to understand how work is done across people, processes, and systems. So what's happening here is ServiceNow and Celonis that help customer map those elements in real-time, and then build digital workflows to more efficiently automated work. So we're going to create a seamless product experience for customers that's going to make it easy and simple for them to get insight into their processes across multiple enterprise systems. You'll be able to use Celonis 's EMS platform, and convert that insight, the x-ray, into action, automation, and remediation on the ServiceNow workflow platform. So think about brand to get the process mining, automation machine learning, RPA, and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience that customers will be enabled to quickly and continuously improve the flow of work.  So, shorter answer is the creative workflow platform, but what's happening is Celonis gets the x-ray, especially in the non ServiceNow environments. And then we use all the power of the Now platform, including process mining in the ServiceNow environment to give them a fast automation platform to make that business process home and really drive business outcome. I think this one is going to be really exciting and I thank my good partners, Alex and Bastian and Martin. I know our engineers are very committed to each other and we were going to nail it. Brad Sills : That's great to hear. Thanks so much, Bill one more if I may, just on that same topic there with creator, the progress you're seeing this quarter 18 into the top 20 deals. Are there any patterns you're seeing emerge in terms of common applications that are perhaps repeatable through the SI channel or just any color on where you are seeing traction there on the application side? Thank you so much. Bill Mc Dermott : Yeah. It's amazing. We literally had a review of this business just yesterday, and our outstanding leader just took us through it. And what you're basically saying is, the Now platform is integrated with all systems of record. So customers can build applications fast. And we really are the platform of all the other platforms. I've been seeing platform or platforms for a long time. And I want to make it clear we respect all those other platforms, all those other excellent brands. Our job is to make all of them even better by moving into the action layer or the hyper-automation layer on the Now platform.  And a trend we're seeing is, the younger generation of workers, they're not going to submit tickets. They want action. So enterprises are creating these centers of excellence, and they're letting students and developers build the solution to solve for the business challenges. I believe that hyper-automation is a key differentiator,, and because we have this 1 platform that does it all, RPA low-code process mining all on a single platform, and now with Celonis we get process mining in the non-service now environments, we bring everything together so customers can completely rethink their business model.  Example I gave in the script is Stanley Blacker their base -- Stanley Black & Decker. They're combining their new manufacturing vertical solution with the App Engine to build over 70 custom applications. This is all being done on the now low-code application platform. And our Fujitsu also is an example where they using App Engine to drive digital transformation and sustainability across the Company, moving the green line, not just the top and bottom line. Brad Sills : That's great to hear, Bill. Thanks so much. Bill Mc Dermott : Thank you very much for the question. Appreciate it, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from Tamar Samana (ph) from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Tamar Samana : Hi, good evening to exchange my questions. Congratulations on the great quarter. Bill, maybe one for you. You've talked about hiring and continuing to sustain growth. I noticed as I look at hiring in your professional services department, you've already added more people in 2021 than you did, I think, in the last 2 years combined. I'm just curious, should we see that as a leading indicator of projects that are firing up or service not taking a more active role in helping their own customers implement new deals? How should we think about that? Bill Mc Dermott : You should think of ServiceNow as a growth Company. As a Company that is firing on all cylinders and as a Company that is attracting the best talent in the industry. And that's really a sustaining part of our success. I'll give you an example, you take somebody like Erica Volini, who joined from Deloitte, she had a fantastic career at Deloitte. And she wanted to come in and help us transform the service experience for our customers. We're collapsing the pre and post-sale conversation. Everything here is about business impact and we're rethinking the whole services model. That's why our customer satisfaction and our net promoter score, is soaring. Not just our retention, we're focused on the in-process measures.  That's why Jon Ziglar (ph) came to us after great career at Apple, Microsoft and sales force and said, he believes that the Now platform was the future of business. And what we have been able to do is, hire thousands of people, even in a pandemic. Because the Now platform enables us to create the seamless hiring on-boarding, immediately scaling people off to our culture and their training needs, and then managing them in a hybrid world in a way that gives them the experience of our culture, and the word gets out there quickly. We are literally harder to get into the Stanford statistically, even as you see thousands joining.  So we are not opportunity constrained, and that's what I've been saying the whole time. Why are we organically growing? Why are we committed to our engineering? Why are we fiercely committed to our market leadership? Because we can be, this is the plant of this generation and we're investing primarily in great engineers and go-to-market, especially quota-bearing, where we can deliver for our shareholders, our customers, and our partners. The other thing I want to underscore is we have really expanded the ecosystem. So as you even see us hiring thousands, just think the Ecosystem is hiring even more thousands on thousands, to get around this Now platform and get their piece of the action in GEOS, in industries and Personas, this is a growth story. Tamar Samana : Not only do we see as a growth story, but one of the best growth stories. Bill Mc Dermott : Thanks. Tamar Samana : Gina, just a quick follow-up for you if I can squeeze it in just -- as I think about some of the new customers signed in 4Q of last year, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market. Are you seeing those customers expand at a higher rate or maybe being easier to up sell as you get -- as you lap the cohorts. Maybe they were signed up late last year as new ads, just as we get more certainty and looks to be a stronger macro-environment. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah. We're really pleased with our new logos, both from Q4 of last year and throughout 2021. We're seeing strong growth even in Q3 with 6 new customers greater than a million dollars, and they're across industries, just in Q3 alone, that's banking, retail, manufacturing, and energy, just to name a few. We are absolutely seeing our deal sizes grow. New customers, average deal size grow quarter-on-quarter, and year-on-year. And we're seeing healthy growth abroad in EMEA and APJ as well. And so we're really focused on evolving our land to the right new customer. And IC continues to be a high percentage of those new logos. And we're seeing we are actually seeing a much higher percentage also, of land occurring with CSN, App Engine and HR, and so those cohorts are growing very well. Our expansion rate is doing very well, and just really firing on all cylinders across all 3 of our geographies. Tamar Samana : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thank you for taking the question. Gina, a question for you. Just trying to understand the very varying trajectories of what you're describing in terms of billings growth. It sounds like it's accelerating into Q4. And granted there's a lot of normalizations in here, I think that's right where the answer is. To get to that 32% normalized billings growth in Q4 versus the current RPO growth, which you guided to a pretty sharp deceleration. I think going for like 32% growth, that's 28.5 on a constant-currency basis. Are there any kind of factors that we should be aware of, in terms of adjustments or sort of changing contract dynamic that would cause that variance in the trajectories? Gina Mastantuono : It's a great question and so rightfully so, you took into account the FX is impacting our CPR -- C RPO. Most of the remaining CRPO growth as I already said, is actually due to seasonality within our renewal cohort. And so our typical customer contracts as far as you know, is around 36 months on average, and we have a large cohort coming up for renewal in 2022. So this is starting to flow out of Q4 of this year. Which because of one included the future renewals until they renew with pipeline sale.  And so that deceleration is really what's driving that -- it's the seasonality of the cohort that's driving that deceleration. And once that cohort renews in 2022 and with 98% renewal rates across-the-board, we feel really good and strong about our renewal base, that will have a stabilizing impact with the RPO growth into 2022. Keith Weiss : Got it. That makes a ton of sense. Thanks so much. Gina Mastantuono : Awesome. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thanks so much guys and congratulations again. Bill, maybe just the first one for you around your -- I know you beat this drum quite a bit for the first 3 quarters. But I want to ask it again. As we look to 2022, your approach towards -- and thinking about organic versus inorganic growth. Obviously, the organic growth and the profile of the Company has been second to none to date. How are you thinking about the road to 15 plus as you sit here today, within that construct? And I have a quick follow-up for Gina. Bill Mc Dermott : Alex, it's a great question. I could not be -- I could not possibly be more confident in our our ability to achieve the 15 billion plus on an organic basis by 2026, which is exactly what I said at the Investor Day. And I also underscore the fact that we recognize that our balance sheet is extremely strong and will be even stronger as we move into the future. And we continue to source, look at, consider all options that would benefit shareholder value creation without ever passing on any tech debt to customers as many others have done. So, just know that everything is always on the table, but at this time there are no substantial acquisitions on the table, not a single one. And we could not be more confident in our organic growth. In fact, that's where we're looking at our investments and we're prioritizing them because we're certainly not opportunity constrained, Alex. The Company is in fantastic shape. Alex Zukin : That's awesome. And Gina, maybe one for you. We've talked a lot about growth and confidence in growth both into Q4 and even beyond, I wanted to ask you a question about margins, some of your peers have talked about models coming out of the pandemic that are more efficient learnings that maybe not every salesperson has to get on a plane and there's more productivity to be had in a remote world and construct.  While others have talked about investing more aggressively for growth and doubling down and seeing some of the tailwinds from the pandemic savings potentially revert next year. Where does ServiceNow fit in from a margin conversation standpoint as we start to think about a more normalized environment, hopefully? Gina Mastantuono : Absolutely, it's a great question. Thank you so much, Alex. So, first of all, 100% I noticed that many of our learnings from working remotely will absolutely have lasting effect on our overall efficiency. But I've been pretty transparent throughout the year, that it does give us the ability and the agility to redeploy savings elsewhere. Like Bill just talked about organic growth. We are at an inflection point where we have no lack of opportunity and we are a first and foremost a growth Company and we will absolutely invest behind that. That being said, at our Financial Analysis Day in May, I talked about committing to 26.5% margin by 2024. We absolutely remain committed to that and on that trajectory, but I don't think that, that increase is going to be linear.  As we think about offices reopening, and travel becoming more consistent and in-person events happening more. We definitely don't believe that it's going to be a linear path to 26.5. I'm not actually in a position at this point to guide the 2022, but we are 100% committed to over that 3-year period, getting to 26.5. Because we absolutely believe that will have savings that will be able to pay from these learning and efficiencies from the pandemic and redeploy them on growth opportunities that we see absolutely in front of us today. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tyler Radke : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed the million-dollar customers were up pretty nicely year-over-year here in Q3. I was wondering kind of the drivers of that was there -- some one-offs and should we expect that type of strength in customer adds are heading into your seasonally strongest quarter. Bill Mc Dermott : Yes, you should expect it to continue, Tyler. The reality is we've become a platform Company. I came in a couple of years ago now, and we've really seen the transformation of the Company to full-scale enterprise software companies. And we took the strength that we had in IT and we have made it really our hallmark because it's very clear now in this world, as the world is dealing with digital transformation, everybody understands that the technology architecture is the business architecture.  And that has given us enormous responsibility, but also permission to expand the perimeter into the employee experience, into Customer Service Management, including direct-to-consumer, field service management. This create a workflow business which is just an absolute sensation ties together so many of these just disjointed processes systems and silos and enterprises today, and really puts together an enterprise software market leading approach from ServiceNow, so think of us as an enterprise player on a platform that is unstoppable. Tyler Radke : Great, and Bill, you mentioned earlier that transportation and logistics are particularly strong on net new ACV. And we're just curious on the angle of supply chain constraints that a lot of industries are facing. Are you finding that that's a catalyst for conversation around digitizing and creating more efficient workloads and just help us understand the balance of that versus potential challenges, closing deals, just given the supply chain constraints. Thanks. Bill Mc Dermott : Yeah, actually, it's a great question, Tyler, because I know in some industries they talk about the supply chain dilemma and boat off the port with a lot of things in them. But this is actually an opportunity for us, because what's happening now is companies have to reorient their business models. They have to think about their extended supply chain. They have to rewire who their partners are actually going to be, and who they're not going to be. How they're going to source things from different places in the world that they've never even worked with before. And this is all going to create the extended supply chain opportunity for the Now platform. You might have noticed, for example, we acquired Deep Brain, which is a small Company in Denmark because we are in so many different ERP related conversations where we're helping our great ERP friends instead of doing mass customization through consultants that would take years and years. With the Now Platform, you can do it in days. So this is creating a ground swell of opportunity on the ERP level, on the supply chain level, on the finance level, on the procurement level, it's just unbelievable. I mean, I've never seen an opportunity like this in my entire career. Tyler Radke : All right. Thank you. Bill Mc Dermott : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just one question from my side. Bill, I was just wondering if you can give us an update in terms of the experience you saw on the quarter around the customer service use case. And then separately when you look at the observability process or progress that you're making, if you can just give us an update on where you stand in moving into that market segment? Bill Mc Dermott : Yes. Thank you very much, Sterling. I really appreciate it. So let me start with Lightstep first of all because I want to give a big shout out to Ben and his great team. We love Ben. We love his team. And they're just going to be a sensation here. We're continually impressed by the depth of engineering talent at Lightstep and the?absobability? solution. We're still in the early innings of integrating the business as you know, but we've had strong up-sells from existing customers and we're seeing that as a testament to how they value Lightstep's product. And it's already delivering to organizations. It's currently being sold on a stand alone basis. But we expect that to be going to market solidly with ServiceNow, at an enterprise level in 2022.  We're also doing some product direct sales with the Light step product in the Internet channel. And I think that is also a potential elixir that markets may not be expecting from ServiceNow. It's a new play in the playbook and we're pretty excited about it. On CSM, I'm really excited about our leadership in CSM. We have a fantastic leader in CSM with industry renowned experience, and we're winning in verticals everywhere. Whether it's financial services, telecom, healthcare, and life sciences. It's pretty incredible. What you're seeing here, and I actually went through this business review yesterday as well, you're seeing CSM completely rethink direct-to-consumer. You're rethinking Customer Service Management.  And you're thinking about messaging, you're thinking about Whatsapp differently, you're thinking about Twilio and ServiceNow, embedding these really swift solutions for the customer experience. Think about field service management. Think about the connected experience for the ultimate consumer. Yes, other CRM companies have done a very good job on the engagement layer. Unfortunately, the customer experience doesn't end with the engagement layer. It begins with the engagement layer so the operations layer of the Company and the back office IT capability of the Company has to be tethered to that engagement layer, which is given us net new opportunities, including IoT opportunities with field service and fleets of products, fleets of trucks, fleets of cars, easy marketplaces that we've never seen the likes of.  And then you combine that with the creator workflow, where it's like, Hey, I can have it my way. You mean I can customize that? Yeah. And guess what? When you do the upgrade would ServiceNow, you don't have to get the consulting team into rethink the whole implementation, with us it's invisible. It's like driving a Tesla, you press a button the next day you have a new Tesla, that's what ServiceNow is doing, incredible innovation. Sterling Auty : That sounds good. Thank you. Bill Mc Dermott : You're most welcome. Thank you for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks. Congrats from me as well. Bill, you k now our new areas with [Indiscernible] and observability from the acquisitions a few months ago. What has been the customer feedback? and then since you announced the Loehmann's (ph) well, how do you draw the line between partnership where there was doing yourself and how is that playing out so far. Thank you. Bill Mc Dermott : Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Raimo. Again, as I said, ServiceNow's platform has process mining. We have RPA,we have machine learning, we have AI ops, we have all the predictive technologies based on the moves we made as you know, built in. But there are non-ServiceNow environments, especially if you think about large scale ERP environment, that's just 1 example where our business processes are fragmented, there are multiple instances of multiple participants, and the customer really needs an X-ray.  What's going on around here? And we combine that knowledge of all the non - ServiceNow environments that require process mining x-ray with what we do ourselves to get a forced multiplier effect. And as a result, so long as it's there, there's no doubt, the gold standard for workflow automation in the enterprise is ServiceNow. Why would we want to spend our time building the gold standard? We partner with you. We move into the x-ray into the action layer and together we offer the customer something they never got before - a great x-ray and an unbelievable immediate value to action process on the Now Platform. And I really think this is a perfect example of trust being the ultimate human currency.  I would've never done the partnership with Alex and Bastian, and Martin and their terrific team. I might add in Munich, Germany, one of my great friends. In the world, I know it's how much I love Germany as the second home. So it's really fun to work with them. They all went to the Technical University of Munich, by the way, we have great relationships. And just think about all the customers in Germany, that are going to hear this news, they are going to be like, wow, I'm trying to modernize my architecture. Can you give me an x-ray and then you can move all the innovation onto an action layer and then I can start to drive business outcomes in days, weeks and months, as opposed to multiple years, I think I signed now, Raimo Lenschow : Super, thank you. Bill Mc Dermott : Thank you very much Raimo. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Congratulations from me as well, guys. I guess, be -- whether it could be for either Bill or Gina. You mentioned, there -- I guess it was an early question from Alex on the future of work. I'm curious, what is ServiceNow's philosophy on the future of work? And I guess -- Bill I'm wondering, as reps -- sales reps get out on the road and there's more in-person conferences, industry conferences. And -- do you suspect that that could help improve pipelines even further than more of a remote selling process? Bill Mc Dermott : Yeah, Matt, there's no doubt, it's all upside. Because what you're seeing now is a purely digital motion to the marketplace. The great news is CEOs, management teams, and leaders of all kinds and companies, both in the public, and the private sector, have accepted this new way of communication. Which I believe has expedited collaboration, and has expedited decision-making because you don't have the clunkyness and the clumsiness of the heavy travel to get something done in a few minutes as opposed to a few weeks, especially in a global Company, is a blessing.  However, there is nothing that will ever replace humans being in the same room, ideating, collaborating, dreaming, thinking about the next frontier. And that's why it's all upside for us, because we're going to combine everything we're doing now in the playbook with the direct motions. And we're going to leverage the hybrid world both for ourselves, our customers, and our partners. So I actually think the tailwind going into an economy that's opening up is probably underestimated by everybody on the call today. Matt Hedberg : Great, super-helpful looking forward to that as we as we look in 2022, congrats, guys. Bill Mc Dermott : Thank you very much, Matt. Operator : And we have time for one last question. It will come from Arjun Bhatia, from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Arjun Bhatia : Perfect. Thank you. And I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Bill, in your prepared remarks, you talked about Companies consolidating, your customers consolidating legacy systems on ServiceNow, I'm curious whether you're starting to get to the point where within the systems that you're replacing, we're starting to see some maybe more modern SaaS applications that are being removed and folded into the Now deployment as well? Or are we still at the space where there's still so much work to be done on legacy, on prem systems or you're not seeing those modern applications fold into your platform? Bill Mc Dermott : Yeah. I -- it's a really good question Arjun what I'm saying is there's still a massive set of customers out there with legacy. And what you're also seeing and Gina as an example, is our internal champion on ESG. We're sure beautifully with the engineering team when we announced one of the greatest ESG in a box solutions in the world. Actually I think it's the only one in the world. But what's amazing is there's all these islands of automation. Everybody is doing something good that's a modern system or a modern product or a modern tool that's fine. But it doesn't necessarily unify on a common architecture where there is security, there is enterprise coherence.  There is business operations, there is one end-to-end process that includes all the people, all the processes, and all the technology, and that's where the Now Platform comes in. And is especially true, in the world of 20th century architectures, because even if you move them to a Cloud, just think about the costs, the time, the risk, and the companies that are dealing with do or die moments today, they just don't want to wait. So to have an action platform that can absolutely simulate the perfect enterprise at record speed, and I might add with a gorgeous consumer grade UX, is a sensational business case. And that's why you're seeing the deals get bigger.  You've seen us go into a platform Company model and you now see that service now is their clear sensation? It's because we're giving the customer what they want, and what I also learned -- and I think it's an important attribute of our engineering culture and our great engineering leader and all of his leaders on -- we always say here at ServiceNow that our strategy is informed by our customers strategy and deeply understanding their issues and their opportunities. And we're so quick to be able to innovate and get new releases out to market at excellent quality. And then even the ones that we didn't get out in the release can be handled by the creator workflow platform. We also build something inside of ServiceNow called NowX, where we have a series of on deck organic innovations that are going to hit the market and take it by storm. I had an earlier question on supply chain. That's one of the major areas where we're focused on. So, there's such an opportunity with legacy there's still such an opportunity to unify these enterprises on common platforms. There's such an opportunity for hyper automations, to automate what people thought they already automated. That I just can't see any constraint to the growth agenda of ServiceNow. Arjun Bhatia : Perfect. Thank you very much. Bill Mc Dermott : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : We are out of time for questions today. This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good bye.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Darren Yip, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Darren Yip : Good afternoon and thank you for joining ServiceNow's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2021 results and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our information discussed on this call such as guidance is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 2021 10-K that will be filed or factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We'd like to also point out that we have presented non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, and current RPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Darren, and a warm welcome to everybody joining us on today's call. ServiceNow has once again delivered results that significantly beat the high end of expectations. Here's the Q4 rundown in constant currency. Subscription revenue growth was 30%. CRPO growth was 32%. Free cash flow growth was 32%. Adjusted subscription billings growth was an exceptional 33%. Operating margin was 23%, one point over our guidance. We had a record 135 deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. There has long been a Rule of 40 benchmark for highly successful software companies. These results demonstrate that ServiceNow operates beyond the Rule of 60. The company is expanding in all geographies, industries and buyer personas. Gina will share the details in a few moments, including our strong 2022 guidance. ServiceNow is uniquely positioned. We're growing like a fast-moving start-up with the profitability of a global market leader. We're on a clear growth trajectory to $15 billion plus by 2026. While our strong cash position preserves optionality, we don't depend on M&A for growth. While rising interest rates challenge others, ServiceNow's business model is built to flourish in any economic environment. We are not opportunity constrained as our customers' need for digital transformation is ever expanding. Our organic growth machine is in full flight, and our pipeline is stronger than ever. Our 99% renewal rate is one of several lead indicators for sustained performance moving forward. I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders, especially our customers for their steadfast confidence in ServiceNow. I'll give you the breakdown of our portfolio results, but first, let's discuss the market dynamics. We're in a sustained demand environment here. There are structural challenges facing every industry in every geographic region. The great resignation, supply chain disruption, inflation, to name a few. These underscore a point we have made consistently, the technology strategy has become the business strategy. Digital technologies are growth-stimulating deflationary force. They power new business models, accelerating productivity while reducing costs. 85% of chief executives will sustain or increase technology budgets this year, and that's according to IDC's global CEO survey. IDC has increased their forecast for digital transformation, now a $10.7 trillion opportunity through 2025. Gartner forecasts worldwide software spending will increase 12% in 2022. The data shows this is clearly more than a pandemic-induced transformation. A CEO I spoke to last week said it perfectly. \u201cI have a long list of strategic priorities. Technology isn't one of them, it runs through all of them.\u201d ServiceNow's Q4 results clearly validate the structural incline of this digital economy. As enterprises build, deploy, monitor and service technology, our IT workflow business is at the core. IT service management was in 16 of our top 20 Q4 deals, with 19 deals over $1 million. IT operations management was in 18 of our top 20, with 21 deals over $1 million. Bell Canada, Canada's largest telco company, uses IT workflows and IT operations management to enable its operations. Our platform will improve critical dimensions of both asset management and the employee experience. ServiceNow will also be supporting the United States space force to connect its space operators with warfighters across the globe. The hyper focus on hybrid work continues to propel our employee workflows business. HR service delivery was in 11 of our top 20 deals, with an exciting 24 deals over $1 million. Johnson Controls International, a smart building solutions leader, will use employee workflows to unlock productivity for its 105,000 employees. Together with ServiceNow, they are focused on creating a human-centered approach to the employee experience. NVIDIA is using employee workflows to support its employee experience transformation. With ServiceNow, NVIDIA will provide its global employees a unified service model to support its mission by providing a frictionless employee experience. CVS Health will also leverage our technology and employee workflows to help deliver a best-in-class colleague experience. As business integration is key to customer service, our customer workflows business is thriving. Customer service management was in 13 of our top 20 deals, with 10 deals over $1 million. Google Cloud plans to use our customer workflows to enhance its customer support operations. British Telecom chose ServiceNow to address the needs of its next generation of customers. The ServiceNow platform will help BT accelerate the delivery of new services from 36 weeks to three. Our new industry vertical solutions also continue to gain traction with wins at major brands, including SaaS Institute, Deutsche Telekom and Wellstar. Technology teams alone can\u2019t build the 500 million new applications IDC forecasts by 2023. Our creative workflows business is leading the citizen developer revolution. Our platform solutions were in 19 of our top 20 deals. Lockheed Martin, the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense company, is using ServiceNow to support its enterprise digital transformation. They will use our creative workflows to help automate processes globally. Petrobras, a Brazilian energy company, is using creative workflows as the foundation for its application development function. They have already built over 26 applications such as onboarding for oil platforms and managing data privacy regulations. Together, these businesses, IT, customer, employee, creator, represent a next-generation suite built on a pure-play born in the cloud architecture. Our intuitive consumer-grade experience is expanding adoption of this platform everywhere, already 70 million users strong. This has created a unique moat in terms of ServiceNow\u2019s strategic relevance in the enterprise. From a geographic perspective, we\u2019ve continued to see momentum worldwide. This includes APJ with wins at Samsung SDS in South Korea and NEC in Japan. In EMEA, we\u2019re partnering with the French Postal Service, La Poste, and leading Italian energy company, NL. As you can see, the digital opportunity is expanding dramatically for ServiceNow. Already, in 2022, we\u2019re taking significant steps on our long-term roadmap. We\u2019re introducing a state-of-the-art new solution, ServiceNow Impact. Leaders need a command center to navigate the fully connected world. ServiceNow Impact includes an intuitive consumer-grade mobile application that visualizes the value from transformation investments in real time on their device. As this experience speeds up user adoption, we anticipate a significant halo effect with broader consumption of our growing solutions portfolio. As our market opportunities expand, we are promoting strong leaders for scale. As a result of the consistent speed and unmatched quality of our innovation teams, we are expanding CJ Desai\u2019s role to Chief Operating Officer of the company. He will continue to lead products and engineering while also assuming industry and solution responsibilities for the company. Our top sales leader, Kevin Haverty, has executed at an art form level for more than 10 years at ServiceNow. Kevin will also step into a strategic role for the company, serving as a mentor for the next-generation of ServiceNow leaders. He will work directly with me on expanding our footprint in the public sector worldwide. Paul Smith will become Chief Commercial Officer, assuming our global sales responsibility. As ServiceNow\u2019s President of Europe, Middle East and Africa, Paul has established himself as a leader of consequence who can broaden the geographic reach of ServiceNow. All regions in the company have outstanding leadership in place, and I\u2019m very, very proud of the work they are doing indeed. We\u2019re also recruiting outstanding new leaders to the company. Karen Pavlin has joined ServiceNow to become Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Karen joins from our great partner, Accenture, where she led this function. She will help us embed diverse strategies directly into our business strategy because inclusive companies outperform all the others. While our leadership team continues to strengthen, our inspired global workforce remains ever loyal. Look at our retention rate. ServiceNow is not only recruiting great talent, we keep it. In the engineering function as an example, we see much lower attrition rates than any of our peer group benchmarks. While no company is immune from the war on talent, our unique culture puts us in a highly differentiated position. Our high rankings from Glassdoor show that our people are invested in ServiceNow\u2019s bright future. We see growth everywhere for ServiceNow. Our customers now view us as the standard platform for digital transformation. Our engineers continue to strengthen this highly innovative, scalable platform architecture. Our customer success teams have navigated the COVID challenges without missing a beat. Our partner ecosystem continues to build ServiceNow practices with even bigger commitments for long-term growth. The market forces are moving even more intensely in our direction. For the future of work, businesses need to integrate disparate systems. Leaders are more invested in ESG than ever. There are 2 common thirds here. First, ServiceNow\u2019s platform is purpose-built for each opportunity. Our new integrated ESG-in-a-box offering is a perfect example. Second, every company wants to become an exponential business. They cannot do that with linear processes. Of the 20 most valuable companies 30 years ago, zero are in the top 20 today. The question is then, which companies will be on that list 10 years from now? To be in that conversation, leaders need outcomes really fast. ServiceNow gives them the speed advantage they\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re empowering digital-first leaders to accelerate their vision. Our purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. Our ambition is to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. ServiceNow\u2019s 2021 results and strong 2022 guidance signal our unshakable confidence in that goal. Our performance should leave no doubt, we are executing on all cylinders, and we will continue to do so. The world is looking for market leaders to build a new inclusive, sustainable wave of economic value, and ServiceNow is delivering. This is why we embrace the brand, the motto and the maxim. The world works with ServiceNow. Thank you for your time. I look forward to your questions. Now over to our great CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill, and Happy New Year to everyone listening in. Q4 was a fantastic quarter, capping an already phenomenal 2021. Despite increased FX headwind, ServiceNow outperformed across all of our top line guidance metrics in Q4. Our performance over the past couple of years not only exemplifies our unwavering focus on delivering customer success, but is a testament to the innovation and flexibility that Now Platform provides to our customers. Whatever the macro challenges were, ServiceNow adapted to deliver value. ServiceNow\u2019s ability to quickly respond to the needs of enterprises when and where they require us most is why we\u2019ve become the trusted digital platform to drive transformation. It\u2019s why our renewal rates are best-in-class, creating a solid foundation from which we grow upon each year. It\u2019s why in 2021, we added more incremental subscription revenues than we reported in 2016. I want to pause there for that to sink in. In 2021, we added a whole other 2016 ServiceNow to the top line, incredible organic growth at scale, while generating over 30% free cash flow margin. Now turning to our Q4 results. Subscription revenues were $1.523 billion, growing 30% year-over-year in constant currency. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $3 million when adjusting for the incremental $15 million FX headwind we saw in the quarter we beat by $18 million. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.7 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth and a nearly four point beat versus our FX-adjusted guidance. Q4 subscription billings were $2.420 billion, a $110 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. This represents 32% year-over-year growth on a reported basis and 33% year-over-year growth on an adjusted basis as FX and duration were a headwind of 100 basis points. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities more than doubled its net new ACV contribution from the year ago period. Business services and health care and life sciences also had a robust Q4, with very high double-digit net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 99%, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers\u2019 operations. These enterprises not only remain loyal ServiceNow customers, but our customer cohorts have continued to show solid expansion over time. As of the end of Q4, we had over 1,350 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. Our strategy of targeting the right enterprise customers that drive the best ROI and can grow with us over time is bearing fruit. In Q4, we closed 135 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up over 50% year-over-year. In addition, our Better Together story is resonating as 18 of our top 20 deals included five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 23%, one point above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. Our free cash flow margin in the quarter was 46%. For full year 2021, operating margin was 25% and free cash flow margin was 32%, representing $1.9 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $4.9 billion in cash and investments, putting us in excellent shape to continue investing in strategic initiatives to drive organic growth. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re achieving all of this with a focus on ESG and winning the right way. Last quarter, I announced our commitment to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, two decades earlier than our previous goal. This quarter, you heard Bill introduce Karen Pavlin, who will lead our efforts to strengthen our culture, ensuring equity and creating an even deeper sense of belonging. Diversity, equity, inclusion are business imperatives for ServiceNow. And in 2021, we outperformed all six of our representation and hiring goals across three categories : Black, Hispanic and Latinx and Women in leadership. At its core, ServiceNow\u2019s culture is one of belonging. It is core to who we are, and it will be one of the keys to our company\u2019s growth for many years to come. Moving on to guidance. Since the end of Q3, we\u2019ve seen an incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar, resulting in a material FX headwind in 2022. To help provide investors better visibility into the underlying strength of the business, I\u2019ll be providing constant currency guidance. I would also note that in January, we completed an assessment of the useful life of our data center equipment and determined that we could extend their estimated life from three to four years. As a result, we expect a reduction in depreciation expense, which will contribute approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in 2022, trending down to just 50 basis points in 2024. With that in mind, I\u2019ll turn to our 2022 outlook. Last year was a strong year, and I\u2019m excited to announce that our momentum will carry into 2022 as we do not expect any change in constant currency growth year-over-year. We expect subscription revenues between $7.02 billion and $7.04 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. That\u2019s 28% on a constant currency basis, the same growth as 2021. It\u2019s an amazing achievement when you think about the fact that the base we are growing off of is $1.3 billion higher when we started just last year. We expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We expect an operating margin of 25%. With regard to operating expenses, we have reopened many offices and are planning in-person conferences and user events this year. Our sales force has also already begun to travel again. As such, we expect certain COVID-related savings we\u2019ve seen over the past two years to stay in 2022. We expect free cash flow margins of 31%, and we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 204 million. For Q1, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We expect subscription revenues between $1.61 billion and $1.615 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth or 27.5% constant currency growth. We expect cRPO growth of 28% year-over-year or 29.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 25%, and we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, we had a very strong Q4, and I\u2019m so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. Demand in 2022 continues to be strong. Enterprises are turning to ServiceNow to create new business models to address the new ways employees and customers want to engage. The Now Platform offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. We\u2019re well on our way to $15 billion and beyond and becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Before moving on to Q&A, Bill and I want to thank our employees around the world for a tremendous year. You are the key to ServiceNow success, and you all continue to make us, ServiceNow, strong. And with that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Phil Winslow : Hi, team. Thank you taking my question and congratulations on a strong end to a really strong full year. Investors have been concerned this year about a potential pull forward in demand really setting the stage for a decelerating growth across software. Now looking at your results tonight and the guidance, I really can\u2019t find any signs of decelerating demand for ServiceNow. In fact, sales and marketing headcount in Q4 grew at its fastest rate since Q1 2020, which suggests you\u2019re continuing to lean in here. So two questions. First, Bill, my question to you is, what are you hearing from customers that gives you confidence in the sustainability of growth and to accelerate this go-to-market hiring exiting the year? And Gina, what trends are you seeing in terms of ramping these new sales and marketing hires. Thanks. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Phil, for your kind remarks and also for your question. Customers are absolutely focused on technology being the business strategy. And digital transformation is in full flight, and we will capitalize on that greatly. The reality on our numbers is we did not see any evidence of unusual demand pull forward into our business for 2021. It happened in an extremely linear and coherent fashion, which was really a thing of beauty to watch from an execution perspective. And as I look at the pipelines, they\u2019re ever increasing, and they\u2019re doing that across the platform, the employee experience, the customer experience, the creator experience. And all of this now is really making ServiceNow one of those real standard platforms for well-run companies in the 21st century. And I think that includes a very short list of others. We\u2019re one of them. And Phil, the business just couldn\u2019t be going better. Gina Mastantuono : And then, Phil, on your question with respect to ramp rep, you\u2019re absolutely right, we did not pause at all on our headcount growth in Q4. We\u2019re entering 2022 with more ramped sales reps than we entered 2021, and we feel really good about pipeline and the demand that we see in front of us. So we are absolutely not stopping our investment in go-to-market resources. We are planning for a very strong 2022. Phil Winslow : Awesome. Thanks team. Congratulations again. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Phil. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Phil. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Congrats from me as well. Well done. The \u2013 can we talk a little bit about the revenue or you\u2019re achieving with one of your biggest clients you have like a record number now or people over $1 million in ACV. But the ACV number is also going up, like \u2013 Bill, can you talk a little bit about how you see this trending going forward with all the different products that you have, but also the product expansion that you\u2019re seeing there? How do you think this will evolve over time? Thank you. Bill McDermott : Raimo, excellent question. This is really a beautiful point in the scale phase that ServiceNow is in. And you might notice the substantial promotion for CJ in addition to taking on his normal great results for development and engineering. He\u2019s now moving into the industry phase where we\u2019re going to connect the code to the actual industry-specific solutions the specialist professionals that guide our general line sales force and our customer relationships each and every day. And that\u2019s going to give us a real special bilateral communication with our customers to innovate at an even faster clip than we have in the past, if that\u2019s possible. And you see what happens in telecommunications, in financial services. You see what happens in government, health care, life sciences. All the businesses that we\u2019ve chosen to focus on from an industry perspective are really scaling and doing so very, very quickly. And here\u2019s where the big deals have only just begun. If you look at businesses today, and there\u2019s one retailer in particular that I referenced in the call like CBS, which is a great company, they have retail customers, but they\u2019re also transforming into a health and wellness company, and they understand the experience that they have to give their customers is evolving into a multi-workflow environment. So on one hand, I have to keep my associates super happy because they have complex enough jobs. I have to keep my customers happy because, in some cases, they want to come to the store. In other cases, they want the store to come to them. I\u2019m transforming my business model between all of these factors, and now I\u2019m going for health and wellness. And someday, I\u2019ll not only do that in store, but I can do that at the home. So you\u2019re seeing multi-complex workflows possible on the Now Platform coming together to form greater-sized solutions that have major business impact for our customers and the value we can create with digital transformation. So the challenge I\u2019ve got out to the company, Raimo, is the large deals will accelerate dramatically on a year-over-year basis. We are now prepared for that, and we have the best leaders in the positions in the company to deliver that, and we have an extremely inspired workforce and an extremely inspired ecosystem. So all that comes together. And as you know, I\u2019ve seen the movie before. When it all comes together, it equals big growth. Raimo Lenschow : Sounds very exciting. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Congrats on a great end to the year. Bill, maybe the first one for you. If you think about what you just said to Raimo\u2019s question about being in a great position to massively accelerate the amount of large deals, is it right to kind of think that industry clouds and the low-code platform vision, that\u2019s the big motion that you think will unlock the most value in some of these larger deals, even more \u2013 maybe even more so than HR, CSM? Or what\u2019s the right way to think about like the growth drivers of these expansion opportunities over the course of the next year? And look, it doesn\u2019t escape all of us the valuation contraction we\u2019ve seen in the public markets. Does it change or in any way influence your strategy or thought process around organic versus inorganic growth? Bill McDermott : Yes. Alex, that\u2019s a really significant set of issues, and I\u2019ll address them head on. First of all, every great company has a great core business. Because when you have a multibillion core business, that core business has to perform, so you get the leverage on all the adjacencies. Our core business is better than ever, and it\u2019s growing really strong. In fact, I think it could be very close to the overall corporate growth rate as we look into the crystal ball. Then you add on employee experience. You have to remember, this employee experience and the future of work and where people are going to be working and how they\u2019re going to be working, especially exacerbated by a talent war out there, is really a big deal. And CEOs need to retain the people they have now. They better be recruiting and onboarding in a flawless manner because the employees today expect consumer-grade user experiences in the enterprise. And if they don\u2019t get them, they even don\u2019t come on in the first place because they know what\u2019s going on in these companies. The Internet tells them that. Or when they get there, they don\u2019t stay very long because they\u2019re not happy. So the employee experience is front and center. And then on customer service management, the reality is this is just starting because the world is really acknowledged that the customer is not going to come to you the way they used to. You\u2019re going to have to go to them, and you\u2019re going to have to explain to that customer that your brand gets it and you can give them an experience no matter where they\u2019re experience in your brand that has enormous consistency, service value, and yes, even helpful hands in terms of smart transactions through an AI platform like ServiceNow. And then you take the creative workflow. Look, 500 million applications between now and the end of 2023 is more applications that have been built in the last 40 years. So there\u2019s no choice. It\u2019s going to be low code, no code, and the ServiceNow platform is beautifully positioned. Now let me extend to your question on industry and low code. That is absolutely a very astute observation because if you take the low-code revolution and you combine it with industry, we\u2019re now solving business problems that have been out there for a long time. We featured the Celonis partnership where they could do the X-ray and the non-ServiceNow installed environments. We can activate all the changes that are necessary to augment the business process on the now action layer. And of course, here\u2019s the big thing, all those systems out there have been mass customized. But with ServiceNow, you can carry forward all your customizations with the creative workflow. You don\u2019t need a team of consultants in a truck coming over there for years and years projects and billions and billions. This is speed to market. This is low-cost rollout of big ideas and business model innovations and better service for the employee and the customer. So it all comes together. And the reason I\u2019m so excited about what we\u2019re doing with the executive team here is we\u2019re all lined up now to take everything we know how to do and scale it across the world in every geo, in every industry and every persona. And I have to thank my partners out there. I mean they\u2019re knocking down the door to get a bigger piece of the ServiceNow franchise. So it\u2019s all of those things coming together, Alex. Now on M&A, I want to be really super clear about this. We have no targets on the Board for M&A. And the reason for that it is on an organic growth basis. You see the numbers as much as I see the numbers. The cloud economics are in full flight. And we have engineers that love this company, and they love coming to work every day, whether they\u2019re working out of their home or our office, we\u2019re all open. And they come in and they create new things and they have an idea that they can take and they have a dream that they can build. When I listen to other engineers and other software companies that want to come over here tell me they spend 90% of their time integrating the past as opposed to innovating the future, it just reminds me of how thoughtful we have to be on M&A. So as Gina said, we have $5 billion in cash. That\u2019s going to continue to grow exponentially you know that. We\u2019re fueling our organic growth ambitions. We can be opportunistic. But in this guide and this current state of affairs, there is no intent to do any large-scale M&A. And if that were to change, I would be the first to tell you. Alex Zukin : Incredibly specific, and we all love the candor and appreciate that color. I guess maybe just a quick follow-up. First of all, congratulations to CJ. What a wonderful expansion of his abilities and opportunities. I wanted to ask about the shift on the Chief Customer Officer. What plays \u2013 Workday as an example, another company that\u2019s made a move to historically make the head of Europe the head of overall sales. I wanted to ask, what \u2013 in terms of the motion that you\u2019re seeing successful in \u2013 outside of the U.S. that can be applied to the rest of the organization, and particularly inside the U.S., what plays are successful that you think can be run or expanded that will work? Bill McDermott : Well, first of all, I want to tip my cap to our regional presidents because they know I love \u2013 and I love all of them. We have great leadership with Mitch in APJ, great leadership with Mike in the Americas and now Ulrik coming on in EMEA. I know them all personally. I admire them deeply, and I really appreciate what they\u2019re doing for ServiceNow. And they\u2019re all playing critical roles in our future. Mike as an example has done an extraordinary job here for a very, very long period of time. And 65% of the number resides in his past. So he knows what we think of him. And I've always told our leaders that this is a significant company, and each piece of this puzzle needs to be managed with incredible care, and these are the leaders that will do that. Now Paul Smith brings a very unique style and know-how, especially around the expansion of the C-level relationships where he has proven himself in an exemplar fashion for the 18 months that he has been here. And as you know, we had a great track record before we got here. And he understands all the concepts that I put out on this call today because he's been through them and we're activating them together and we know exactly what we are doing. And the other thing is with CJ and the closeness that CJ and Kevin have had all these years, that continues. Kevin is still with me. And CJ is right with me. And Paul is right with me. So we're all putting this together, and we're going to activate it in every region and every industry and across every persona. And what I'm so inspired by is these executives. I respect them with my whole heart, and they're doing a fabulous job, and they want ServiceNow to be defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And they all want it as badly as I do, which is why I know it's going to happen. Alex Zukin : Thanks so much, guys and congratulations. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, what an incredible finisher, 2021. You have more than $5 billion in revenue, and you have close to 11 plus in RPO that you are hardly within sight of your long-term goal, Bill and team. So kudos on that wonderful milestone. Bill, my question for you is, certainly, your vision of the platform revolution taking over from the database, relational database, middleware, that whole stack old revolution is a very compelling one because you can bring value to customers, pressing problems immediately, right? So that's been the long-term thesis of ServiceNow. Now a little bit more tactically, as you head into 2022, we've got no need to reiterate, but very briefly, inflation pressures, labor shortage, supply chain shortage and a need to boost productivity despite all these constraints. How do you see the Now Platform being equipped to handle these challenges, these tactical challenges in the near-term for corporations with your execution? Thank you so much. Bill McDermott : Well, I really appreciate the question. Thank you so much for your kind remarks. I really do, Kash. Thanks a lot. ServiceNow has a unique ability to drive more efficiency and automate these processes and is absolutely a deflationary tool that helps alleviate the need for more hiring. Many companies think the only way to solve a problem is throw more bodies at it while we have no quarrel with increasing jobs. If there's a limited pool of digital assets, that's a problem. And that's why you need ServiceNow. So driving the productivity and efficiency out of the resources enterprises already have, helping them reduce the need for additional spend is our lead play in the playbook for the scenarios you laid out there. And one simple example, take virtual agents deflecting and automating tickets so that the IT help desk personnel can spend their time tackling more strategic issues, giving them more satisfaction with their job and creating a happier work environment. And this also reduces the need to hire more people in the first place. But then really smart CEOs are literally struggling every day now how I keep my people. And the only way to keep them is to give them a great experience. And they're going to feel you right out of the gates. If you recruited them and you can't onboard them properly, they're going to feel you if you can't train them and activate a customized training curriculum that's targeted specifically to their unique skills and attributes. And they're going to feel you real quick if they can't go to one portal to activate all of their services on their mobile device. So no matter where they are, their company's brand, their company's culture is talking to them. And then when you do need to manage these cases with people. My goodness, legal could be involved Finance could be involved. HR could be involved. COOs and CEOs could be involved. And most companies have literally thousands of cases that are in flight at any one time. Only ServiceNow, only ServiceNow can manage the multidisciplinary workflows that go across an organization in many different circular forms to close out a case properly. That's what we do, Kash. So I lean into the inflation conversation, the labor conversation with more and more activated now and straighting out supply chain dilemmas. We have one manufacturer in the auto industry that has us as the control tower for their entire supply chain now. A few years ago, nobody would even know that. We are solving ERP cases left, right and center with ServiceNow as the action platform. So I think the idea of this productivity, and I mentioned it in my discussion earlier, really manifests itself in our new impact product. We took a service, productized it in software where we can look at the entire value chain on the Now Platform, the entire value chain from the presale to the sale and the post-sale, all the activities that have taken place in the deployment in relation to the value that's being delivered in real-time with hard dollars and cents and an absolute measurement that the customer can look at on their iPhone, that the partner participates in the conversation. Incidentally, we're not using any other technology with the Now Platform and that ServiceNow can use. So now just think about the gorgeousness of that conversation where, as we deploy, we can show the business outcome. And the partner and ServiceNow and the customer are all on the same sheet of music on the Now Platform with ServiceNow Impact. Kash, it's amazing. We have 17 customers in the pilot join up on the Impact platform before we even launched it. We're now GA on it, and we're launching it with all of our employees globally tomorrow in every geography. This is going to create a renaissance of value delivery in the enterprise, the likes of which has never been seen before. Kash Rangan : Profoundly exciting. Thank you so much, Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And let me echo the congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. I want to follow-through on Kash's interesting question and kind of turn it inward to ServiceNow. And so Bill, from your perspective, do you see any constraints in terms of your partners finding the people or your customers finding the people to be able to deploy ServiceNow? We're hearing about that from some of our checks and some of the systems integrated. It's just such a tight labor market. Are the people there to sort of deploy the solution? Or could that become something of a friction to just getting ServiceNow up and running? And to Gina, are you seeing any incremental or increased wage inflation in terms of sort of \u2013 you guys are hiring very aggressively, and I think headcount is up 29% year-on-year. So you're definitely finding the people. Is there any increase in wage inflation or anything extraordinary on that side of the equation given that tight labor market that might impact margins on a go-forward basis? Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much for the question, Keith. As I mentioned earlier, we are one of these significant partners to the global SIs. So if you look at the top five technology partners for the top 10 SIs, we're one of them. So while they may have some difficulty hiring to meet demand, we are getting preferential resource allocation, not only as a top five technology partner, but also because our swelling pipeline and our growth is so amazing that they all want more of that real estate. And where they have less interesting growth scenarios with other partners, they're actually peeling off headcount in favor of the ServiceNow practice. This is happening all the place. In addition, one of the things we have done is we took matters into our own hands and built out academies. And we're doing more for university programs to meet the demand, the ServiceNow train talent. And I'd note that we've also been working with our partners to sponsor and engage with local diversity profit and nonprofits to target diverse populations for next-gen skill development, which will help alleviate such labor shortages in the future. We have to initiate people into the digital world that perhaps aren't initiated but it\u2019s certainly more than capable. And I always go back to the root cause of why ServiceNow is so special. When Fred Luddy created this company, he created a platform that was a sensation, and it was designed to give people productivity, a tool to enable them to do things with their lives and their jobs that they could have never done without it. And I think that level of simplicity and agility in the general construct of the platform makes it so much easier for people to learn and develop and grow on it. And now they see where we're going. They know it's a growth sensation. And you know how it is, rising tide kind of lift all boats, and everybody wants to get on this one. Gina Mastantuono : And then, Keith, on your question with respect to labor inflation rates. Enterprise software's talent has been in high demand for some time now. So competitive compensation has been on the rise, and it's not new for us. We continue to monitor it. We definitely anticipate some continued pressure in the coming quarters, but we remain very committed to our margin guidance that we've given you for 2022 and beyond. Keith Weiss : Upstanding. Thank you so much for the detail. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Keith. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Keith. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Michael Turits : Hey, thanks very much, guys and congrats on the quarter. One for Bill and one for Gina. So Bill, I want to talk about a couple of submarkets that you have made acquisitions and specifically in RPA and observability and how you're thinking about those markets and your strategy, whether this will be really directed at existing larger ServiceNow implementations or how directly you're going to go into those types of deals. And then something for Gina. Bill McDermott : Yes. Of course. Well, Michael, thank you very much. First of all, we are very excited about Ben, his leadership and the whole Lightstep team. As you know, they have been doing a great job winning amazing forward-thinking brands, and they have been doing a phenomenal job culturally integrating back into ServiceNow. So we are going to begin going to market with Lightstep, and that's going to be at mass scale, and that will be announced at the employee kickoff tomorrow. So that's exciting. And the work with Lightstep to not only serve the needs of IT but to observe things in a way that can be consumed across the value chain of decision-makers in an enterprise is pretty big. And then RPA, this whole process mining, RPA and AI, the platform for hyper automation is the ServiceNow platform. That's a huge point. And CJ and his great team, unbelievable team, they are making a major release in RPA, as you know, in our San Diego release. So more and more customers will benefit from the power of the ServiceNow platform, including RPA built into the San Diego release. It's an exciting release. What Amy Lokey and the team have done also on the user experience. I mean, we sort of demonstration of it with the Board. It's unbelievable. You know when you're dealing with ServiceNow because you're going to have one gorgeous user experience, and it doesn't matter what area of the platform you're looking to enable. It's all one gorgeous user experience. And I mean, I've never seen anything better. And it is the scale story all the way. And when we hit Tokyo in September, I hope to be in Tokyo with that announcement because I want to reach out to my great friends in Japan as a Japanese expression called dantotsu, and that underscores the spirit of ServiceNow to be better than the best. And that's the standard that we hold ourselves to. And the marketplace in Japan is really getting the memo on the power of ServiceNow and what we can do to liberate them into the cloud, and that\u2019s going to be an exciting part of our growth story. Michael Turits : Great. Thanks, Bill. And then, Gina, just some clarifications on the extension of the useful life. So you got essentially to flattish op margins but down a bit, like 70 bps on free cash flow. So just making sure that I understand it, and then obviously, you get that benefit to EBIT margins, but that flows through, and we see it on free cash flow because this is just a non-cash, and you\u2019re actually including expenses. So I want to make sure those mechanics are right. And then also, do you get in year two of this \u2013 do you get that tailwind to EBIT and accrual? Does that flip around to a headwind on EBIT margins and gross margins? Gina Mastantuono : Great question, Michael. So you\u2019re absolutely right, the benefit that you\u2019re seeing this year hit EBIT and operating margins, but not free cash flow, right, because it\u2019s just a change in depreciation, which is a non-cash, right? So that\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re seeing the benefit in operating income, but not in free cash flow. What you are seeing is free cash flow is the increased cost that I\u2019ve been talking about as the COVID savings start to fade in 2022 as we come back in person for digital events and in-person events and travel. With respect to the longer tail of this change in depreciation, it definitely tapers off and gets smaller, right? So it\u2019s a 100 basis point benefit this year by 2024. It goes down to just 50 points, right? So \u2013 and that\u2019s only on the EBIT margins, not on free cash flow. Michael Turits : Okay. Thanks very much Gina and Bill. Gina Mastantuono : Of course. Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Mike. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you. Bill, Gina, my congrats as well to you and the entire team and especially the CJ and the others that are so deservedly being elevated within the organization. Bill, you personally have been serving enterprise technology customers for many years. And many of us have been students of the industry for a long time as well. And I hesitate to say this, but it feels like this time is different. This digital transformation freight train just keeps steam rolling down the tracks. And rather than ask you to tell us about the environment, which is obviously very strong for what ServiceNow delivers, I would instead ask you, if you agree with my characterization, why do you think this time might be different? Bill McDermott : Thank you for the question. It is entirely different. It is entirely different because the technology that is available to customers today can be so transformative. And I believe strongly that the Now Platform from ServiceNow is literally the control tower, the platform for digital transformation or digital business. And the reason I feel so strongly about that is the enterprise has been so behind in consumerizing experiences for people. And now with ServiceNow, these leaders of companies can finally say, all I hear is good news. My HR leader tells me that all the clunkiness of the past goes away with ServiceNow, and my people are happy, and they\u2019re getting what they need. My Head of Revenue is telling me, wow, we could finally now do all the remote heavy thinking and diagnostics in a fully digital way, and we can bring our story to the customer and have that frictionless digital experience that\u2019s easily repeatable drives tremendous customer SAT and NPS and creates the loyalty effect. Wow, we\u2019re finally there. And then we can finally break through where companies are trying to refresh old applications. They can say, wow, now I can empower my people. They can build the new innovations. They can refresh the old but build the new innovations. And tech is the idea of liberating, not replacing people and creating more economic value and value-add. Plus every own person today doesn\u2019t want to work for just a paycheck. They want to purpose. And I think our purpose to make work better for everyone is absolutely the right way to go. And I think that the leaders of companies want that for their company. And therefore, I think the confluence of all of this on one platform with one consumer-grade user experience for all people, whether they\u2019re inside or outside the company, a platform that could take cost out and build revenue in is what this generation is waiting for. And once people are aware of ServiceNow, we win every time. So one of the moves that we\u2019ve made, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the pivot with the world works with ServiceNow, is bringing the world the brand that it deserves from ServiceNow. And I think that\u2019s going to really turn on a lot of people to say, aha, I might have been a C-level decision maker that knew my IT people were happy with ServiceNow. I just never knew why. Once I started to learn about it or asked about it, now I know that they can activate transformation in all dimensions of my company, not the least of which is be the action layer for the whole enterprise. And I keep telling people when I meet with the CEOs, like we have good systems of record. They\u2019re all very fine. But I don\u2019t use them. We only use ServiceNow to run ServiceNow. And that\u2019s why our people are so happy because everything works. Brad Zelnick : Awesome. Thank you for the perspective, Bill. Bill McDermott : Well, thank you, Brad. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Pat Walravens : Great. Thanks very much. Bill, congrats on the terrific results and outlook. I love hearing the enthusiasm. Could you drill down deeper for us on the relationship with Celonis? And how ServiceNow and Celonis work together to solve customers\u2019 problems? Bill McDermott : Yes, I absolutely will. And thank you very much for your kind remarks, and we appreciate it. I want to go back a little bit in time on this one. There once was a time where these gentlemen graduated from Technical University of Munich. We call it TUM over in Germany. And I got to know Alex very well several years ago and also his co-founders, and we built a very strong friendship. And he used to laugh because he sent me a note in December telling me about his business. And within a few minutes, I\u2019d get back to him, and he never forgot that. And I still get back to him within a few minutes, and we still have a great friendship. And we know that we have delivery the past and move it into the cloud. We know we need to put it on an automation platform that can really change business. And therefore, in the non-ServiceNow environments, especially where it\u2019s an ERP environment, Celonis does a very good job in the process mining to actually understand where the breaks are and the opportunities are in the business process to drive business productivity and performance. It is on that basis that we said, look, we should team up because our customers more and more are asking us to get involved, automating back-office business operations and business processes with the Now Platform. So we are essentially taking this relationship and applying automation that truly move the needle for organizations to understand how workflows across the people, processes and systems of their companies. And we\u2019re helping map those elements in real time and building digital workflows to more efficiently automate work because the X-ray by itself doesn\u2019t really help. We have to then put it on the action platform to actually automate it to drive a result. So our engineering teams have created a seamless product experience that\u2019s going to make it easy and simple for customers to get the insight into the process across multiple, I might add, enterprise systems, and they\u2019ll use Celonis EMS platform and convert that insight into action, automation and remediation with the ServiceNow workflow platform. And when you bring together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development, and this touches on a question that came up earlier, low-code app development into a seamless product experience, customers will enable quick, continuous improvement with the flow of work. And I stress quick because \u2013 and this touches on an earlier, very smart question. These opportunities haven\u2019t been there for customers in the past, and they\u2019re only going to start learning about them now, which is why I see an even bigger hockey stick as we look into the future because we can revolutionize old installed base problems into new market opportunities in the cloud that are just sensational in terms of the business value they drive for corporations all over the world. Pat Walravens : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you, Bill. Bill McDermott : My pleasure. Thank you for the question, Pat. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from the line of Drew Glaeser with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Drew Glaeser : Hi. This is Drew on for Sterling. I was just wondering how the government vertical performed in the quarter and whether you could provide some more detail on that. Bill McDermott : Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. Our government business is truly a growth story at ServiceNow that is very, very special. So we look at the tailwinds in the U.S. federal market. It came through very strongly. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us. What\u2019s happening through is many of these agencies, they need or they have a mandate actually to digitally transform. One of the mandates is the President\u2019s management agenda of PMA. Their vision is the administration\u2019s guide to invest in the government\u2019s capacity to deliver better results. And it\u2019s aligning with ServiceNow\u2019s core offering. So for example, if you look at the pillars, it\u2019s all about strengthening and empowering federal workflow in the workforce. It\u2019s sharing data, sharing business processes, looking at things across boundaries. They have delivered excellent equitable and secure federal services and customer experiences. This is driving acceleration for better customer service. If you look at their pillar three, it\u2019s managing the business of government and that they want to make sure the systems work well. So this is all about business resiliency. Our cloud is extremely resilient. And they\u2019re focused also on cybersecurity. And I think you\u2019re familiar with that and the role that we could play in having a control tower for all the things going on from a security perspective. We can help other people\u2019s solutions also tie into that control tower effect to manage the nation\u2019s cybersecurity and obviously avoid recent ransomware attacks and other things. They\u2019re also focused on vaccine management. And we said a long time ago, I believe this was in March of 2020 when we said this that the old vaccine management process would be the greatest workflow challenge that government faces maybe in our lifetime. And as you know, we have the world\u2019s leading solution for that with entire countries. Of course, part of the United States, Germany, Scotland, many countries, including in Asia running on the Now Platform for vaccine management and returning to work safely and so forth. So all of this, to net it out, basically says that at the federal, the state, the local, the university and all public entities combined are focused on transforming digitally. They have to take these paper-based slow dangerous processes and put them in order. And the only way to do that is work home, digitize them and then execute the mission of government serving the people. And that\u2019s why the public sector now represents double digits of the Now business, about 10% of our business. And look, with the problems the government has in digitizing things, this should be one of the more sensational industry stories for us for a long, long time, which is one of the reasons why the great Kevin Haverty and I will be working very, very closely on the public sector initiative globally in his new capacity. Drew Glaeser : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Drew. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Drew. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Darren Yip, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Darren Yip : Good afternoon and thank you for joining ServiceNow's first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our first quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call such as our guidance is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2021 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. We'd like to also point out that we have presented non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments.  To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today, we're pleased to once again report results that firmly beat expectations. In January we reported a stellar 2021. Today, we're following that up with a very strong Q1. The constant currency numbers speak for themselves. Subscription revenue growth was 29%, CRPO growth was 30.5%, operating margin surpassed 25%. And all were above the high end of our guidance range. In fact, our raised guidance today which Gina will cover shortly also speaks for itself. As does the 52 deals over $1 million in Q1 that were up 41% year-over-year. It's clear that the world is beginning to understand the power of this platform. We said in January that our fast growth would accelerate in Q1, it did. Now, three months later, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate for the full year, it will.  We said that ServiceNow's fast growth would continue to be paired with the leverage of a global market leader. Now, with our accelerating revenue growth and free cash flow, we're already approaching the rule of 60 for the full year. We have strong adoption from existing and net new customers. Our rolling four quarter pipeline remains ever strong. We're delivering predictable, fast growth with exceptional free cash flow.  Overall, we're super excited about the state of this business. We believe it sets us up really well, for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. I do want to offer a few comments on what we're seeing in the broader marketplace. We've talked about a sustained demand environment for the enterprise. While there are significant challenges in the world, particularly in the Eastern European situation, we have not seen a material impact on our market. To the contrary, the challenges have underscored the urgency of investment in digital business.  IDC continues to see a 23% year-over-year increase in the global public cloud market for 2022. We see similar indications of demand durability, which are consistent with or above the tenure pre COVID average. Leaders who do plan to adjust their technology budget plan to increase investments in 2022. One leader put it well. He said Bill, if we slow investment in the short term, we'll lose ground in the midterm, and we won't be in business for the long term and quote.  And the data tells the same story. The average tenure of a company in the S&P 500 has declined from 30 years in 1996 to 19 years in 2021. So it's very clear that business can no longer revert to a status quo posture, no matter the environment. We're now in a tech to compete world. If you look to our new customer acquisition, here is what resonates.  Businesses is shifting investments in technologies that get them to the right outcomes faster. Cloud native platforms like ServiceNow are seen as an elixir to speed up new revenue streams and better experiences for people.  When we say increase focus on topics like supply chain, risk, security, ESG, all of these convert who's perceived what was perceived headwinds into much stronger secular tailwinds for service now, so the world's biggest problems are really ServiceNow's biggest opportunities. And it all adds up to what we said consistently. The technology architecture is now the business architecture. This is the era for digital business. Our businesses are firing on all cylinders in this environment, behind great experiences or great workflows, which underscores the unique extensibility of the ServiceNow platform. So here it is. Our core technology workflows business performed well in Q1, ITSM was in 11 of our top 20 deals, which continued strong adoption of ITSM Pro. We continue to see strong attach rates from ITOM in 13 of our top 20 deals. Security and Risk had a great quarter with a combined 13 deals in the top 20. Global biotech innovator, Regeneron, works with ServiceNow to increase productivity while decreasing costs. Global financial leader, RBC, works with ServiceNow for cloud and asset tracking. I'd also like to thank RBC for administering the ServiceNow racial equality fund. The only way for companies to transform the customer experience is to fully integrate their employee experience. Customer workflows continue to see strong demand, particularly with our vertical SKUs. Barclays works with ServiceNow to automate cross-agency case management and compliance with EU data privacy requirements. In this post-pandemic economy, many businesses are creating direct-to-consumer business models. Companies like Telefonica Brazil work with ServiceNow to better serve their next-generation customers. Employee workflows were also strong in the quarter. HR was in 14 of the top 20 deals. Global health care solutions company, AmerisoBergen, works with ServiceNow to transform their employee experience. In the digital business era, differentiation can't be bought, it must be built. IDC now forecasted 750 million net new applications will be created between 2023 and 2025. With the unprecedented demand for net new innovation together with a global shortage of professional developers, low-code application development is a massive market opportunity. While tech leaders see the value of citizen developers, they don't want to sacrifice the enterprise-grade governance and security. This is what gives ServiceNow a unique differentiation in the low-code market. Look at Daichi Life Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance companies, which is standardized on app engine for all low-code application development. With creative workflows in 16 of the top 20 Q1 deals, we see this trend accelerate. A leading manufacturer of print inks, DIC, works with ServiceNow as their new citizen developer platform, one of many such examples. Here's the key takeaway, businesses are no longer in the mood to experiment. They go with what they know works, which is why the world works with ServiceNow. We are the only one with a fully integrated platform architecture that can address every C-suite business challenge because enterprises are so focused now on fast time to value. Our new customer success subscription offering, ServiceNow Impact, also saw a strong demand in Q1. And as ever, the ServiceNow platform is the foundation for our ongoing success. We're encouraged by the extremely favorable reception from our San Diego platform release. In particular, users love the next experience, which streamlines navigation, make search intelligent and simplifies personalization all on our platform. We also unveiled a new automation engine, which makes it simple for users to do robotic process automation on the ServiceNow platform. Only ServiceNow can help businesses unify their approach to hyper automation. We now orchestrate AI, RPA and other key technologies on a single local platform. Fred Luddy founded our company in San Diego. So this release was an especially proud moment for all of us. I'd like to personally salute our product and engineering teams for the transformational work they delivered in our San Diego release. Congratulations, team. Outstanding job. Looking forward, we see many positive developments that affirm our confidence in this business. Investment from our partner ecosystem continues to accelerate nicely. Thierry Delaporte, CEO of Wipro, said the following, \"Bill, we couldn't be more excited about the potential of ServiceNow. You bring a whole new dimension to customer success and technology innovation. We are all in.\" This outstanding partnership with Wipro is only just getting started. We also have our signature event series, Knowledge 22, taking place in May. Each of four locations will demonstrate the high enthusiasm of the growing ServiceNow community. We will have showcases in The Hague, New York City, Sydney and Las Vegas, in addition to a fully digital experience. So please join us. So in closing, we had a great Q1. Everything is lined up for us to follow suit in Q2 and for the full year. We're taking steps forward every day to our stated milestone, $10 billion-plus by 2024, $15 billion-plus by 2026 and beyond. It's worth reiterating at this time that we remain on track to be the fastest ever to hit those thresholds. Finally, beyond the business results, I'd like to offer the heartfelt support of our more than 18,000 ServiceNow colleagues worldwide to those confronting humanitarian crisis, especially in Ukraine. Like so many of our customers and peers, ServiceNow is pursuing numerous opportunities to support relief efforts. By continuing to do well, we confer to commit our company to doing good. This is firmly aligned to our purpose of making the world work better for everyone. Herein lies our path to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Ladies and gentlemen, we are a company on the move. I'd like to thank you again for your time and your trust in ServiceNow. We're looking forward to addressing any questions you may have. And I'll now hand it over to our great CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina? Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q1 was yet another fantastic quarter of execution. Enterprises are navigating a macro environment filled with a myriad of challenges. Our ability to continue delivering strong results exemplifies the resiliency of our business and the mission-critical nature of the NOW platform. The breadth of our product offering and our geographic reach provide us a diverse array of opportunities for growth. Although FX headwinds grew throughout the quarter, ServiceNow outperformed across all of our Q1 guidance metrics. In fact, net new ACV growth accelerated year-over-year, driving the fastest Q1 growth we've seen since 2018. We expect that momentum will carry into Q2 with net new ACV growth consistent with our very strong second quarter last year. As a result, we're raising the midpoint of 2022 subscription revenue guidance to more than offset these incremental FX headwinds. Turning to Q1 results. Subscription revenues were $1.631 billion, growing 29% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $16 million. This reflects a 300 basis point acceleration in growth year-over-year. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion, representing 31.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.69 billion, representing 30.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 1-point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, we saw broad-based strength with energy and utilities, financial services, government, health care, life sciences, TMT, and transportation and logistics all growing net new ACV 40% or more year-over-year. Our renewal rate was best-in-class at 98% in Q1 as the NOW platform remains a core component of our customers' digital transformation efforts. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon as our largest customers continue to expand. We finished the quarter with more than 1,400 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. We closed 52 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in Q1, up 41% year-over-year. This includes seven net new logo deals in the quarter, further demonstrating our success with initiatives to land quality customers. Our portfolio outside of ITSM is also leading more of our largest customer land. Nine out of our top 10 new customer deals were led by non-ICSM products. Turning to profitability. Operating margins surpassed 25%, driven by our revenue beat and certain spend that shifted into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 45%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.5 billion in cash and investments, putting us in excellent shape to continue investing in strategic initiatives that drive growth. Together, these results demonstrate our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. And perhaps even more relevant this year is resiliency and predictability of our business model. While a diversity of markets and customers provide stability in our results, the diversity of our employee base continues to make us even stronger. Last week, we released our second annual Global Impact Report. Just as the ServiceNow platform helps us fully integrate customer, employee and technology experiences across our business, we'll continue to use the ServiceNow ESG management and reporting solutions to manage, govern and report our progress. While we're early in our ESG journey, we're extremely proud of our accomplishments in such a short time.  We've made significant improvements in representation and hiring. We've tied executive compensation to both environmental and diversity goals. We fully distributed ServiceNow's $100 million racial equity fund, and we've continued to achieve systemic pay equities. I'm happy with the progress we've made in 2021, but we're just getting started. Moving on to guidance. As the conflict in Ukraine intensified throughout Q1, we continue to see an incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar, resulting in further FX headwinds in 2022. However, on a constant currency basis, the underlying health of our business has remained ever strong. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our subscription revenue outlook by $23 million to more than offset the incremental $20 million headwind we're seeing from FX, resulting in a net increase of $3 million. Our new range of $7.025 billion to $7.04 billion represents 26% year-over-year growth. That's 28.5% growth on a constant currency basis, a 50 basis point raise versus our previous outlook. This reflects our updated expectation for constant currency growth to now accelerate year-over-year. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, operating margin of 25% and free cash flow margin of 31%. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 204 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.67 billion and $1.675 billion representing 26% year-over-year growth, which is inclusive of a 3-point FX headwind. On a constant currency basis, we expect subscription revenue growth to be 29%, a 250 basis point acceleration from Q2 2021. We expect CRPO growth of 25% year-over-year or 28% on a constant currency basis. I'd note that for full year 2022, we have a larger-than-average customer cohort that renews in Q4. We will see between one and two points of increasing headwinds to Q2 and Q3 CRPO growth as those contractual obligations wind down. When the cohort renews, though, in Q4, those headwinds will subside, and we expect CRPO growth to reaccelerate quarter-over-quarter. We expect an operating margin of 22%, which reflects the timing of marketing spend that shifted from Q1 into Q2 and some incremental FX. We expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, Q1 was another outstanding quarter. Our momentum is setting us up for a great year. As Bill highlighted, we're excited about our San Diego release. Our future innovation pipeline is robust, as we seek to extend our market leadership, deepening our competitive moat as the platform for digital business. ServiceNow is incredibly well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  I'd like to invite you all to hear more about the momentum we're seeing and learn more about our new products and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 24 in Las Vegas. Finally, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter. Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication.  And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question and a really nice quarter. Actually, two questions. One, just on kind of the overall macro backdrop and how you guys are kind of performing so well against that. One, is there any geographic differences? Like are you seeing any difference in sort of behavior in Europe versus behavior in the U.S. or Asia Pac? Or is it pretty much consistent across the board? And two, is there any -- like if you think about this period of time versus what we saw in 2020, right, and we were dealing with the COVID pandemic, are there any similarities or differences to point to in terms of what you're seeing now versus what you saw then? Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much, Keith. First of all, in terms of then and now, in both cases, the world's biggest challenges are ServiceNow's biggest opportunities. And if you remember, we stepped right up to the emergency response, returned to work safely. And that really spurred on a whole new business for ServiceNow, but more importantly, to establish the brand as a leader. The case is also true now. The war in Ukraine, the rising inflationary environment, interest rates and dislocated supply chains, these are all opportunities for the NOW platform because this is the unique attribute of ServiceNow. We're an enterprise software market leader. Most of the companies, where they have felt the negative impacts of the environment, have a consumer business that will be probably impacted from these forces, but the enterprises are basically saying it's a tech to compete world, and I have to invest now because I'm already, in many cases, falling behind. For example, just two years ago, one-third of the business was getting done in digital formats. Today, it's two-third and two years, it will be 90-plus percent. So if you don't get digital fast, you lose.  The other thing, we're in a war for talent in the global economy, like that's never been seen before at this level. And there's unique attributes of how the software has to take care of the people. You have to recruit them, hire them, but you have to onboard them. That's one of the moments of truth that nobody does the way we do it. So they feel part of the culture and where they're working from. And then, of course, you have to give the consumer great experience to differentiate you. That is also true for the customer on a direct-to-consumer level and obviously creating the gaps on the low-code platform. So what I'm saying is, the world needs these problems solved, so we can help manage those macro effects that you're talking about. So the environment feels somewhat like it did then in that context, but we're redoubling our focus and our optimism across all employees anywhere in the world because all of our customers need us. So again, I think the unique differentiation is our clear focus on the enterprise and our consistent innovation. And on the geography scenario, it obviously will vary by quarter here and there. They're all strong. Americas was particularly strong, but all of our regions have strong pipelines and every reason to believe that it will be a consistent across-the-board effort everywhere in the world. Keith Weiss : Outstanding. Congratulations on a really nice quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a real nice quarter here. The thing that really stands out to me is just the broad strength that you're seeing across different departments, ITSM, employee workflows, ITOM, security risk. These are multiple lines of business. My question is, what has changed about the go-to-market such that you're able to bridge the gap across so many different departments and find relevance for your solutions there? Is the global SI channel a key to that? Are there things that have changed in just your internal go-to-market as well? Thank you. Bill McDermott : Brad, thank you for your kind words, and also, you're on to something here. We became a platform company, Brad. We started out in IT and where you have a very proud technical excellence for the IT leaders around the world. And they really get behind ServiceNow in a big way because they know it works. And what happened along the way with this digital transformation world that we're living in right now, IT really became the business strategy because it's the only way to keep your business secure. It's the only way to make sure your employees can get what they need to do their work no matter where they're working from. It's the only way to reach out and innovate with those new next-generation customers who will only do business with you digitally. And ultimately, this creative workflow is massive because the number of applications that will be developed in the next three years supercede the number that have been built in the last half century. And there's not enough engineers in the world to do that, and they're doing that in record numbers on ServiceNow. But here is the big difference. When we became the platform company, the leaders that believes in us that were generationally from the IT environment wants to grow with ServiceNow. I can do all this on one architecture, one platform, one data model, and I can give all the constituents of our enterprise with the need to win, whether they're in the HR department, sales and marketing, they couldn't be in the field service or they could just simply be citizen developers trying to do something to help the company. And now I can do all that but govern it, make sure it's compliant and make sure the innovation is always tethered to the investments we've made in the past, so we can have a brighter future. And that's the big difference. And internally, we've moved to a solutions by industry and persona and business impact company along the lines of that platform, and everybody is super excited about where we're going. Brad Sills : That\u2019s great to hear. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Your line is open. Arjun Bhatia : Perfect. Thank you very much. And I will add my congrats on a great quarter. Bill, maybe I want to follow up on your conversation about inflation earlier. I'm sure you're seeing hosting costs go up, labor costs are increasing. At the same time, right, with your product, you're adding more value to customers. You've talked about ServiceNow being a deflationary platform, I mean you're innovating. But how do you think about pricing in this environment for your solution? Is there an opportunity to be more aggressive as you add more value and to try to maybe offset some of the costs that are increasing on the OpEx side? Bill McDermott : No, it's a really good question, Arjun. I think the main thing to take away from this is when you are in a privileged position because the technology has such a strong advantage, in software, if you do it right, you shouldn't have discount thresholds that behave like doing it wrong. So in software, if you can control your pricing algorithm and make sure that you're getting the price you deserve for your product because it has a well-constructed business impact that's been clearly defined with the customer, you find that you can actually improve price/performance without exacting large enterprise change to the customer. And that's what we're really seeing. We're really seeing a professionalism around how we comport our story, the power and impact of the platform and how we can make that fully transparent to our customers. And we even invented an application that they're using on their business iPhones right now where they can see the impact of the projects they do with ServiceNow and the return on those investments as they are tethered to the original business case that was done at the point of sale. That's the level of precision that I'm unaware of another enterprise company operating on. So it's really about value. It's really about business impact, and our customers are buying in. Arjun Bhatia : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open. Karl Keirstead : Hi, thanks. Gina I just wanted to give you a chance to elaborate on the U-shape CRPO trajectory in 2022. And in particular, I just wanted to clarify the 1 to 2-point sequential headwind to that metric. So does that mean that the 28% guide in 2Q would be maybe 29%, 30% normalized? And then in 3Q, do you get another 1- to 2-point headwind before you get that acceleration in 4Q? Love any color you can provide, as I think others on the call would. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Karl. That's exactly right. And so basically, what we're saying is that there's a 1- to 2-point impact in Q2 and Q3 because of this new -- this large renewal cohort. And so if you think about a renewal and a customer that at the end of Q4 2021 had $1 million. And that's up for renewal in Q4 in 2022, in Q4 of last year, the RPO would have had $1 million, then in Q1, it would have had $750,000. Then in Q2, it would have had $500 million; Q3, $250,000. So that's the impact that we're talking about. And we've quantified it for you at between 1% to 2%, and you've got it exactly right how you're talking about it with the math. Karl Keirstead : Okay, super helpful. Thanks Gina. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Philip Winslow : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another just outstanding quarter. Bill, thanks for all the color you gave on just the feedback you're getting from customers in terms of just the prioritization of IT spending and ServiceNow. And it really doesn't feel like you're leaning into that opportunity. When I look at sales and marketing head count, that's up 25% year-over-year.  My question is, I guess, twofold. One, what are your goals just for hiring in this line for the year? And are there any areas where you think ServiceNow is going to be leaning into, whether it be geographic or vertical functionality? And then Gina, I wonder if you could just comment on the sales productivity ramp time that you're seeing? Bill McDermott : Phil, thank you very much, Phil. What's really wonderful about ServiceNow is we just crossed our 18,000th employee that we'll be onboarding in the next week or so. So we continue to be the place people want to work. And that's super exciting because in this environment, I get phone calls from other Boards of Director members telling me there's no boomerang going back to their company from ServiceNow because people are choosing so many options within the ServiceNow family. As you know, we hired very heavily in R&D. This is an innovation machine. It's a growth machine. And we also are cognizant of sales and marketing to make sure that the things we do tend to have a quota-carrying equation associated with them. So the leverage is there for shareholders. So Gina will give you some of the facts and figures on it. But I just think it's super important to have a brand that's the place people want to be, especially in this very, very tight labor market for digital skills. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. And I would just add, Phil, that you're seeing the numbers, Q1 headcount up 28% year-over-year in this environment is pretty phenomenal, and hats off to our HR function and recruiting function and all of the teams for being able to do that. But you're seeing it right. We continue to invest in sales and marketing and R&D. It's really about driving innovation and sales and marketing, really getting that strong go-to market, that we have been talking about. We talked about for the full year expecting hiring in the high 20s, and we're absolutely on that trajectory to continue that. With respect to productivity with the sales folks, we're definitely seeing good productivity increases year-over-year in Q1 and expect to see that continue throughout the year. So go-to-market teams are executing very well. We feel really good about the results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on just another very great quarter for you guys in a tough environment. Maybe during the quarter, we went to the Federal Forum. And it was great to see attendance there be very robust. It felt like we were back to the pre-COVID times. And I'm just curious, have you seen the demand to match that and particularly with the higher DoD IL-5 level certification. How should we think about that in terms of opening up new opportunities and expanding the TAM within the federal sector that you're targeting? Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much, Samad, first of all, for attending. We really appreciate it. As you know, that forum was really successful. It was done in person, and it was the most successful Federal Forum we've ever had, and it happened post the COVID in the sense that people started to travel a little bit again. I think you called it really well. I think the big sensational outcome from that was not only that U.S. federal saw 100% growth on a year-over-year basis in what we refer to as net new average contract value. But you also see the certification on IL-5 really taking off, and I believe that our partnership with Microsoft will show up very big, specially congratulate Microsoft and Satya on having a very strong quarter. I wish him well. It's fantastic. And we have very good partnership with them. So I think we can solve a lot of problems for U.S. federal is a big market opportunity. And the President's management agenda and the administration's guide to their constituents is really for the government to deliver results fast, drive digital transformation, and they're adopting the NOW platform as a standard. And we're only one of a couple, there's three total, including Microsoft, that are IL-5 certified. So I think you caught on to something here that could be a wellspring of opportunity. I'll finally close off this workplace service delivery capability of ServiceNow and on a safe workplace applications have seen the strongest interest from federal customers. And again, that's fueled by the Biden administration's agenda. And the quote that I would give you, as I remember it, they said that federal will lead the way to returning to work now. So this is a very strong business for us. Incidentally, that TAM for the government marketplace globally is an enormous TAM, as you know. So being a leader in U.S. federal, also we're doing a lot in state and local, is quite a statement. And I think that, that will drive growth around the world. Samad Samana : Very helpful. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Let me comment my congratulations on the spectacular quarter. Bill, I think you've got the macro argument pretty well nailed. I'm not going to ask that question, but I'm curious to get your thoughts as you scale the company to 15-plus, I noticed the plus after 15. How do you think about distribution, given that you've run big distribution of big companies so far? The customer count of 7,000, 8,000 certainly is very impressive, big deal sizes.  As we envision the life beyond 15-plus, what is the go-to-market structure of the company look like? Are we looking at a 2-tier, 3-tier type distribution, predominantly go-to-market, high-end, channel, SI, et cetera? Help us envision the future, Bill, to get to your target. Thank you so much and congrats. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Kash, for the question. So the distribution, I again reiterate, our focus right now is on the enterprise. We're an enterprise software market leader. We have lots of work still left to do in geographic expansion for the company. There's a huge opportunity in markets like Japan, obviously, all across Europe, LatAm. I really like to focus on markets like Canada, of course, trade markets, the way they want to be treated in that localized style. We obviously have lots of expansion rights in the Middle East and other places. And I'm looking at bellwether markets like Germany, France and the U.K., which are already now starting to take off beautiful. So there's a geographic component. We also have segmented the way we develop software and take that software to market by industry. And as you know, we're very focused on your industry, of course, financial services, one, but there's telecom, there's manufacturing, there's every industry under the sun in motion, but we've gone strong with 6, including life sciences and so forth. And then persona-based. If you think about taking this platform across the enterprise, you have to speak intelligently to all the C-level executives that run the enterprise. And we have a Rubik's Cube formula around the geography, the industry and the persona that's now being executed at an art form level by our great marketing communications leader and his team. So I'm super impressed with that. We also did something, I think, very interesting with life step that a lot of people haven't picked up on, but life step is a next-generation customer platform. And when you think about having one user experience across the whole enterprise, where people are in and out different screen styles to figure out what they're observing, you also have an observability platform that is a direct-to-consumer platform by design that I think is a precursor to many of the things we can do with the core.  And also, we could take the core and put it in prepackaged, ready-to-run solutions and build an ecosystem around that and turn on a whole new channel of small and mid-market channel partners as we take the company everywhere. And so now, on the big partner channel, there isn't a single one out there in the top 10 that doesn't at least start with a B, meaning we don't have million-dollar conversations, we have billion-dollar conversations, and we even have the top one now chasing $10 billion. So I mean, Kash, in short, we're going to chase every market opportunity all over the world, and we're going to win. And we have a team that's ready to conquer this market like never before. It's so exciting here right now, Kash. I just wish you could be in the building to see it. Gina Mastantuono : And on that note, Kash, I hope to see you on May 24 at Investor Day because we'll talk a lot about what we look like at $10 billion and $15 billion-plus. So hope to see you there. Kash Rangan : I'm already there. Definitely seeing you there. Bill McDermott : That's great. But can you feel it, Kash? Can you feel the building? Kash Rangan : I can. Absolutely. Congratulation. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, really as a follow-up to that last question. You mentioned of observability. You guys recently launched incident management platform. I think it's really infused with light step and observability. I'm wondering if you can talk about the importance of that offering. And maybe just double-click again on sort of why you think you're going to win in observability, because it seems like a huge market opportunity for you guys? Bill McDermott : Well, the first thing to recognize here Matt, is huge market opportunities don't require anyone for -- to lose for us to win. They're huge market opportunities. So we'll still integrate, as we already do, with the largest participants in that market. And we want them to be successful because customers have invested in them and our way of going about things is that's great, let's make that customer successful together. That's why they integrate seamlessly into the NOW platform. At the same time, we have many customers that realize that ServiceNow can out-innovate just about anybody in the marketplace, so they want us to do more for them. And clearly, observability was one of those categories. And we just got there a lot faster with light step because we believe Ben and his team are the most innovative in the industry. And we're just so proud to have such trust and partnership with them and such big dreams together. So Lightstep launched incident response, as you said. It's the first new product since joining ServiceNow, and it's big. So incident response will add a lot of context and automation to the incident response process, and customers are looking for that. And by the way, they may even have more than one incident response vendor in there. So we don't rail against others. What we try to do is work for the customer. We've put our part hard hat on, roll up our sleeves and we go to work. Lightstep also launched an industry-first unification of observed billing analytics, and they also get collaborative notebooks. So these innovations are breaking down those silos I referenced between metrics and tracing and streamlining its critical SRE workflow space. So in Q1, for example, we signed some cool deals along with Plaid, which we're very proud of. And that's a data networking company, as you know, and they're powering the Fintech and digital finance product space, and they're using Lightstep for complete visibility into distributed architectures, and they're allowing Plaid to investigate CI and CV issues, and they're doing it 20 times faster than they used to. And we also got Airtable, again, cool brand, next-generation brand, and they're building collaborative applications, and they're driving the reliability of complex distributed systems and proactively improving performance for users, and again, more effectively monitoring and resolving both system-wide and specific customer issues, but they're doing it with one UI, and they're not balancing people in and out of different experiences. And this is what I keep going back to when you talk about real platform innovation and the integrity of a consumer-grade experience, and you can do that across an entire enterprise. That's why I believe our Board of Directors did a great job of defining enterprise software company in the 21st century is doing it with a DESCO 21C logo. So now we have 18,000 people that all they think about is DESCO 21C, whether you're innovating, covering a customer or just driving the conversation. We know where we're going. Matt Hedberg : Well said. Congrats, Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Y our line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on the truly inspiring quarter-end message in a tough tape. I guess maybe just two for me, Bill. You talked about the health of the federal vertical on the call. I was wondering if you could also maybe comment on some of the other verticals that you're seeing success in and saw success in the quarter and how we should think about just greater verticalization in the product itself, either for telco or Fiserv or others? And then just a follow-up for Gina. Bill McDermott : Sure. Sure. Well, thank you very much, Alex, for your very kind remarks. It means a lot to us. Our team is doing a really great job. And when they hear that, you just inspire us to go higher, and we appreciate it. So thank you. We've done a lot in terms of the vertical coverage. We have our great Chief Operating Officer, CJ Desai, now not only running all of engineering with what we believe to be the best engineering team in the business, but also, he's overseeing our industry orientation and the whole go-to-market around that. And he teams up in a beautiful way with the go-to-market team, our leader Paul Smith and great regional presence. We have just super proud of our team. But banking is really simplifying the whole middle to back-office operation context, and financial services is going really well. I referenced Barclays, but there's just so many that are all-in on ServiceNow. Our telecommunication solution is really aligning customer care and service assurance, transforming -- just think about how communication service providers deliver great customer experiences. And you can't get away with fixing problems anymore. You've got to proactively anticipate these issues before they even come up. And if they do come up, you've got to address them quickly to maximize availability and quality of service. So we're seeing a lot of traction in telecommunications and we're really becoming the standard across the board. We're super happy with manufacturing and what we're doing there, operations technology management, driving the whole notion of what these manufacturers are trying to do to have their critical technology available and provide visibility and security of all of their assets. Another one I would underscore is health care and life sciences service management. How do you connect cross functional health systems and teams and simplify how people engage with the health care providers, payers, pharma companies and medical device organizations? It's all about the patient experience. And high-tech manufacturing, another one that's really come on strong for us. I mean I could give you more, but those are the ones that are just rocking right now. And one theme I will give you is you can't give a customer a 3-star Michelin experience unless you first give it to your employees. And the NOW platform is really controlling the conversation now for enlightened decision-makers because they're like, I've got to tether my IT excellence to the employee experience, and I've got to take care of my customers in new and highly innovative ways.  And this platform does the magic they need done, but it does it in days or weeks, not months and months and months and years. And finally, in all these solutions, we're cooperating with those systems of record. The customer knows that they're there and they've got them and they're very important to their business. So we just come in quickly and make everything better for everyone. Alex Zukin : That's awesome. Very inspiring, Bill. Gina, I guess the follow-up for you, you talked about accelerating growth in new ACV in the quarter. Again, which is quite rare for a company of your size to do quarter in, quarter out, not to mention in this type of macro environment. I guess the question is, as the comps get tougher through the year, but you do start returning to more in-person events, presumably more productivity from the sales force. Is it possible to see that type of new ACV momentum continue? Gina Mastantuono : So we -- I talked about in my prepared remarks that we expect Q2 to show accelerating net new ACV growth as well, consistent. Whether that lasts for the full year, they're pretty incredible comps. And so we obviously don't guide to full year net new ACV, Alex. But the reason I spoke about it specifically was really because I wanted everyone to feel confident that the CRPO guide, although slightly less than Q1, really had this impact, right? And that it wasn't driving -- it wasn't a result of the underlying business that, in fact, we're seeing accelerating net new ACV in Q1 and expect similar in Q2. So that was the reason for my comment. I'm so proud of our entire organization for being able to drive an acceleration of this scale at our scale. And just really excited about the momentum we're seeing into Q2. We feel really strong and good about the guide for the full year. And the momentum that we're seeing in Q1, we expect to be consistent throughout the year. Alex Zukin : Crystal clear guys. Thanks so much. Congratulations. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz : Thanks very much. And I'll add my congrats on a really good quarter. Bill, we all tend to think about ITSM as the workhorse for ServiceNow, but it's interesting that it was only included in 11 of your top 20 deals, which is quite a bit less than what we usually see. And I think you mentioned also that 9 of your top 10 were led by non-ITSM products. So do you look at this Q1 result with respect to this metric as more of an anomalous outcome? Or do you think it's reflective of ServiceNow increasingly landing and expanding with other workflow automation solutions? Bill McDermott : Gregg, it's a great question. Actually, we're so encouraged with our core. Our core is growing beautifully. And if you look at the revenue outcome from our core, it's right there at the corporate rate. So what you're seeing has nothing to do with any dilution in that core business. On the contrary, we've got enormous uplift with our Pro SKU, as you know. That's a 25% uplift. So it's 30% penetrated now. So there's lots of people that like it and there's many more to go. So we have lots of room left on the Pro SKU. If you think about the kind of customers where we're winning, I mean, the great brands, Amerisource Bergen, Baptist Health, Regeneron, DIC pharma -- I mean it goes on and on. Royal Bank of Canada, Telefonica. Every -- Wipro, for example, just like sort of complete generational change with it. So let me make sure I make it clear. The core business has never been stronger. There's no revenue dilution whatsoever. What is happening, we are landing and expanding. And you're right, the IT concept really did form the basis for us to move into the employee experience, the customer experience, the whole creative workflow where citizen developers are now really creating the future they want to see. And without that ever solid magnificent core, none of that would have been possible. So I want to really set the record straight. Our team is doing great across all these segments. The newer or the younger ones are obviously going to get some more land and expand opportunities. But we love on our core, and we love our leaders. Gregg Moskowitz : That\u2019s fantastic. Super helpful. Thanks Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. And I'll echo the congrats on a really nice quarter. Bill, when the pandemic hit, you were able to operate at a really high level virtually. But as a platform company, I was curious as to how beneficial it is to be able to actually see your customers in person and talk about the entirety of the solution as well as the ability to sort of move up the organization, meaning moving from the CIO suite up to the CEO level? I was just wondering if you could just expand on that a little bit because I think you're in a little bit different position than some other software companies that maybe only sell into one buying center. Thanks. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Kirk. I have to tell you, one thing that did surprise me a little bit during the whole virtual environment is CEOs were looking for a good conversation. So we were able to participate in those conversations then, which is obviously helping us now. And we were also able to bring large-scale management team gatherings with our team and their team, so we did good. But now that we're opening up, we should do even better. So I looked at my calendar for the year, I'll catch my family here and there on a weekend because I'm leaving Sunday for Europe, and after that tour of Europe, we'll hitting Asia very, very soon after that. So we're going full speed, open up the company. We're doing these knowledge events in four distinct locations, as I mentioned. Our sellers are going out on the street, and our management and going out on the street because that's where the customers are. And never forget that United Airlines commercial, when a guy walks in, he's got a bunch of envelopes and looks at his management team. We were sitting around the table, gauging it themselves and it goes, let's go visit some customers. So I expect we're going to get a lot of tailwinds out of that because you're right, to build trust with net new logos, it happens in person. It's hard to do that in a digital format. To really expand the relationship to an enterprise scale, it really does require a good meeting of the minds and emotional trust, and we'll do that. So I really think this is going to be another step function improvement in ServiceNow's future because as a platform provider, getting our customers healthy through some of the challenges that they're fighting through is a seminal moment in our history, and I'm excited. Kirk Materne : Sounds good. Thanks very much. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much. Appreciate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke : Hey thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about how you're seeing the new impact program roll out to your customers. And clearly, Bill, you talked a lot about some of the new products you're innovating on and delivering a lot of value to customers. But how are you just kind of treading that line between the base increases on existing products versus the new products that you're delivering and making sure that customers are able to take on the scope of new products where you guys are really innovating on? Thank you. Bill McDermott : Absolutely. I really appreciate the question. So here's the situation. Our customers need help. The impact part of this equation, think of it much more in the value delivery context than any kind of price increase. It's really accelerating the value realization for the customer against the software that they've already invested in and they want to extract as much business impact as they possibly can.  And for too long, these customer relationships across every company you can think of is managed by a deck at a point of sale, and then ultimately, the sale is made and then the consultants come in. But it's kind of like job changes, people do different things, and a year later, someone's saying, \"Hey, how did we do with that implementation again? Did we get what we bargained for?\" And what we're basically doing is making sure that they do and that there's a professional format in doing that. And not just with ServiceNow, but also for our great partners. So just think of this concept as the NOW platform in ServiceNow is the place where every conversation takes place between the partner, the customer and ServiceNow. There's no e-mails, there's no texts, there's no chat on the side. It's all on one platform with everything detailed and spelled out, and we measure everything in real time with all the analytics and all the business outcomes spilled out in a way that could be presented to any Board of Directors. So also on the pricing, again, I want to be clear, like we're not looking to make up for inflationary pressures by putting it on the customer. There are many new customers. There are many more logos. There are many more expansions to our platform. All we want to make sure of is that we do things highly professional, and we know the ranges where our professional expertise should be valued at.  And in that valuing and in that business impact to the customer, a fair agreement is reached. We even developed a pricing structure that enables customers to partner with us and look at the enterprise value of doing things with ServiceNow, not just 1 departmental value. And I think that whole idea of being a solutions and business impact platform company is resonating big time internally and externally. And incidentally, if you're interested, we've done more than 100 deals right now on ServiceNow Impact. And what we're seeing is user adoption is speeding up, values being accelerated and customer Net Promoter and satisfaction is going through the moon. And as Gina said, the retention rates prove it that it's best in the business. Operator : We have time for one last question. Your last question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Fantastic. Thanks. So much for fit me in. What a fabulous start to the year guys. Congrats to you. Bill, I really wanted to ask about the new automation engine as part of the San Diego release. Can you remind us of your vision for RPA, what the interest level is and maybe the extent to which these are competitive stand-alone opportunities or more filling in the gaps of workflows that naturally are found on the NOW platform? Bill McDermott : No, it's a really great question, Brad. Thank you very much. As you know, this idea of hyper automation workflows on the NOW platform means a lot to our existing customers. So what they expect from ServiceNow is to remain that highly innovative unicorn that we have been, one that organically builds better, more substantial product experiences with every passing day. And in some cases, they want us to integrate with other tools in the marketplace. But in other cases, if we can build it and it's all integrated into the NOW platform, they would like ServiceNow to own all of that, and we give them choice. And what you see here in this latest release, we brought together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience. And now customers are going to be quickly innovating and improving the way work flows across the enterprise.  So our job is to be helpful and integrate with all the market participants, especially when customers find that pleasing, but we also need to innovate ourselves and continue to build out this platform story in a way that's super compelling and it's generational. And that's why I said when I first came to ServiceNow, organic is delicious. Brad Zelnick : Awesome Bill. Thank you, look forward to seeing you out in Vegas next month. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Thank you very much. I look forward to spend some time together, Brad. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Brad. Operator : And this is all the time we have for questions. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank joining. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn today's call over to Darren Yip, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir. Darren Yip : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining ServiceNow's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2022. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, such as our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2021 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures, in addition to and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. ServiceNow's Q2 results once again beat expectations on the top line and the bottom line. Revenue growth was 29.5% at constant currency. Operating margin was 23%. Both results were above our guidance for the quarter. Our 99% renewal rate remains the industry's benchmark. We had 54 deals over $1 million. Our 27% constant currency cRPO growth is also strong. And looking forward for a moment, once you factor the large renewal cohort effect in Q3, our full year cRPO outlook is also strong. Like other premier technology companies we are managing through the current macro. As you'll hear from Gina, we're simply returning to the outlook we originally set for you in January of this year on a constant currency basis. Unlike others, while the currency effect also applies pressure on our margin, ServiceNow will maintain our full year margin guidance of 25%. We will absorb the impact through disciplined cost management, as we run more efficiently on the ServiceNow platform. Looking beyond 2022, our confidence in our midterm aspirations, which we raised earlier this year to $11 billion plus by 2024 and $16 billion plus by 2026, is rock solid. In short, ServiceNow's iron-clad fundamentals will not waver. The secular digital transformation tailwinds are blowing stronger than the macro crosswinds. ServiceNow generates an unmatched combination of organic growth and profitability at scale. We believe there is a generational value creation opportunity here on every level of our company. Therefore, we are hiring, expanding and investing for the future. Growth companies don't get stronger than this one. Before I hand things over to Gina, let me offer some additional color to underscore the state of the business. Enterprise software is an all-weather industry. Some businesses out there are prioritizing enhanced productivity to lower costs. Others are evolving business models to stimulate growth. All of them know full well that digital technology is the only answer. That's why the demand environment to software is consistent and durable. Market research from IDC and several prestigious institutions on this call I might add have all affirmed the stability of technology budgets. We also see consolidation of enterprise software as buyers shift further away from experimentation with unsustainable solutions. So when you think about the technology sector they're on niche vendors, legacy leaders and platforms. ServiceNow is a platform company with strong demand in a fast-changing world. And this is consistent with what we see from our customers. It's all about reprioritization. Customers are making significant investments with fewer platforms to drive faster ROI. As this process unfolds, while sales cycles can deal sizes get bigger as more materials are negotiated into those agreements. And we at ServiceNow are on the right side of the great reprioritization. One customer sum things up well. She said, \u201cWe have a capacity challenge. Not the ServiceNow, but for all the others that want to be like ServiceNow. It's time to standardize on the platforms we trust for the long haul.\u201d The current macro environment likely will need overnight neither will the theme for automation as companies need to make money, save money and differentiate and they need to do all of that really fast. Time has become the greatest asset of business. When you look at our results and our opportunity, it's clear evidence that digital transformation is the only way forward. ServiceNow is helping our customers innovate to win. Our ability to execute is another key point of confidence. This is a proven team. And what's happening here is about more than great business results. It's about honoring Fred Luddy's founding vision to change the paradigm of enterprise software. That's why from a technology perspective, ServiceNow has maintained a fully integrated workflow automation platform that gives everyone the great experiences they deserve. With artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, process mining and low-code capabilities all embedded in our architecture, we make hyperautomation about people. With 750 million net new applications being built on the horizon, ServiceNow is leading the low-code revolution our Born in the Cloud suite of applications stretches across the enterprise end to end. And all of our businesses are performing extremely well. In Q2 ITSM was in 12 of the top 20 deals with seven deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 13 of the top 20 nine deals over $1 million. Customer Workflows was in 14 of the top 20. Employee Workflows 13 of the top 20. And Creator Workflows was in a remarkable 20 of the top 20. World-class brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Banco Bradesco, Virgin Media, Ireland and CDW are some of the many selecting or expanding on ServiceNow. Adobe Works with ServiceNow to transform the way it serves employees, driving 30% faster care resolutions for everyday requests. NTT Data works with ServiceNow to generate end-to-end visibility of their ESG performance and they also provide ServiceNow's ESG solution to their own customers. Same Hawaiian works with ServiceNow to streamline its end-to-end procurement operations. Frankly ServiceNow has become the platform for digital business. And looking at SaaS businesses across the industry that have built $200 million or greater in ACV businesses, it's important to call out that ServiceNow is actually accomplished that milestone with 11 businesses in our current portfolio. And several of these businesses achieved that $200 million-plus figure faster than many prominent publicly traded software companies. So we see countless opportunities to build on this with expansion into additional adjacencies. And most of these adjacencies will be built on our platform like you're seeing with ERP workflows. Others might operate as integrated portfolio businesses that benefit from our strong installed base across the Global 2000. And one example here is Lightstep, which is delivering observability and incident response to some of the world's most innovative companies. Overall ServiceNow is hitting its stride as a platform, as a business architecture and as a commercialization engine. And next up is our Tokyo platform release coming in September. I'm heading to Tokyo personally and this will be a major milestone in our growing commitment to the Japan market and our pursuit of our annual objectives. The final point I'd like to stretch -- stress is this fast-expanding ServiceNow ecosystem. This is happening with some of our most strategic partners. Through our partnership with Microsoft, our technology workflows to help customers streamline the migration of existing workloads to Azure. This is opening additional addressable market to ServiceNow by creating an expanded cost-on motion with Microsoft enterprise sales and public sector teams. This is about incremental net new revenue growth. We are not opportunity constrained. The need for digital transformation continues to grow and enterprise software remains a defining deflationary force in this marketplace. The ecosystem effect also applies to the talent marketplace. There's a massive opportunity to talented professionals who aspire to build their future on ServiceNow. And as an employer, while others in the tech industry are slowing or even stopping hiring ServiceNow is hiring. We are hiring. We are doubling down on our talent brand. And that's a reflection of our deep belief and the amazing potential of this company. Our customers and partners are also expanding their ServiceNow workforces at a record clip which is another indication of the expansive cross enterprise adoption we are seeing for the ServiceNow platform. Finally, ServiceNow's impact solution is a critical piece of our ecosystem strategy. We are setting a new standard with respect to fast deployment and value realization. The faster we implement, the more we expand the use of the platform. It all adds up to a virtual cycle for stakeholders and the ServiceNow. In closing, we are confronting reality, but not conforming to it. Our Q2 beat on the top line and the bottom line reinforces who we are. The digital transformation imperative will not shift to the sidelines. I would like to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for their continued trust and confidence in ServiceNow. We're proud to help you make the world work better for everyone. We will continue full speed on our growth journey to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We are resolute because now as ever the world works with ServiceNow. With that I'll hand things over to Gina. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. In Q2, we beat the high-end of both our constant currency subscription revenue growth and operating margin guidance while maintaining our best-in-class renewal rate at 99%. Our business remains strong. Our opportunity is greater than ever. However, as Bill highlighted, our customers are feeling the effects of the macro environment. So what are we doing? What ServiceNow always does. We're putting our customers front and center to deliver a great experience so they can retain their customers, to drive productivity so they can bend the curve on the bottom line, to reinvent their business model, so they can innovate to win and come out of this moment stronger than ever. We're continuing to invest in our powerful go-to-market and incredible R&D organization to drive future growth while keeping both hands on the wheel and being disciplined with spend. We're leaning into our people path our commitment to our amazing employees so they can do their best work and we can fulfill our purpose together. This is what the ServiceNow culture is all about. Turning to our Q2 results. Subscription revenues were $1.658 billion growing 29.5% year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an over 300 basis point acceleration in growth year-over-year. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO is approximately $5.75 billion representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. At the end of June, we started to see customers elevate larger spend decisions to the C-suite resulting in elongated deal cycle. We've already closed several of those deals in July. And as Bill noted, this access to the C-suite has resulted in even greater exposure to the capabilities of the Now Platform. Our renewal and net expansion rates remained very strong. Our renewal rate was 99% in Q2 for all regions demonstrating the resilience of our business. The Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We finished the quarter with 1,463 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. And our largest customers continue to expand with us. We have now more than 100 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV, up more than 50% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom led all other verticals growing net new ACV 100% year-over-year and our Better Together go-to-market positioning continue to resonate as we closed 54 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV with 16 of our top 20 deals containing five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 23%, one point above our guidance driven by operating efficiencies partially offset by FX headwinds. Our free cash flow margin was 16%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.4 billion in cash and investments. Together these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, let me give you some context as to how we're thinking about the months ahead. While our business remains resilient, we do expect the elongated deal cycles that we experienced in the last couple of weeks of June to persist for the remainder of the year. We have factored that into our updated guidance. Additionally, which I know is no surprise to any of you, we've continued to see an incremental strengthening of the US dollar resulting in further FX headwinds for the second half of the year. We expect the total FX impact to be a $220 million headwind for 2022 subscription revenues and a $180 million headwind for Q3 cRPO. We have a well-diversified customer base with over 80% of our business in large global enterprises. As a result, we expect to sustain our best-in-class renewal rates. Over 85% of our new business comes from existing customers, which drives our robust net expansion and predictable growth. We also continue to see a very strong pipeline at our recent Knowledge event, which some of you attended in Q2, we drove a 40% increase in pipeline year-over-year. We're confident that we're appropriately factoring in the macro trends as we see them today and will continue to be transparent as the remainder of the year unfolds. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. Primarily to reflect the incremental $87 million headwind we're seeing from FX since the end of March, we now expect subscription revenues between $6.915 billion and $6.925 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. That's 28% growth on a constant currency basis in line with the original outlook that we provided in January. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect an operating margin of 25%, as we currently plan to offset an approximate one point impact from FX with operational efficiencies and disciplined spend management. We will continue to monitor FX rates over the next couple of quarters. We now expect free cash flow margin of 30%, reflecting slightly lower collection as we expect to provide greater payment flexibility to support our customers when they need us most in this current environment. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $203 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.755 billion representing 23% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 450 basis point FX headwind. On a constant currency basis, we expect subscription revenue growth to be approximately 27.5%. We expect cRPO growth of 20% year-over-year or 23.5% on a constant currency basis. As I've discussed in prior quarters, this reflects about two points of headwind and due to our larger than average customer cohort that renews in Q4. Excluding this headwind, our constant currency cRPO growth would be 25.5%. We expect an operating margin of 25%, and we expect $23 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. Finally, we remain very confident in achieving our 2024 and 2026 subscription revenue target of $11 billion plus and $16 billion plus that we provided at our Analyst Day in May. Our long-term trajectory has not changed. In conclusion, ServiceNow has established itself as an enduring platform. Our execution is proven and we continue to lean into our great opportunity with operational rigor. We're accelerating our development cycles with our September Tokyo release, to launch the powerful new products that our customers need now. We're doubling down and expanding our go-to-market programs for customers, including our top 250 key accounts to help them recognize value with greater business agility. We're being prudent with OpEx, but remain bullish on hiring go-to-market resources and the critical innovation roles necessary for future growth. And as always we will remain disciplined, as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. These actions will enable ServiceNow to continue delivering strong growth and profitability on our way towards our future targets. We remain ever confident in our journey towards becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world, for their incredible dedication and commitment. It's your relentless focus on our customers' needs that makes us ServiceNow strong. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-session will be conducted electronically [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I had a question for Bill. You talked about how deal sizes are becoming larger although, there are some delays in sales cycles in certain segments of the market. Can you talk about the flip side coming out of these elongated deal cycles, what are the positive consequences for ServiceNow, as these deals become potentially larger? And one for you Gina, you said that while the Q3 cRPO growth expectations have been reined in, it does look like the burden of cRPO performance shifts to Q4. Can you talk a little bit about how you sort of implied that you're keeping the year cRPO relatively unchanged, which means that Q4 is when we see the reacceleration? Can you talk about the dynamics there from the quarter-to-quarter perspective? Thank you so much. Gina Mastantuono : Sure Kash. I'll take the cRPO question first. And if you remember, we've been talking about this for several quarters now that with the renewal cohort that Q3 was going to be the bottom, right? So if you think about a renewal of $1 million at the end of Q4. At the end of Q1, if it comes $750,000; end of Q2 $500,000; and of Q3 only $250,000 it will pop back up in Q4. And so Q3 is absolutely the bottom of that renewal cohort and we'll see that reacceleration as we move into Q4. Bill McDermott : And Kash on the deal sizes, what you're seeing in certain cases is lengthening deal cycles because I call this the great reprioritization where C-level executives are now looking at their business and they're saying, what are the platforms that we will team up with for the next decade? And they are prioritizing that list along the lines of which platforms make me more productive or I can do a lot more with less because the work isn't going away even though you might have less people doing it. The second aspect is, how do I grow? And what channels will I need to innovate in to grow my business? And then finally, how do I differentiate against competition? Every industry has that marquee company that seems to be out front. And lots of times companies either playing catch up or they simply want to have a different level of secret sauce, so they can do something their competitor isn't doing. On all those dimensions, we're now seeing the ServiceNow platform chosen by especially the Global 2000 and that differentiation platform to really get business going either to save money or make money or compete better. And that is big because now we're not talking about a nice-to-have on the employee experience or better customer service management or even low code. We're talking about making that amazing platform the business platform for digital transformation for the world's largest companies. And I think Gina pointed out the $10 million and above growing at 50% year-over-year. So even as you might need to wait a little bit longer in certain cases, when you do it just gets bigger. And Kash, I think this is now the moment where ServiceNow really gets a big, big tailwind from a macro that forces customers to really think deeply about where they're spending their money. And they're not interested in long drawn out projects that might take multiyear to get there. They have to perform for the capital market now. So, we are bringing a calling card with the fastest ROI in the enterprise hard stock. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Thanks so much Bill for the bold and confident message. Thanks so much. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much Kash. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Kash. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Gina with the large Q4 renewal cohort coming up. Is there any argument to try and get some of these deals done early perhaps before the backdrop deteriorates further? And I imagine where inflation stands right now, customers might be only too glad to lock in pricing. Is that part of the strategy? And just maybe a follow-up as well for Bill. Bill everyone knows the environment has changed and I think we appreciate why ServiceNow is only more important. But, how do you distinguish environment first execution at times like these? And how do you feel your field organization is performing during these uncertain times? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, Brad. I'll take that the renewal cohort. So, what I'll point to is our continued best-in-class renewal rates. Q3 at 99% across the board in every geography during this macro environment, gives me much confidence that the renewal cohort is solid, right? And so, sometimes we renew early, sometimes we don't. We are having conversations always with our customers to lean in to what they're trying to do and how we can help them back. I really tried to bring that together in the script by talking about how ServiceNow is focused always on the customer first, and we will absolutely continue to do that, and we'll meet our customers where they are always. Bill McDermott : Brad, it's a great question, and I'll give you a little feel for how confident I am in the field organization. Now first of all, Kevin Haverty, who ran the field organization for over a decade as you know, is still on the executive management team and putting special focus on public sector. Paul Smith, who is an industry veterans running global sales, and he has a very experienced team and a tenured team in Europe, in Asia Pacific and Japan, and of course in the Americas, with our most tenured sales executive, who hits every quarter. So, we have a really, really excellent team on the field. We also have a very diligent attention to detail as we run the business on the ServiceNow platform. That's why we can run so efficiently. And I actually have something we call the CEO of digital dashboard and I have a complete purview on the pipelines across the world. And if you look at them year-over-year, our coverage is better now than it was last year geographically and by industry and by persona. I'm very comfortable with where we're at. And of course, I'm very comfortable with our ability to execute. Furthermore, I just want to give you some transparency on the coverage model. We're doubling down on tiring, as I mentioned. We will have a full capacity to achieve our 23 objectives at the Q4 mark. So, please know that we're covered and that actually intensifies along the lines of each month and this year to actually expand furthermore in our indirect or our digital sales effort. We're doing some very unique things there to not only cover existing, but also to get net new logos. And I did in the midst of the script did mention the Microsoft Azure arrangement where we can actually take advantage of customers that are moving to the cloud and taking advantage of a hyperscaler that's doing very well in the enterprise that's also teaming their sales force up with our sales force to cover net new revenue growth opportunity. This can happen at the IL-5 level. It could happen at the sovereign government level and it can also just happen in net new logos, where our strong market-leading ITSM solution can get many new customers to ServiceNow. It's good for Microsoft. It's good for ServiceNow. And I think it's also a tailwind that isn't really factored into our numbers. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, Can you Bill, I guess the platform message and that's what we hear in the market as well. Can you speak a little bit to the components? And I'm specifically wondering if I look at your slides the customer and employee workflow this quarter in terms of contribution was slightly lower than in other quarters. Is that a thing that is not quite as strategic or built out as the others and that's why there's something going on there, or maybe speak to that if something else what's happened there. Bill McDermott : Yeah. Thank you very much Raimo I appreciate it. You don't read anything into the perhaps somewhat lumpy details on one workflow versus another in any given quarter. Employee experience is actually gaining momentum and we have a fantastic General Manager of that business who's been with us for many years along with our well-known great leader of engineering CJ it's Blake McConnell I'm talking about. And he's got a great team. We just leveled all of our product reviews about 10 days ago and the prospects in employee and customer is fantastic. We have John Ball, Jon Sigler two industry veterans at the platform and the customer service level, all those businesses are going to be absolutely fantastic. So don't look for one quarter or another to make any inferences. I think the employee experience in a world where headcount is going to be incredibly important as companies decide on their hiring case. They're going to need to create great experiences. They're going to need to aggregate all the services in one portal to give those employees the most productive, futuristic user experience possible to give them all their training and needs and make sure that they're serviced properly. On the customer service side, I just think what we're doing there on the mid and the back office to make the engagement layer come to life is extraordinary. So I really pumped up about us as a platform company. And I think the bigger thing you should read into it is companies now as they go through the great REIT prioritization on looking at things they used to do in the 20th century which is to double click and that's a lot. And how quickly do I realize the benefits from that? And is there a way using the ServiceNow enterprise workflow automation platform that, I can leverage my processes give people a great UI but also get business outcomes faster. And when I say faster, I mean, some of the conversations are in quarter or within half a year. And therefore, I think a lot of pressure would be on companies that tend to take a long time to get the value. The other thing which is new that came up very recently but it's happening. It is companies that are in point solution where the customer says, \"I like RPA or I might like process this or AI that.\" You're basically saying look, are they going to be on my team 10 years from now at the platform. And a lot of them are starting to consolidate those point solutions into the Now Platform and you guys got that covered. And they're getting good economies of scale from ServiceNow when they do that. So again, all of that is new developments where I actually think a macro could lead to a tailwind that's not in the numbers. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Bill McDermott : You\u2019re welcome. Raimo. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. Tyler Radke : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we just go back to the specifics in terms of the deal slippage in the quarter? Was it a handful of large customers? Are these deals just now taking place in Q4? And then Gina just help us understand your assumptions you've made around close rates in the overall environment. Are you assuming that kind of the operating environment in Q2 holds for Q3 and Q4? Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Sure, great. Tyler sorry about that. So, yes, if you think about the elongated deal cycles, I want to be really clear and transparent as I always try to be with you on how we're thinking about the back half. And so we're assuming that we'll have similar trends through Q3 and Q4 on close rates and elongated deal cycles. What we also are trying to emphasize is that the deals aren't going away, right? They're elongated but many of the deals that were elongated in Q2 have already closed in July. And so those digital transformation tailwinds that we talked about the platform relevancy that we continue to talk about is very relevant and as relevant as ever which is why we felt very confident in reasserting our mid and long-term guide of $11 billion by 2024 and $16 billion by 2026. And so close rate we are taking into account the macro environment that we see in place today. Our customers were leaning in more than ever with our customers and we feel good about our revised guidance that we're taking into account everything that we're seeing in the marketplace today. Bill McDermott : Yes. And I think if you really look at it Tyler I mean FX side, we always said no one is outrunning the strength of the dollar in this environment and that was pression of course because you've seen that play out in the market. And we also acknowledge that especially in theaters of operation that are more affected by the macro. You'll see a lengthening of the cycle because, especially in markets that have grown accustomed to doing things a certain way. Now, they're in the great reprioritization. There is a time equation there. But there's also an expansion of the power of our platform that's not factored into the numbers and we'll have to see how that plays out in the back half. But what I can tell you is we have a plan. We have a very carefully thought-through plan to actually not only get the deals that may not have come in at the time we wanted them but they come in. But we also have a plan to expedite the ROI conversation at the point of discussion versus the point of proposal to get to the close earlier so companies can factor a larger scale relationship with ServiceNow in. Many of them can't even believe how quickly we can get them to value because they may not be as aware for example of ServiceNow in Frankfurt as they might be in New York City. So, we're making sure that we're bringing all dimensions of fast ROI critical thinking and industry solution-based by persona and dynamite execution in each geo not only with ServiceNow, but also with our partners to deliver that business impact. And what's changed in the environment? You didn't have to have so much on business impact when digital transformation was all the rage you could land and just expand. Now, I think you have to have that conversation especially in the larger transaction and we're very, very well-equipped to do that. Tyler Radke : All right. Sounds like you did -- on the road. Thanks a lot. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Tyler. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Tyler. Operator : We'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One for you Bill and one for Gina, Bill obviously you've operated in the software industry for multiple years and seen multiple difference through global crisis. I wonder if you could compare and contrast what you're hearing from the executives that you speak to year-to-date versus let's say the beginning of COVID European debt crisis global financial prices what are you going compare-contrast, what you heard from executives during those periods versus now maybe even sort of the KPIs that you're seeing in this business versus past businesses? And then, Gina just a follow-up on the sales productivity side, obviously sales productivity to your point remains high. You also grew sales and marketing headcount 26%. Last quarter you expected to grow headcount in the high-20s. Does that still hold? Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : So I'll take the second part first. And then, I'll pass it over to Bill. So sales productivity remains strong and is better this year than even last year. And so we expect that to hold, Phil and I feel really good about where we're leaning. We certainly have continued to hire feet-on-the-street go-to-market. We're continuing to invest. We are not pulling back at all, on feet-on-the-street hiring. And so we absolutely expect to continue to see similar pace in the back half as we continue to hire quota-bearing sales? Bill McDermott : And Phil, just on the idea of the global financial crisis and COVID comparing that to this current environment they're all a little bit different, but the one thing that they all have in common is they were absolutely an Elixir for cloud computing. So if you think about the global financial crisis, Phil you remember, I was working with a different software company at that time. And I tell the story in that September quarter how I saw a \u20ac1 billion disappears in a day. So it was very sudden. This hasn't been a sudden. And actually COVID evolved a little less suddenly as well. But that was the moment where everything moved to the cloud. Remember, everything became OpEx. All budgets were controlled by the line of business executive. Well now, as you got through the global financial crisis and cloud computing, became the pervasive computing theme of the 21st century, cloud as would got you, through COVID because everybody had to work virtually and you had to enable productivity in a completely digital world because nobody was doing business in person. Again, cloud got you through it. And this one here what you're going to see is cloud just gets reinforced. And I've always said that the infrastructure moves to the cloud, the hyperscalers will all do great in this environment. And then there's only a couple of other SaaS platforms that matter. And while it may be a little bit lumpier in a macro that's reprioritizing things, those five platforms that have been defined by the marketplace will I believe do extremely well in this environment. And it will be yet another proof point that it's all about the cloud. Phil Winslow : Awesome. Thanks guys. Best of luck. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Phil. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Phil. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Turrin : Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate you take my question. Gina, on the free cash flow side clearly you have the luxury of leaning into margin if growth is seeing impacts. You did mention just a minor step down on the margin you're expecting there tactic collections. Somewhat of a similar question on getting on the other metrics, just wondering if there's anything you can add to put some context behind that, whether it's a certain industry or something you're seeing and then confidence you have the ability to use free cash flow to offset any moderation you're seeing for the rest of the year I think is very top of mind for investors. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Yes, sure. So, listen, I think you're absolutely right and we have the flexibility and the ability, given our best-in-class margin structure to be able to lean in with our customers here, right? And so, I want to be clear, it's slightly lower collections, as we think about assisting our customers. And as you think about industries that probably have a little bit of cash flow or built up working capital, given the supply chain constraints, right? So those are the industries that you would expect to see us leaning in with here. But again it's a small impact to our free cash flow margin that, from our perspective, makes complete sense and it's really purely just timing. There's no concerns with respect to any bad debt assumptions or anything like that. It's just about allowing for and leading into a little bit longer payment terms, given the current macro environment. And so, real strength here. It's all about being proactive and working with our customers. Michael Turrin : It's helpful. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Yes. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Gina, I think this one is for you and two for you. I think, Kash was trying to put some words in your mouth and talking about sort of no change in the CRP outlook for Q4. I wanted to ask you that question directly. Like are you guys adjusting your view on sort of the cRPO growth that you're exiting Q4 with? And any chance that you give us that number, so we have more of a sort of a perspective on sort of how we're entering calendar 2023? Gina Mastantuono : So, I think, Keith, listen, I'm not guiding to Q4 now. But what I wanted to make the point and I think, what Kash was trying to allude to as well is, is Q3 the bottom when we think about that renewal cohort and how do we think about the back half, right? And so, you could imagine from our slight return to our January revenue guide that we are absolutely continuing. And I was very explicit in my script that we're factoring in throughout the back half of the year slightly longer deal cycles. And so, that will impact Q4 cRPO. But again just a timing perspective, right? Why we are also very confident in reiterating our mid and long-term goals of $11 billion by 2024 million and $16 billion by 2026. So I know you'd love to hear a Q4 guide. Give us a few more months and we'll give it to you then. Keith Weiss : I think all investors would love to hear Q4 guide, it\u2019s not just me. The other question I have for you Gina was on the operational. It sounds like it's not coming from headcount. It's not coming from slowing down hiring. Can you give us some visibility into where the additional operational efficiencies are going to come from in the back half? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So a couple of things. So we talked pretty explicitly about not slowing down hiring on feet-on-the-street go-to-market and on critical R&D resources, but we are being much more mindful and planful of other kind of support types of roles, as well as, if you think about T&E expense, event expense, marketing things, we're not cutting anything that's driving demand. Just being really smart and disciplined keeping the hands on the steering wheel making sure that we're being disciplined about cost, while really not touching our feet on the street or critical fingers on keyboards engineers. Bill McDermott : And Keith\u2026 Keith Weiss : Okay. Sorry, go ahead. Bill McDermott : Go ahead with your last question. Go ahead. Keith Weiss : No. I was just apologizing for cutting you off before. Bill McDermott : No, no Keith I don't want to miss your opportunity to get something. I just wanted to offer something to build on what Gina is saying like we never talk about this, but we've run the company on the ServiceNow platform. It's not an employee out of almost 20,000 people that know that we have anything, but to ServiceNow platform. So for example when you're hiring it's pretty nice to know in real time where the money is moving in terms of the market and what it takes to hire the best-in-class talent and how you can adjust the ratios of salary versus equity and these kinds of things. That for a large company can be millions and millions of dollars. It's pretty nice to run on a platform that's the leanest in terms of the G&A component of it in the industry. So there are many aspects of the ServiceNow platform that we're actually putting to work on the agility side for the savings that we're putting forward and managing operational excellence can hold our margin rate. And a lot of companies could never do that on the fly. So that's a very interesting observation. The second thing I just wanted to say like, just out of all respect for all shareholders like between love and respect our shareholders, you have no issues with this company on renewals and the cohort from Q3 to Q4. It follows the historical path. It's just that we never outlook that way. So why start now? But I think we should give you every confidence that the company is in great shape and you don't need to lose any sleep. Keith Weiss : Okay. Thank you, guys. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a clarification than a question. Gina the clarification is for you and I agree with the other Keith's comment that I think investors are candidly disappointed with the cRPO guide for September. And so when you say there'll be an increase for the December quarter do you mean from the from the 25.5 adjusted number or the 23.5 if you could just clarify what an increase the base level is. And then my question for Bill is something we talked about a few times over the last year. As sales cycles elongate the valuations of tech companies are declining continue to decline. And so how do you think about the ability to make M&A work on behalf of ServiceNow does increase your interest no change in strategy. If you could just update us on how you're thinking about the M&A opportunities as you look at the deal pipeline? Many thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Keith. On the clarification and I know everyone wanted to get a few for Board guide for me on cRPO. What I will say is that we expect it to reaccelerate from Q3 and we expect it to reaccelerate by at least two points because that's what the renewal cohort is impacting in Q3. Keith Bachman : Yes. Sorry, Gina just to push you but accelerate from what? What number are you referring to is what I'm trying to clarify? Gina Mastantuono : The 23.5. The 23.5 that is the constant currency guide for Q2 -- sorry for Q3 we expect Q4 to increase by at least two points from there. Keith Bachman : Okay. Okay. Many thanks. And then Bill for you? Bill McDermott : Yeah. So first of all on our capital allocation strategy, there is no change to the strategy at this time. The $11 billion plus and the $16 billion plus with regards to 2024 and 2026 respectively. As Gina said, we reinforced that that's based upon our current strategy and no change to it. I also would say that we have done tuck-ins and that's business as usual. One of them that is co-fired really is Hitchworks and we did that because the employee experience now matters more than ever. And managing employees and their capabilities to the productivity needs and the project needs that different companies are managing are really, really important priority now. So it's those kinds of things where it makes sense to one of our core platforms. It's what the customer wants. It's the tuck in. That's the kind of thing that we would look to do. I do acknowledge that you bring up a good point. We're in a very strong position when Gina gave you the cRPO with the RPO at $11.5 billion and the cash is $5.4 billion. We know that's only going to grow over time. So we're watching everything. But right now there's absolutely no change to the strategy. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you very much. Bill McDermott : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So kind of going on this path, I think one of the other things that candidly surprised people was just the rate of change and the pace of change in Q2. So maybe just help us understand when did these issues start showing up? I think you've alluded to certain verticals and certain geographies that may have been more impacted than others. And to the question, I guess, that was asked earlier Gina, if you think about the assumptions that you're making in terms of what you're seeing now in July for the rest of the year versus maybe what you saw in the quarter, are you assuming in some of the guide particularly for cRPO in the back half in worsening of trends as you start to see longer sales cycles on a larger cohort of bookings come to bear? And then just on the cash flow portion, I guess, is there an assumption in that 30% that there's a further deterioration or further I would say flexibility in terms of collections with certain clients, or are you already embedding some conservatism there? Gina Mastantuono : So I'll start with the forecast, right? And so we're not assuming a worsening trend in our cRPO guide from what we saw in the last couple of weeks of June. And so the rate of change when the issues start showing up, it was very late in the quarter and we are assuming similar assumptions in Q3 and Q4, so no worsening trends. In fact July looks strong. A lot of those deals have closed. And as Bill articulated some actually closed at a higher bill of materials than initially assumed. And so similar assumptions for Q3 and Q4 and this is after, Alex rigorous analysis of pipeline trends, rigorous analysis by industry. Coverage rate ratios look strong. And so very similar to what we saw in the last couple of weeks of June is our assumption and what we're seeing through July. On the free cash flow, the 30% includes the flexibility that I'm talking about. I do not expect further deterioration from that point. Bill McDermott : And Alex in our customer relationships, the relationship with the customers couldn't be better. If you live a customer set you look at Net Promoter Score, you look at the retention rate the Gina 99-plus. And it's absolutely the standard in the industry. And if you look at Q2 specifically and you say, where did you see what? As Gina has said, last couple of weeks of June, you saw some deals elongate their cycles based upon higher levels of authority having to approve them and you saw that more in Europe than you saw in other geographies. So that's it in a nutshell. And as it relates to the guide the guide like Gina has said assumes a continuation of that to ensure we had this level based on our customers dealing with their macro because that's what enterprise companies do. We serve them so they can serve their customers. And we factored that into the guide again, it's restoring the 2022 guide. We don't know FX is an issue across the industry. And we all know that we've heard our customers are dealing with a tougher macro that's in the numbers. I'm not worried at all about Gina's guide on the Q3 or the cohort conversation going into Q4. We're in great shape. We really are in great shape. So don't take waiting for it a little bit longer as any lack of strength. On the contrary, we're seeing signs that it's making us even stronger. Alex Zukin : Super clear. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Gina. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Alex. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Alex. Operator We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks for taking my question. ServiceNow has such a unique perspective across such a broad swath of different IT categories. I'm curious with the changing macro, if you're seeing any reprioritization within the categories whether it's IT or customer employee, custom apps anything you've noticed there? Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much Brad. There's no question that all of those dimensions are really super important. But this low-code revolution if you think about companies having to build 750 million net new applications in the next two years you have to say that that's one that we should do a call out on especially since we have the best low-code platform in the business. There's nobody that's going to back off on taking care of their customers and having a predictive way of managing their relationships with their customers and to make sure the promise that's made in the engagement layer can be kept in the full value chain of mid and back office operations. So, you deliver the right product at the right price point configurations in the right place at the right time. And then you service that customer and that account very carefully. Every company wants to do that. And I can tell you the employee experiences piece super, super important because you have to make every employee to have more productive. And then if you're not going to have the employee number that you expected because you have to deal with the macro you're going to have to apply automation. So I think this experience of the knowledge worker and how you enable them to work from any place and be extremely happy and productive, because you don't want them to turn over. And certainly you got to get it more out of each one, so you own automation. And I don't think any company will argue with that. And then on the IT side, I mean, it is the marquee jewel of our company and it just keeps chugging along and growing and growing and growing. And one of the areas that has really taken off is asset manager, because companies have to be very careful on how they manage their assets. They have to get all the value out of their assets. So they have to bring their assets in and they have to retire their assets, and they have to do that in a highly sustainable way, which is something that Gina have championed along with CJ for the company on ESG. And that's a really fast-growing business for us. And security operations, if you look at having all security operations on one pane of glass, because security is an issue at the C level in every company. And it's not because they haven't invested. They've invested so much in so many different things that they need one thing that can pull it all together, so they have visibility on an end-to-end basis to secure their operations and that's been just growing so, so fast for us. And I do want to give a shout out to Ben and Lightstep. I mean, the logos that they win is just on real. So when you think of observability and the areas that Lightstep and Ben are driving in the best brands in the world, the most innovative brands in the world is pretty compelling. And again, that's all part of our IT category. So they're all doing very, very well. Brad Sills : Great to hear. Thanks, Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much for the question, Brad. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, there's clearly been a lot of questions on what's causing the sales cycle and kind of where it's coming from. Maybe I'd ask it in a different way. When you look at your three core cohorts the G2K, the government and the commercial, could you just kind of give us a little compare contrasting across those three areas? And then since we're heading into the big government flush quarter in Q3. How do you feel about pipeline and close rates and spending behavior out of the Fed looking into the upcoming quarter? Bill McDermott : Yes. Thank you very much Derrick. As you know this is the time of the year for the government business couldn't be more confident. I could tell you couldn't possibly be more confident and what we're seeing in federal state and local. In terms of our commercial business, very, very good. And if you look at our industries, we're very bullish on all of them. And I'm also very -- I'm very happy that we put industries as a priority for CJ and the whole engineering team to link the industry domain expertise of great development in cloud services to the solution experts that actually interface with the account executive in comporting the best possible, road mapping and account plan for every customer we have including how our partners in ServiceNow deliver that impact of business value. That value chain has fully been realized in its structure and its execution and we actually expect now to start getting some real returns out of that in the back half and beyond. So, we're real strong on all the dimensions that you mentioned. And really, really can't be more confident. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add to that, the largest industries we play in if you think about financial services industry \u2013 energy, sorry, public sector federal telcom. These are all industries that holds up I know most resilient in these environments. And so, feel really good about the industry perspective. Said Q3 going into Q3 feel really strong. In particular, we had great results and impact even in Q2 in the Fed business. We saw really strong demand for that new solution. So as we're going into Q3, the federal team has ramped up and very excited. And so really across the board from an industry perspective federal, as well as the G2K very strong. Q \u2013 Derrick Wood : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Derrick Bill McDermott : Thank you, Derrick Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Reed [ph] with Bernstein. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for taking my call, One of the things that I think the business is been built on for so long has been a consistency and the ability to expand and you've talked about the elongating sales cycle, and you might be able to interpret that as putting a damper on expansion. But what I observe looking at your cohort chart is, that you've been able to attain right around 130% net expansion with some of your oldest cohorts actually growing quite strongly and well into the mid-120s. What are you seeing that is enabling even your cohorts that are a decade or longer old, to continue to have such consistency particularly in a situation like this, where they may be incredibly built out and it might be easier for them to push out or see less strategic benefit? What is enabling that consistency? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. A few things there. So first of all, you're absolutely correct, right? We talked about 99% renewal rates across the board in every geo in Q2. We're also seeing exactly, what you're seeing on expansion rates, remain extremely high even at our scale even with our customers who have been with us for so long. The reason for that Peter, is exactly what we're talking about. It's the breadth and scope of our incredible product portfolio, right? It's the expansion out of IT, into HR, into customer, into creator. It's about the platform evolution story. And that is more powerful today, than ever before. And so you'll continue to see similar levels of renewal, expansion rates as we continue to innovate, as we continue to make our platform stronger and better and more capable and as we continue to innovate where customers need us and want us to go. Bill McDermott : And Peter, one stat that may be interesting to you. Even where we have, as Gina has said, a great customer relationship and we're expanding along the lines of that platform, we're only 15% penetrated. So if you look at the product portfolio and the innovation that's come out of our engineering team, we in every count have so far to go against our bill and material to that road map. And all of that is upside in the Global 2000. And it also gives us permission to take it way beyond the Global 2000 as well, in our commercial business and our kind of inside selling business and some of the partnerships that we've built taking advantage of co-selling, with some of the bigger companies in the world will also be an interesting thing to keep an eye on. :  Thank you. Bill McDermott : You're welcome. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one last question. Our last question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Pat Walravens : Great. Thank you. So Bill, maybe to sum it all up here. How are you going to allocate your time over the rest of this year? What are your top one or two priorities? Bill McDermott : Yeah. Thank you very much, Pat. One of the things I said is I'll be in Japan as we do our Tokyo release. And I'm doing that because Japan is a major market and we intend to treat Japan as one of the most important regions in our company. And that's the world's third largest market as measured by GDP and we intend to do extremely well there. I'll also spend 2.5 weeks going across APJ. I'll be in Europe and obviously across the Americas. So I think the most important thing and I've made this very clear to our management team is to take it to The Street. So I will be taking it to The Street. After we're done with this we have an all hands meeting, where we'll talk to 19-plus thousand of our closest friends, around our great Board meeting and now our wonderful opportunity to talk to our investors and now it's all about the customers. So when we take this level of passion to The Street it's usually very good things happen. Pat Walravens : Great. Thank you very much both of you. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Pat. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Pat. Operator : And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Darren Yip, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Darren Yip : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our third quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call such as our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2021 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investment. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Darren, and I'll add my welcome to everyone joining today's call. ServiceNow had an outstanding third quarter. Looking at the top line results in constant currency, subscription revenue was 28.5% growth. cRPO growth was 25%. On profitability, operating margin was 26%. All three metrics are above our guidance, beating expectations once again. ServiceNow had 69 Q3 deals greater than $1 million. Our U.S. federal business had its best quarter ever in Q3. We saw strength across industries and business segments. Our performance was consistent globally with Europe executing especially well this quarter. Our renewal rate remains best-in-class at 98%. We are the largest organically grown enterprise software company. We have an unmatched combination of organic growth and profitability at scale. As these Q3 results demonstrate, we fully intend to maintain this leadership position. Regarding the operating environment, in recent quarters, we said that secular tailwinds were stronger than macro crosswinds. They are. Nothing we saw in Q3 changes this core thesis. Digital technology is a deflationary force. The enterprise digital transformation market is validated. The investment thesis is stronger than ever. Hybrid multi-cloud deployments, adoption of a modern data infrastructure stack, cybersecurity and risk management, AI and data analytics, remote work and collaboration, these trends are not only durable, their relevance is expanding. There'll be 750 million new applications built by 2025. In the U.S. alone, nearly 100 million workers will remain in hybrid environments. 27 billion connected devices will drive more data in cloud over the next three years. And ServiceNow's platform directly addresses all these challenges, which translates to numerous growth vectors for our business. I hear one thing from CEOs consistently. Anything we prioritize must generate results in weeks or months. This is the essence of the great reprioritization. In past decades, waves of enterprise systems were introduced to meet market challenges of those times, operating systems, databases, applications. What we see now is a generational shift from architectures built in the last century to platforms engineered for this one. If you look at the ERP market, we see customers at various stages of their move to the cloud. Some of the world's largest manufacturers, for example, are consolidating hundreds of old procurement processes into a modern workflow experience. This declutters the legacy environment, driving more than $1 billion in cost efficiencies for just one of our many ERP wins this quarter. We could do it because ServiceNow was born in the cloud. We integrate with everyone. We meet our customers wherever they are, any environment, any organizational structure, any operating model. Where there is complexity, we simplify. We are fast to deploy, fast to generate ROI. In this need for speed environment, the ServiceNow Platform is becoming the strategic center of gravity for our customers. In light of this, today, we're announcing a new initiative : RiseUp with ServiceNow to skill 1 million ServiceNow certified professionals by 2024. Our customers, partners and ServiceNow itself are all growing as ServiceNow workforces. We see opportunity everywhere. With RiseUp with ServiceNow, we'll give people the knowledge to seize it. Overall, the demand environment is strong. The market opportunity is growing. The ecosystem is expanding. ServiceNow is a growth company on every level. We see the growth across multiple buyer personas as customers consume more of our expanding solution portfolio. In Q3, both ITSM and ITOM were in 17 of our top 20 deals, with six deals each over $1 million. Security and risk were in 15 of the top 20 with five deals over $1 million. Customer and Employee Workflows were each in 12 of the top 20. Once again, we saw Creator Workflows in all the top 20 deals with nine deals over $1 million. Customers view ServiceNow as mission-critical. The Defense Logistics Agency works with ServiceNow to support the global defense supply chain with automated workflows. Faced with the crisis of Hurricane Ian, State of Florida worked with ServiceNow to deploy a mission-critical application to manage requests from people searching for their loved ones. In crisis situations, weeks to deploy isn't an option, which is why the State did it on ServiceNow in a few hours. Deutsche Telekom provided KPN works with ServiceNow to reduce their order management process from three days to under a minute, saving millions. Thank you. These stories are everywhere. In fact, one CEO chose ServiceNow for the first time said it best to me personally, \"It's always easier to make a strategic partner decision when you trust the people on the other side of it.\" In late September, we announced the ServiceNow Tokyo release. We delivered AI-powered task intelligence, which is all about making the customer service agents like more productive, reducing manual effort, speeding time to resolution and improving the customer experience. On the revenue-facing side, we delivered enhancements to order management, including support for bundling, configurable products and pricing models. We delivered major advances in field service operations and dispatch with scheduled optimization and territory planning. These capabilities help our customers better manage their costs but also their ESG footprint. At a moment when customer service is at the very top of C-level agenda, ServiceNow's net new innovation is driving and transforming the front office. The technology leaders, we released a new service operations workspace which will deliver faster incident resolutions to keep people highly productive. And given the ongoing migration to the cloud, we released a new licensed cloud cost simulator so leaders can model the cost benefits by moving from on-premise to cloud deployments. The Tokyo release contains many more new features across each of our major workflow businesses, technology, customer, employee and creator. It is the latest demonstration that ServiceNow's products and engineering machine is the best in the world, the best in class, like no other. And speaking of best-in-class, I've been lucky enough to learn from one of the greatest innovators at the 21st century. Fred Luddy and I have been on a multiyear journey together, one built on love and mutual respect. At this week's Board meeting, I was honored to take on the role of Chairman, with Fred remaining an active member of our Board for the long term. Fred remains the soul and inspiration of ServiceNow, and I'm honored to call him our founder and my personal friend. In conclusion, we again delivered on our promise in Q3. We said the company would continue its SaaS growth in any operating environment. We did. We said that cRPO growth would accelerate during H2. As our Q4 guidance reflects, it is. We said that we preserved the benchmark near the Rule of 60 for the full year and constant currency. We are on track. ServiceNow has a revenue growth, predictability of growth and sustainable business model. While others are managing the past, our engineers are innovating for the future. The fundamental question facing enterprises today is this : can modernization wait? With the robust demand environment we see, the answer is a compelling no, it cannot. The stated ambition of ServiceNow remains. We will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We are firmly committed to that journey. We are focused on value creation for our customers, our partners, our colleagues and our shareholders. Our confidence in Q4 extends to 2023 and beyond. Sales capacity and pipeline coverage are higher today than at any point this year. We have best-in-class sales and marketing efficiency. We have a highly differentiated platform. We have a business model that will be managed by design for net new innovation, growth and profitabilities you can count on. With this growth and margin profile, operating near the Rule of 60, ServiceNow is a unique asset and a premier company. We are hiring with an absolute focus on people who can innovate through code and who could sell solutions and who can help customers realize success. The bottom line is this. When our customers work, the world works better for everyone. That's why the world works with ServiceNow. If we didn't do what we do, it wouldn't get done. The hallmark for ServiceNow is net new innovation.  And with that in mind, I thank you so much, and I'll hand things over to Gina. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q3 was a fantastic quarter of execution. The team delivered strong results, beating all of our constant currency growth and operating margin guidance metrics, an outstanding performance across the board. Investments in digital transformation are a necessity, and ServiceNow remains a strategic priority. CEOs recognize that the Now Platform can deliver the workflow needs for their digital-first initiative while driving quick time to value and hard dollar savings. These outcomes are imperative in the current macro environment and while we continue to see robust demand for our products. In Q3, subscription revenues were $1.742 billion, growing 28.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.4 billion, representing 24.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.87 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis points beat versus our FX-adjusted guidance. 50 basis points of the beat was driven by early renewals from Q4 as the team looks to get ahead of our large renewal cohort. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98%, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We finished the quarter with 1,530 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. The number of customers paying us over $10 million in ACV grew 60% year-over-year as our cohort expansion remained healthy. From an industry perspective, net new ACV growth was led by retail and hospitality, up nearly 50%, followed by strength in education. Manufacturing had a good quarter as well, led by a large 8-digit deal, and technology, media and telecom continue to show durability. Federal had its best quarter ever, including an over $20 million net new ACV win. We closed 69 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including five with new logos. What's more, each of those five deals were led by a different product. That diversification showcases the breadth of our product portfolio and increasing customer awareness of ServiceNow's capabilities as a platform, which includes 11 organic businesses with over $200 million in ACV. In fact, 18 of our top 20 deals contained five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 26%, 1 point above our guidance, driven by our top line beat and operating efficiencies. Our free cash flow margin was 6%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.5 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro. Our ability to outperform in Q3 is a testament to the strong execution of the ServiceNow teams. Account executives are staying close to the customer, constantly checking in and proactively assembling the necessary materials to get deals across the line. We will operate with the same rigor in Q4 and are confident that we're factoring in the macro trends into our guidance. Consistent with the market on a year-over-year basis, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar also resulted in incremental FX headwind. We now expect a $290 million headwind to 2022 subscription revenue, a $330 million headwind to Q4 cRPO, 100 basis points headwind to operating margin, an approximate $160 million or 100 basis point headwind to free cash flow margin for 2022. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. We're revising our subscription revenues range to between $6.865 billion and $6.870 billion, representing a raise to our year-over-year constant currency growth outlook to 28.5% excluding a 550 basis point FX headwind. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect an operating margin of 25%, consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year as we are offsetting incremental FX headwinds with operational efficiencies and disciplined spend management. We now expect free cash flow margin of 29%, reflecting the incremental FX headwinds I previously noted. Despite the $160 million impact of FX, we will generate over $2.1 billion of free cash flow, demonstrating the incredible resilience of our business model.  Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 203 million. For  Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.834 billion and $1.839 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 600 basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 26% on a constant currency basis, excluding 600 basis points of FX headwind. We expect an operating margin of 26%, and we expect 204 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, we had a fantastic Q3. I'm so proud of our people for being focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. Bill and I would like to thank all of our employees around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. Our business is resilient, our teams are delivering, and we're as confident as ever about the future. We have the platform enterprises need to reinvent their business models and adapt to the new economy so they can innovate to win and come out of this moment stronger than ever. We continue to see a robust pipeline and are maintaining our investments in growth hires as the opportunity in front of us remains large. We're well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We go first this afternoon to Samad Samana at Jefferies. Samad Samana : Great to see strong results. Bill, maybe I'll start with you. You've been telling us, as you noted on the call that ServiceNow is going to grow durably regardless of the environment. I'm just wondering if maybe either the shape or the nature of the conversation that you're having with executives has changed in this type of environment, and how that's ultimately still allowing you to close all of these large deals and making this momentum? Bill McDermott : Yes. I think Gina said it very well, Samad, when she said we're mission-critical and the Now Platform has really become the standard for digital transformation in a modern enterprise today. And we're solving so many challenges. Our customers need to drive automation and productivity. As you know, they're either not hiring, they're laying people off and they have to do more with less. We're built for that. They need the computers and the platforms to do the work so that people have a more pleasant experience on the employee side, and they require an experience no matter where they're working from, that's world-class. We take care of that. The customer service management has evolved from just the engagement layer of how I market to you, sell you, cross-sell you. It's really moved into the mid-office and the back office and back into the supply chain on how I can streamline with great efficiency, giving you the right product and the right form factor and price on time just as you expected it. And that end-to-end is all about the ServiceNow platform. And finally, you're seeing a breakthrough here on building net new innovation. Customers are going to have to do that for themselves and with partners. And we are also going into a co-creation mode with our partners in every industry and geo around the world. That's pretty stunning, and there's lots of use cases and examples. The big thing, Samad, is that C-level executives are looking to ServiceNow. They are calling us. They want to work with us. They see that we're the defining one. And that took some time to build and I think we're there now. Samad Samana : Well, the growth is incredibly impressive. And Gina, maybe just a quick follow-up for you. On the comment around factoring macro, and can you maybe just help us understand, last quarter, you called out slightly longer deal cycles. Any change, can you just dimensionalize what you factored in from a macro perspective as it relates to maybe deal cycles or close rates? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, it's a great question. And certainly, we are not immune to the macro environment, and we're certainly not blind to what's happening around us. Our ability to execute despite the macro is quite astounding. And I give amazing kudos to our incredible sales organization around the world. We are staying closer to our customers than ever before, checking in with them, making sure we understand the levels of approval that they need to go through, making sure that we understand what they need to get that deal across the line. We will maintain that level of rigor that you've seen us do in Q3. And so while certainly, there's more outlook on deals that are getting closed and there's more -- people are looking at deals closer, but we are closing them. Close rates are stronger and we feel really good about how we put that all into our guidance. And so macro is evolving but our sales force is staying so close to our customers and really driving superb execution. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We go next now to Phil Winslow at Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Congrats on just an awesome quarter. Bill, one of the things that you mentioned during your comments was sales capacity has never been higher and never has, and the coverage ratio for the year has not been higher. This is even on the context of growing sales and marketing headcount 30%. My question to you is, this is one of the biggest net add quarters in terms of employees in sales and marketing this year and over the past couple of years. You usually don't see a lot of salespeople moving to a new company in Q3 but they're doing that to ServiceNow. When you talk to these new employees and your management team, what are they saying about why they're coming to ServiceNow? And then Gina, you talked about continuing to invest in go-to-market there. You obviously hit 30% growth in Q3. How should we think about the exit rate for this year? Bill McDermott : Well, Phil, thank you very much for your kind remarks and also the question. If you think about the first quarter of the year, the economies of the world really weren't shaking. Everything was going very well. And especially a tech company like ServiceNow, people were very desirous of having our people, too. But we still weathered that and we continued to hire. And obviously, the people that you hired in the second and the third quarter, the beauty of that is they're now becoming truly productive and certified to execute at a level that we would consider statistically relevant for moving the needle. And that's where I come with my max capacity. It's not just based on the number of people, but it's based upon their readiness to enter into the customer relationship with a level of proficiency so they can execute at a high level. That's what I'm talking about. And we're there now. And we're there stronger than we were all year long, Phil. So it's in absolute numbers. But it's also on readiness and it's in the pipeline and the coverage in the pipeline is better. So all those dials look great. In terms of why people come here, they come here for the culture. They know that this is all about net new innovation. It's all about customer centricity and brilliant execution and it's a politically fat-free environment. We just want to win, and people want to be a part of a winning organization. Gina Mastantuono : And then on your question on actual sales and marketing hire, Phil, yes. ServiceNow is hiring and will continue to hire and are investing for growth. So we are absolutely committed to continuing to build up our world-class go-to-market organization and it's all about driving long-term growth and ensuring that we also are continuing to drive ramp rep productivity. It's really about ensuring that the opportunity that we see in front of us, that our sales and go-to-market teams are ready to drive that growth that we continue to see. So you'll see us continue to grow our sales, quota-bearing especially. We'll also be hiring our critical engineering heads. We're very much open for hiring these critical growth hires. Bill McDermott : And one thing, Phil, I just don't want to fall between the cracks, is the 1 million in the RiseUp with ServiceNow campaign, where we're going to hire them. Some of them will end up getting hired here, of course, but we're going to train them for our customers, for our partners and to ServiceNow. So there's a bold move for 1 million ServiceNow-trained professionals to put them into the growth engine of ServiceNow. And that will be done on a global basis. We see bold moves that need to be taken in India, Japan, Korea and continued expansion in Europe. We just have a tireless appetite for growth. Operator : We go next now to Sterling Auty at MoffettNathanson. Sterling Auty : My question is, when you look at the large deal activity in the quarter and the pipeline, how much of that is actually replacing legacy architectures to save money in this tough budget environment we're heading into? And how much of it is about that automation to drive increased productivity? Bill McDermott : Thank you, Sterling. It's an interesting question. It's always important to reinforce that the 20th century architectures were heavily invested in by our customers. And our desire is not to replace them. Our desire is to make them more relevant so they deliver modern value and a highly agile and experience-oriented way for employees, customers and partners. So those underlying systems, some of them that are point solutions, and they never should have been there in the first place, they do disappear. The core large, well-known brand systems, they remain, but with the agility of the ServiceNow Platform above them and our ability to automate the workflows and completely change the experience set, we're now reinventing the way supply chains run for the biggest auto manufacturers in the world. We're now taking procurement management to an entirely new level of procurement and finance organizations for the biggest retailers, manufacturers, freight companies around the world. They were double-digit wins, doing this for some of the largest companies in the world. So they're taking out huge costs. They are getting rid of point solutions. They're keeping the main ones and then they're automating for speed and agility and value on the ServiceNow Platform. The business cases are unbelievable. It makes one ask, why are we so generous with our pricing? If they can get $1 billion, can't we get a little more? That's the situation we're in here. Operator : We'll go next now to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Bill, congratulations on the new Chairman position, and congratulations on a great quarter in a difficult environment. My question is actually for Gina. You guys did a tremendous job in driving operating margins. At the same time, you're hiring to plan, right? And you're still aggressively hiring. Can you, one, talk to us a little bit about where you're seeing the efficiencies and sort of where you're able to kind of drive that incremental productivity out of the entire ServiceNow? And two, I was wondering if you could touch on free cash flow a little bit. It has been getting more seasonal over the years. This is the lowest free cash flow margin we've seen in quite some time. Were there FX impacts? Was there increased seasonality? If you could just give us any kind of visibility in terms of what happened on that side of the equation. Gina Mastantuono : Yes, absolutely. Great question. So really proud of the fact that despite about 100 basis points of FX impact on our operating margins, we're able to hold them flat with our original guidance at the beginning of the year, while at the same time, still hiring for quota-bearing go-to-market fingers-on-keyboard engineers, right? And the efficiencies that we're seeing are across the board. So if you think about leverage in mid and back office G&A, leverage on the marketing side of things, if you think about really what our incredible cloud infrastructure team is able to drive with respect to efficiencies even in this macro environment, it's pretty remarkable. And so the other thing is that our platform drives efficiency for ourselves. We are the customer-zero for all of our new product innovation, so our platform enables those efficiencies across the board. So that's the other big lever that we always have to play here. So feel really great about the fact that we've been able to drive those efficiencies even through this current macro environment. With respect to free cash flow, absolutely. So Q3, in general, is a lower free cash flow period. We have our midyear bonus payout. We have bond interest payout. But we also have seen a pretty big FX impact in the quarter and for the remainder of the year. So we talked about 100 basis points impact on free cash flow margin that we're not able to absorb this year because truly the impact on collection happens all at once, whether the FX impact on your P&L because of the ratable way that we recognize revenue happens over a period of time. And so underlying health of free cash flow remains great. We're obviously, as we talked about, staying close to our customers and giving them some leeway on payment terms if they need it. But what I can tell you is that it's days as opposed to weeks. And so we are really staying close to the customers. The trajectory of free cash flow accretion over time remains the same. Keith Weiss : Got it. So it sounds like much more linearity and FX headwinds than any significant change in invoicing terms or payment terms? Gina Mastantuono : Exactly, exactly. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Matthew Hedberg : Great quarter. Bill, I had a question for you. You've made some previous advances in observability of Lightstep. In this quarter, you acquired Era Software, which looks like a great addition to the platform. Can you talk about sort of what the integration plans are there and sort of maybe refresh what this means for your broader observability efforts? Bill McDermott : Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much for the question, Matt. Basically, if you look at what we're trying to do here, we are bringing a scalable, cloud-native log management solution and database that complements Lightstep's existing solutions to the world. And this is really exemplifying and accelerating our vision, which is essentially to unify telemetry, logs, metrics and traces and now deliver that truly unified observability workflow on one platform. And this is going to take huge costs out of the equation, and it's going to bring a much greater experience to all users involved because they'll avoid the confusing context switches they have to do now. So all the integration work that is necessary is being done. It is all integrated back onto the Now Platform and there's a road map to do that. But right now, we're extremely happy with the way Ben is leading. Era Software just makes us stronger, and we're super excited about the future of this business and what it can be. It's going to be interesting to watch this thing play out. Operator : We go next now to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Bill, I don't think we've heard you say the words procurement and supply chain more often than you have on this earnings call. And I guess I want to dive into that because after seeing SAP's results, after what Oracle was talking about, it does feel like there's a -- there's like a deferred amount of activity that's getting done in the back office. And I just want to see your take on kind of participating in that activity as you're talking about that driving, it seems like, some pretty material wins in the quarter. And then I guess maybe a follow-up for Gina is around linearity in the quarter. And also if there's a way to quantify the federal business seems like it, again, had the best quarter ever. Just how much of that was upfront or kind of self-hosted revenue recognition? Bill McDermott : Alex, first of all, let me thank you for your question. You're right. There's quite a bit that has to be done in the back office to automate business processes for a new world order of things in the macro. So you're 100% right. It's still early days, but I see a massive opportunity, given how much enterprises spend on ERP today. And if you look at procurement and supplier life cycle management solutions that make it possible for customers to unify these transactional systems and enable them, through workflow capabilities, that truly drive efficiency. And the user experience and the consumer grade aspect of ServiceNow is really coming front and center because these transactional systems, they all work fine if you're a power user or a super user. But when you start to get more people collaboratively involved in a process, there's a demand now for consumer-grade UX. And there's nothing that works better than workflow automation to solve some of these problems. So we are providing a collaborative platform for all the stakeholders in an enterprise, and that consistent user experience is our superpower. And I do want to underscore, we are not interested or trying to replace the transactional systems of the brands that you mentioned. Those are wonderful companies and they do something that's very important. What we're responding to is the agility of the supply chain and how you can reorient it in record speed because that's what this world order is asking for, how you can rethink suppliers to manage different labor issues, whether it's in arbitrage or just buying from the people you should be based on your ESG efforts, or your MWBE spend and many other things that many customers care a lot about. ESG is a big thing. They're doing that all on the workflow automation context of ServiceNow. And they love the fact that we integrate with everybody, and we're not at war with anybody because we're on the side of the customer and that's what we should all be doing. Gina Mastantuono : And on your question, Alex, on linearity in the quarter, we actually had great linearity in Q3, our best ever. Really, really pleased with how the sales organization is, again, staying really close to the customers. Federal business had its best quarter ever this year in Q3 and outperformed. We had 16 deals over $1 million, one of which closed with over $20 million of net new ACV. Federal also saw great linearity in the quarter really because the platform is demonstrating such strong ROI that is really enabling them to get through the approval process faster. We're really seeing an increase in the volume of federal agencies that are really looking at their partnership with ServiceNow through an enterprise lens, right? So those deals are getting bigger, more strategic, more multiyear. And we're seeing cabinet-level agencies really trying to consolidate contracts at an enterprise level with us and standardize their spend on the Now Platform. So federal team just doing incredible work with their customers. With respect to hosted, we had about 3% this year -- sorry, this quarter, which is flat quarter-on-quarter but down 1% from last year Q3. And so really great linearity across the board. Hosted, flat quarter-over-quarter but down 1 point year-over-year, which is actually a headwind to that revenue growth, which means our revenue growth is even stronger. So really, really great results across the board. Operator : We take our next question now from Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Congratulations, and what a change from the Microsoft earnings conference call yesterday. Bill, I wanted to get your perspective. You talked about the great reprioritization. Microsoft talked about how some new cloud workloads are being paused by the customers and they're optimizing existing workloads. So I just wanted to see, what is it that is different about the prioritization of ServiceNow in the face of other headwinds that we're starting to hear about in the public cloud? And how does this position the company for '23 looking into a more uncertain time? We all thought we're going to have a recession in '22. We sort of escaped it. Maybe it happens in '23 or maybe it doesn't. The great reprioritization that you talked about, Bill, how are customers viewing the value proposition, return on investment on ServiceNow relative to the cost of capital? And Gina, if you could care, how would you be approaching calendar '23 guidance? Are you going to be more conservative than usual, given the rising environment that we all appreciate? Bill McDermott : Yes, Kash. Markets are very rational. Customers are extremely focused right now on productivity. They care a lot about their customers and their employees and obviously, their bottom lines. And no platform in the enterprise software industry gets them what they want faster, from creating great experiences for their employees. You can't give a customer a 3-star Michelin experience until you first energize your employees. So that's 1 aspect of it. They know they have to have more productive, happy people. The cost of turnover and problems in the workforce, it's a huge, huge bottom line hit that a lot of people don't factor into the equation. And a lot of it is caused by bad onboarding, bad systems and not really a great user experience for the people who work for their company from anywhere they want to be. And as it relates to the customer, I touched on that. I think what we're adding on customer service management right now with the completeness of our vision is stunning in terms of value creation and a big surprise to customers who didn't use to think of ServiceNow in that space and now they do. And as it relates to our core IT, I mean, we obviously believe -- not to go into great details on that, but they're blown away by the San Diego release in March and the Tokyo release in October. They know there's an immediate cycle from what they need and how quickly we can engineer it and get it into the release level. So the existing customers love that, that they have this incredible seamless experience with ServiceNow. They know the innovation is coming on time and at the highest level of quality. And finally, I think, and at a platform level, the need to speed, Kash, is everything. Getting these business cases rational, getting these customers up and running swiftly and demonstrating immediate business value is the essential ingredient. I didn't give you one example in the ERP world where we did not get these customers live in more than 100 days. So we're talking need for speed and we're talking ability to deliver and the customers are having great experiences. You can't find a customer in the global economy that doesn't love the platform. I keep trying, I still can't find them. Gina Mastantuono : And Kash, on your question with respect to 2023, obviously, we'll provide more details on 2023 in January. Overall, as you're hearing from our tone, the demand that we're seeing for the Now Platform has remained resilient and strong. FX, as you know, has become a significant headwind, particularly over the last three months. Since the beginning of this year, we now see about a $400 million headwind related to FX in 2023. And we certainly don't think the macro environment is, all of a sudden, going to change as we enter into 2023. So when we think about guidance, we'll be taking all of these factors into account, as you would expect us to. Operator : And we'll go next now to Brad Sills of Bank of America. Brad Sills : I wanted to ask about an update quickly on the SI channel. I think, Bill, in the past, you've said seven or eight of the top 10 global SIs with $1 billion-plus pipeline. That's just an astounding number when you think just a few years ago, that channel was almost non-existent. So just curious, how much of their productivity is contributing to your results here today? How do they give you that reach into these other departments that historically ServiceNow hasn't been and obviously, you're talking about ERP and back office, creator employee customer. You're seeing a ton of momentum there. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how important that channel is in bringing you into those types of opportunities and the traction you're seeing there. Bill McDermott : Brad, it's a great question. And look, it was very interesting in the early days just opening people's minds to the power of the Now Platform. And our global partner ecosystem is obviously a meaningful enabler. And they're critical for us to drive successful implementations for our customers and also to tailor our products to different industries. So this idea of co-creation, whether it's for an industry, it's for a sub-industry vertical and even at a micro-vertical level, we've only scratched the surface of what's possible with the ecosystem. We're young in terms of the runway for growth. As it relates to the top ones, we now have eight of the top 10 global advisory and systems integrators that have committed to a plan greater than $1 billion with ServiceNow. And again, I'm very open to the ecosystem. And that's why you see us making a bold move today on RiseUp with ServiceNow to scale 1 million. I know I undercalled it but it is what it is. I'm sure it will be 2 million because there's such demand for the platform. And I really want our partners to love and trust ServiceNow as we love and trust them because it really is about mutual goal setting. It's about making sure we're very clear about who's doing what, and we don't duplicate efforts and we never disappoint our partners. It's all about trust. And they like us because we're straight shooters here and we want to win and they want to win. And the other thing that's happening is they have -- like to Kash's point on the great reprioritization, there's going to be so much spend that will go around. But what they all realize now is business impact is what it's all about, especially in this macro. And then more and more reaching deep into the ServiceNow relationship because the customers won't listen to long, drawn-out expensive time-consuming multiyear projects. If that project isn't in the same calendar year, the likelihood of getting approved is real low. And if you remember, in 2008, that was the era where everyone moved away from CapEx to OpEx, and that was where the cloud got the big tailwind. Well, now you got half of them in the cloud so they're looking at OpEx. And that OpEx question is which platform can get me to the winning equation the fastest? And which platform is going to be around 10 years from now to be a dominant force in my infrastructure? And that's where ServiceNow seems to be answering the bell. Operator : We go next now to Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : I'll add my congrats on a fantastic quarter. So Bill, how broad are your ambitions in the Employee Workflows market? I believe you had crossed $500 million there. Some of your partners seem to have 20% or 30% of their pipeline in HR. And now you have this Hitch Works asset for talent intelligence and skills. So just curious how broad is that multiyear road map at this point. Bill McDermott : Yes, it's -- first of all, thank you for the question, Mark. It's really broad. If you look at Employee Workflows, they're 12 of our top 20 deals and we had seven deals greater than $1 million. And what we're helping customers do really is navigate this uncertainty that they're dealing with. And they've got to give these employees that they have, no matter where they work, a great experience. And it's not only limited to, I would say, recruiting, hiring, onboarding, training, certifying, providing all the services that the employee needs on one mobile app. And that includes off-boarding employees in a first-class way, which most companies forget to do, which really hurts their brand image. We care about all of that. But in addition to all of that, we're now in a world where customers are really pulling at us because they're like, \"Hey, I'm not going to have as many people. And I really got to think about reorienting my business processes or rethinking how I automate things that I just haven't gotten to yet but I need to do it quick.\" So our ambitions are always in the billions. And this is another business where we're in billions. And I think we're just getting started on the employee experience journey. And I'll tell you why. If you look at even ourselves, there isn't a single employee in this company that could tell you a single system of record that might be in the infrastructure somewhere in our cloud. They have no idea. But what they do know, like Gina said earlier, everything that they do is on a mobile application on their phone, and it says ServiceNow because we completely workflow automated the entire corporation. So they don't know anything else. And what we're constantly hearing is people want to join because their onboarding experience is so great. And we don't lose employees. We have gotten lots of employees joining here that literally bounced out of another company in a week because they couldn't stand the onboarding experience and said, \"This isn't for me.\" So everything having to do with the employee experience and the management experience. We launched in the Tokyo release a complete manager solution so we can manage their careers, their hierarchy of their training and development and they can also do that with their employees on the Now Platform. And all of this is happening in real time. So the system of record, again, we're not interested in being 1 of those, and we have no quarrel with any of them. We are interested in the experience and that's where the money is. Operator : We go next now to John DiFucci of Guggenheim. John DiFucci : Bill, we've done a lot of work on the U.S. government opportunity. And you and Gina both mentioned the record results there in this quarter. As you know, this is the fiscal fourth quarter for the government and likely the strongest spending quarter of the year for that customer or vertical, I guess, it's a vertical. But can you talk about the opportunity for any spillover into next quarter or even next year? Or is this really sort of a use or lose it mentality, something -- is that something you can avoid in this vertical so it's always going to be material just like a third quarter thing? Bill McDermott : Yes, John, thank you for the question. We have always been really strong in Federal. And a lot of that is driven by productivity, efficiency and government organizations. And I think we can all agree that, that's a big opportunity. So that area of focus for us has always been a priority. The budget there is large and there's a lot of demand for updating the technology environment for governments. What they love about ServiceNow is we integrate the things that they've already done. And we're not in a debate about whether the task was done properly or not. The customer can decide how they retire point solutions by the bundles, but we don't insist upon that. We are driving the experience. And I can tell you with great confidence, John, we have a very strong pipeline going into the fourth quarter with more multimillion-dollar deals, and I couldn't be prouder or more confident in our team. Operator : We go next now to Karl Keirstead of UBS. Karl Keirstead : I'll ask a quick one for Gina. Gina, did that pull-forward phenomenon that you cited in 3Q continue into the fourth quarter, such that it's shaping up to perhaps be a little bit more front-end loaded in terms of renewal timing than you would have expected? Gina Mastantuono : So I talked about the fact that one of the reasons why our cRPO beat in Q3 was related to 50 basis points of pull-forwards of Q4 renewals into Q3. And if you remember, on prior calls, I talked about the fact that this Q4 was a large renewal cohort because the fact that we were able to get some of them done early absolutely helped drive the RPO but also ramped our revenue beat as well. Expectation is that our Q4 renewal will be on par. We had 98% renewal rate in Q3. We expect similar levels in Q4, and so feel very good about the pace of renewals for the remainder of the year. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question this afternoon, and that will come from Michael Turits of KeyBanc. Michael Turits : Congrats on a good job. So maybe to continue on that vein. My understanding is the expectation for the cRPO increase was primarily predicated on renewals and at par as opposed to expansion. So maybe can you comment on how the expansions have been going both on the early renewals and the prospects for those that you expect to renew in 4Q? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Great question, Michael. Expansion rates, you know we don't give expansion rates anymore on a quarterly basis, but we reported last year expansion rates of 125%. And we've seen very strong similar expansion rates throughout 2022. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the ServiceNow Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I'd like to thank you all so much for joining us, and wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.",

At the time, I'll turn things over to Darren Yip, Vice President, Investor Relations. Darren, please go ahead. Darren Yip : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer.  During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, such as our guidance is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events.  Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings including our most recent 10-Q and 2021 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenue, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments.  To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill? William McDermott : Thank you, Darren, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today. ServiceNow continues to perform as-the-beyond expectations company. For Q4, we beat guidance with subscription revenue growth of 27.5% in constant currency. Operating margin was 28%, 2 points above our guidance. Our free cash flow margin was 30%, 1 point above our guidance. We had 126 deals greater than $1 million in Q4, including our largest deals ever worldwide in EMEA and in Latin America. Our 98% renewal rate remains the industry benchmark. With 25.5% constant currency cRPO growth, we actually had better-than-expected new business in Q4 with less reliance on early renewals. Based on this new business surge, we are giving a very strong guidance for 2023. Our guidance reflects a disciplined forecast that appropriately balances our well-founded optimism for ServiceNow's business. We'll work hard to go beyond it, and we'll begin that march in Q1.  Here is the main takeaway. Even in a complex operating environment, ServiceNow is executing at the rule of 58.5%. We are driving net new innovation, fast growth and operating leverage. ServiceNow is the proverbial safe harbor in all weather conditions. Let me unpack the current environment for you. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation aren't going anywhere. IDC's research makes a clear that technology budgets are growing. They forecast IT spend will grow 5% in 2023, software spend at 8% and Software-as-a-Service spend at 15%. So as businesses increase spend, the only question then is where will all that investment go? And this answer has everything to do with the great reprioritization. The theme in Davos this year was cooperation in a fragmented world. It all begins with a fragmented enterprise. C-level buyers don't want long-term road maps to clean up a siloed mess of point solutions. They want integration, speed, automation, great experiences and business impact. A CEO told me, \"We can't afford 1,000 points of dim light. We need a cohesive plan with a trusted platform.\" So this is now without any doubt, a platform economy. And only a few platforms will be relevant in this shift, and none are as well positioned at ServiceNow.  This begins with our business model. ServiceNow was born in the cloud, established itself in IT and expanded from that core. It accelerates with the realities of the multi-cloud world. Many enterprises are struggling to use public cloud capacity that they have already procured into ServiceNow, which directly enables cloud workload migration. We are the control tower for any architecture, public, hybrid or multi-cloud. And with open telemetry, we help business build and monitor cloud-native applications. This all extends to driving automation. ServiceNow has natively embedded the complete tool set from AI to RPA to process mining in our platform. Now professional developers and the rest of us, real people like you and me, can build mission-critical applications to automate the world of work. Everything culminates with real business outcomes.  ServiceNow integrates the enterprise to deliver better customer service, employee experiences, security, risk management and next-generation business processes like Procure to Pay, technology foundation, hyper automation, process orchestration. With this completeness of vision, ServiceNow is the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. If all we did was help existing customers consume everything this platform can do, we would stay a fast-growth company. But of course, our strategy goes well beyond this as does our proven ability to execute.  Right now, many technology companies are working to shift resources from bad businesses to good ones. ServiceNow only has good businesses. Our products and engineering team is building organic net new innovation with an unmatched level of speed and quality. When we started to sense noise in the macro early in 2022, we shifted immediately to a conservative cost management posture in running the company. This allowed us to focus on execution with our team rather than look to workforce actions to leverage. It also allowed us to continue hiring, especially in engineering and quota-carrying roles. The results tell the story. ITSM was in 14 of our top 20 deals, with 15 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 16 of the top 20, with 14 deals over $1 million. Security and Risk Solutions were at 13 of the top 20, with 9 deals over $1 million. Customer workflows were in 13 of the top 20, with 13 deals over $1 million. Employee workflows were 13 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million. And create workloads were in 19 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million.  We saw new business growth, new logos and major expansions with some of our existing customers. The United States Army expanded its ServiceNow road map well beyond IT. ServiceNow will improve the Army's ability to consolidate service management for its over 1 million active military contractor and civilian population. The Schwarz Group, one of the world's top retailers will digitize its 11,000 stores from retail locations to logistics on ServiceNow as its digital business platform. This transition is a transformation and it will position the Schwarz Group at the forefront of the next-generation retail industry. From Banco do Brasil, to AT&T, to Sumitomo, we have countless stories that span ServiceNow's workflows, Lightstep, geographic regions and industries across the board, we're winning. And as you'll hear from Gina, we grew new business 100% year-over-year across retail, hospitality, transportation and logistics. That's only one example. And with the expansion of ServiceNow's impact, we are setting the standard for speed of deployment and business value for our customers.  More than three years ago, I stated our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And this is an ambition I will see through to its full completion. Following my elevation of Chairman and CEO, I'm delighted to announce that CJ Desai has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. CJ is the leader of consequence, well known in the industry. His track record in ServiceNow speaks for itself from strengthening our platform to driving our customer experience. This is exactly how we are orchestrating our company to perform on an end-to-end basis from innovation to execution with our customers. And I'd like to personally congratulate CJ for his latest well-deserved endorsement of his leadership. Congratulations, CJ.  In other news, we proudly welcome Masatoshi Suzuki as the new President of ServiceNow Japan. He brings a long history of successful leadership with some of the industries most respected brands. We will elevate ServiceNow Japan to a fourth geographic region reporting directly to our proven Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Smith. And to add fuel to the growth buyer, we rolled out a new partner program to help our ecosystem drive full platform adoption of ServiceNow. We're also getting an enthusiastic reception for the company's premier global initiative RiseUp with ServiceNow. And under the thoughtful leadership of Lara Caimi, we will continue to rise up. We offer the training and certification to help people build a lifelong career working on this platform. We have never seen so much interest in the ServiceNow franchise around the world as we are seeing right now.  And from an ongoing operating perspective, we entered 2023 with much stronger sales coverage on a year-over-year basis. We have the feet on the street. We also see stronger pipeline coverage and the maturity of that pipeline, much more so than we did a year ago. The latest Glassdoor ratings feature ServiceNow as the 9th best place to work in the United States, 2nd best in the United Kingdom. The company is fully invested in all of our stated ESG objectives with our global impact report coming later this year. All this is a reflection of our proud culture built on Fred Luddy's founding vision for our company. I was just in Las Vegas last week for our sales kick-off of them. And I can tell you, our team is fired up and ready to go for the year ahead. Really fired up. I can only reiterate that we have said consistently, there is only one way forward, and that is innovation. IDC says that by 2027, the number of digital businesses on the S&P 500 would double. Every industry is being reframed by a new paradigm or several. The participants that lean in will lead, the others will fall behind and quickly. For ServiceNow, we are committed to make the world work better for everyone. Our fundamentals are operating at peak performance, net new innovation for our customers, business impact, driving long-term stickiness of our platform and network effects, giving us a competitive moat with multiple avenues for market expansion and profitable growth with a pristine balance sheet. All in all, when people talk about cloud economics, ServiceNow is the blue chip standard. Whatever the world lacks in stability, we will more than offset with relentless execution. Our customers need to automate for cost reduction and to innovate for growth. Yes, ServiceNow helps them do both. The world works with ServiceNow as the end-to-end platform for digital transformation.  I'd like to personally thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their steadfast trust in ServiceNow. You can count on us. We're in your service, hungry and humble as ever. I'd like to now hand the call over to our CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill, and happy New Year to all of you who are listening in. Q4 was another great quarter of execution. We exceeded our subscription revenue guidance and drove strong renewal and expansion rates. Our operating and free cash flow margins also exceeded our outlook as disciplined cost management drove tailwinds to profitability.  In Q4, subscription revenues were $1.86 billion, growing 27.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 50 basis points. RPO ended the year at approximately $14 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $6.94 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth and a versus our guidance, primarily driven by favorable FX movements in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, growth was 25.5%. While constant currency cRPO growth came in just shy of our guidance of 26%, we actually outperformed our target for net new ACV and renewal ACV for contracts expiring in the quarter. The delta came from fewer early 2023 renewals than is typical in the fourth quarter.  Given our strong renewal rates, which remain the best-in-class 98% in Q4, this is only a timing issue. We expect these customers to ultimately renew upon contract expirations, providing opportunities to drive further expansion throughout 2023. The timing of early renewals does not impact 2023 subscription revenue growth, only RPO. Net new ACV would drives incremental revenue growth, and there, we exceeded our forecast. Our larger-than-average Q4 customer cohort not only renewed at a very strong rate, net expansion also remained robust. What's more, the strength in net new ACV wasn\u2019t limited to existing customers. New customer net new ACV grew over 30%.  We ended the quarter with 1,637 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail and hospitality and transportation and logistics saw net new ACV growth of well over 100% year-over-year. Government remained strong, growing more than 50% year-over-year. Manufacturing and financial services also saw healthy double-digit growth. We closed 126 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including 2 of our top 5 largest ever. In addition, we saw 100% increases in the number of both $5 million plus and 10 million-plus net new ACV deals. More and more customers are seeing the true power of the ServiceNow portfolio as a unified platform. That's leading to more multiproduct deals in Q4, 5 of our top 10 deals contain 10 or more products.  Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 28%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by disciplined spend management and less-than-expected FX headwinds. Our free cash flow margin was 53%, up 650 basis points year-over-year. For full year 2022, operating margin was 26%, 100 basis points above our guidance and free cash flow margin was 30%, also 100 basis points above our guidance. Total free cash flow for 2022 was a robust $2.2 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $6.4 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability.  Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the trends we are seeing. Heading into 2023, we believe we have prudently factored in the evolving macro crosswinds into our guidance. Overall, the demand environment remains healthy, deals getting done, the market opportunity is growing, the ecosystem is expanding, our renewal and net expansion rates ended the year strong, our pipeline is robust.  With that in mind, let's turn to our 2023 outlook. We expect subscription revenues between $8.44 billion and $8.5 billion, representing 22.5% to 23.5% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, reflecting the expected diminishing impact of the change in useful life of our data center equipment as well as investments to accelerate customer time to value as part of our impact offering and higher inflation. We expect operating margin of 26% as sales and marketing efficiencies are offsetting headwinds from gross margins. We expect free cash flow margin of 30%. And we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million. For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $1.99 billion and $2 billion, representing 25% to 25.5% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 300 basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 24% on a constant currency basis, excluding 300 basis points of FX headwind. We expect an operating margin of 24%, and we expect 204 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.  In conclusion, we had a strong Q4, capping a resilient year. As we enter 2023, the macro challenges many enterprises face underscore a point we have made consistently. The technology strategy has become the business strategy. Digital technologies are growth-stimulating deflationary force. They power new business models, accelerating productivity while reducing costs. Our unique ability to drive business model transformation while delivering efficiency gains has created durable demand for the Now Platform. Our investment strategy is a laser focus on our customers' most pressing issues, and that continuous net new innovation translates into net new business for ServiceNow. We are well positioned for 2023 and remain on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  Finally, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this year. Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question this afternoon from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : And congratulations, everybody. Bill, we continue to hear from some of your largest partners of the great opportunity ahead in the middle office for which ServiceNow platform just seems to be ideally suited. How are customers prioritizing these opportunities right now and into this year? And how do you position yourselves particularly with partners and vertical industry solutions to best capture it? And I've got a follow-up for Gina. William McDermott : Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. And before I answer the first question, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to officially welcome CJ Desai as our newly President and COO, who is joining me here today. and I will have him continue to join me on these calls. And I'd also like to acknowledge Gina for powering through while she's a bit under the weather, so please her voice might be a little scratchy, but her passion is on fire. So she's in good shape, but losing her voice a little bit. We've been all over the world from Davos to Vegas to here. So that's what happens when you travel a little bit. Brad, the partners and the largest partners are really doubling down on their investment with ServiceNow. And I look at it as a multifaceted situation. First, on this RiseUp with ServiceNow, we're going to train 1 million people in the ecosystem to be fully certified on the platform to ensure that we globally scale. Second, partners are teaming up with us on an industry domain basis also based on persona and mapping that back to our solution road map and naturally, everybody is all in on the platform. So the big ones are really doubling down on the platform. What's interesting, and you bring up a good point, this is for the front, the mid and the back office. And there's a next-generation ERP evolving here with things like procure-to-pay, optimizing supply chains and other things that definitely impact the middle office. But I would also say we have a great opportunity. And if you saw our new business surge in Q4, you're seeing it play out, where we're going to net new logos and drawing net new business. And I think that will be a big part of it. CJ, you may want to build on it from what you're seeing in the middle office. CJ Desai : But is, I would say, when we look at the engagement layer, engagement layer has been around for a long time, say, for a customer service request. So for a large financial services organization, moving the workflow from the engagement layer on, say, customer complain to the mid office where we really shine because of our interoperability of the platform and our ability to integrate the systems and to different clouds all the way to the back office. And that's what is driving the middle office acceleration, whether that's for a financial services organization, telecommunications or a health care organization. William McDermott : Excellent. And I know, Brad, do you have the second question, I think, for Gina. Brad Zelnick : And congrats. I was remiss in not congratulating you, CJ. For you Gina, I appreciate the additional disclosure on net new ACV. You guys clearly had a really strong quarter for new business, which is what matters most to investors. But as we think about cRPO and what you shared with us, I mean, we're all trying to understand the customer mindset during these uncertain times. Is it fair to conclude that perhaps there was less of a traditional Q4 IT budget flush in 2023? And if not, what else would be the rationale as to why you would see that phenomenon? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, of course, Brad. Thanks for the question and apologies for my throat. So I think what you're seeing is early renewals were always correlated and still always correlated to net new ACV. And when people early renew, it's really about co-terming multiple contracts. And certainly, in the current environment, when -- I don't know if you want to say it's less budget flush or just more tightening of budgets, the need or the desire to co-term the contract is a little bit less than what we've seen historically. Not altogether surprising given the current macro. It's why I wanted to be really clear about the fact that early renewals have no impact on future revenue, right? And in the quarter, our target forecast for net new ACV as well as renewal ACV within the quarter actually overachieved, which is why we were able to come out with a strong 2023 revenue guide and why we feel good about not only the Q4 results, but also the position that we stand in the market as well entering 2023. Operator : We go next now to Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Congrats from me as well, and Gina, I hope you feel better soon. A quick question. If you think about the different pockets of growth, you saw this quarter that the HR and CRM part was a little bit stronger for Q4. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers? Because like ITSM, ITOM, you're kind of the #1 player. And the other ones you're expanding. So it's nice to see the expansion in them. And then I had one follow-up for Gina. William McDermott : Yes, I'll make the first point, Raimo. And then I think CJ can actually even give you some customer examples that might be helpful. We have become the platform for digital transformation, and that's an end-to-end platform for digital transformation. So what you're seeing now is a company that has evolved from IT to the employee experience to customer service management. And obviously, the low code platform and how the creative workflow is exploding is demonstrated in our outstanding results and our very strong guide. So we're really now a platform company with a multiproduct approach to helping every customer in the industry they operate in, based on the persona we're discussing business with and ultimately, it's that completeness of vision now that has made us one of -- about a handful of companies in the entire world that really matter in the enterprise. CJ, you've got some examples you want to talk about? CJ Desai : Absolutely. So employee experience and employee productivity are two sides of the same coin. And with our HR service delivery product that is resonating really well, whether it's in commercial markets, including we had a very strong public sector performance as Gina outlined, where that product is resonating. And during this macroeconomic times, when you think about customer service, you want to hold on to your customers and you want to serve them profitability. That's what is driving business for our customer service management product. So we are seeing that despite the technology foundation where IT is the business, digital services other business which is what driving our ITSM and ITOM product lines and what we call service operations, picking the best of service management and operations management, but HR and our customer service management are also driving growth in very specific industries from telco to public sector and health care. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. That was very clear. And then the Gina one for you quickly, on the margin and cash flow outperformance. Can you talk a little bit about factors that we should consider in terms of timing, et cetera, that might have impacted this more, will we kind of don't want to extrapolate into next year, et cetera. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. It's a great question, Raimo. So I gave a good strong guide for operating margin as well as free cash flow margin for 2023. I think what you saw in Q4 from an operating margin perspective was continued discipline on the cost side, as you have seen us do and as you will consistently see us do. On the free cash flow side, obviously, that disciplined cost management flows through. But also, we did see some CapEx spend come through towards the tail end of Q4, which means that the payments are not due until Q1 of '23. So that does drive a little bit of headwind on the free cash flow margin in '23, which is why you see the guide that I gave. Hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : We go next now to Sterling Auty at MoffettNathanson. Sterling Auty : Just want to circle back on the cRPO. Given the constant currency was 25.5%, is more of the issue that you described more happening internationally than in the U.S.? And how should we think about kind of the appetite to do renewals? And is there any concern about expansions from some of those international customers here in the first part of '23? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Surely, it has nothing to do with the renewal dynamics internationally versus domestic. The difference between the constant currency growth and nominal growth really just has to do with FX rates that moved within the quarter. So no real differences internationally versus the Americas on the renewal side of things. With respect to the early renewals, what I would point to is the strong net new ACV growth in Q4 tells you. And by the way, very strong expansion rate in Q4 tells you that customers are not changing their behaviors with respect to renewals, on-time renewals or with net new expansion. What you're just seeing is a little bit of the lack of meeting to do co-terms and bring things forward in the current macro. Again, with 98% renewal rates across the board, we remain as positive as ever that not only will we continue to expand in '23, as you've seen us do in '22, but also continue to renew those best-in-class renewal rates. Operator : We'll go next now to Karl at UBS. Karl Keirstead : Sorry for asking you use your voice again. But how are you feeling about the 2024 targets? I think the consensus to you is that the $11 billion might be a little bit of a stretch given that you've had to absorb a pretty heavy FX headwind. The operating margin target of 27% seems doable. But when I look at your free cash flow target of 33%, that would be a 300 bps improvement in calendar '25. So that one feels like a little bit of a push. Do you mind just commenting on those targets, much appreciated. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Great question, Karl. What I would say is, overall, the underlying growth that we're seeing remains healthy. FX headwinds have eased slightly, but certainly are still material. And with the uncertain macro backdrop, we're going to continue to monitor the market and provide an update on our long-term targets at our Analyst Day in May. So I'd say, again, underlying demand, really strong; operating margin, well on the trajectory to hit 27%; with respect to top line and free cash flow, with the impact of FX, and that keeps moving along, we'll update those targets for you in May. But let's go back to what Bill talked about earlier. We remain very well positioned given the current macro environment. We are the platform of choice for digital transformation. And that opportunity is -- has not changed. If anything, it continues to grow. Operator : We'll hear next now from Mark Murphy of JP Morgan. Mark Murphy : Bill, just given your comments on the pipeline coverage and also the maturity, would you say that the macro headwinds have actually dissipated somewhat if you compare it back to the summer? Or -- are those winds still blowing fairly steadily, but you're just able to kind of navigate through them through will power and execution rigor? William McDermott : Yes, Mark, thank you very much for the question. I did call it out. I think maybe we were the first ones to call it out that there were some clouds on the horizon back then with the macro, and we all know the forces that were blowing between Ukraine, inflation, tightening monetary policies and supply chain dislocation, and everyone sees that to a halt so we don't need to go there. I think what happened back then is most businesses were not ready for that market. And we immediately revamped our go-to-market in the way we approached the customer because we knew the customer would have to do more with less, automate their business, take cost out and improve productivity per person.  And the work wasn't going to go away. It still had to be done, and step ServiceNow's platform. And then we also knew at the same time that CEOs, 98% of them, this is a fact have a digital-first strategy. Worried about the other 2%, but I'm good with the 98% because that makes a lot of sense. And we also knew that they weren't going to give up on their digital business dreams and they would be investing to reorient business models, as Gina said and think differently about their enterprise, which CJ's example underscored and growth would still remain on the agenda. It's just a question of what equilibrium between growth and cost takeout would be necessary for them to achieve their goals. The good thing is, with ServiceNow's platform, you could say yes to both.  And you don't have to make that choice. So what I see in the market, I see commodity tech that was at the peak of the hype cycle during the pandemic being dialed down or eliminated. And I see that investment freeing up to platforms that actually matter. So I do think our circumstances are actually improving because of this particular macro, because it's well known now that ServiceNow can take the cost down, if that's what you need immediately. And given the layoffs that we're seeing and the stories that we're reading, I clearly see that our company is rising accordingly. And I see that in the pipeline. I see that in the maturity of the pipeline which is a really important fact. And this year, we came in with sales productivity at least 20% better than I had at the start of last year based on the feet on the street and the readiness of those feets because they've been well trained and certified to do their job. All these forces are coming together in a way that gives me a feeling the market will be on our side, but our executional excellence will never have to rely on the weather conditions. We're ready. Mark Murphy : Very clear. And Gina, sorry again giving your voice. But just again, on the topic of the lower mix of early renewals from 2023, should we interpret it at all as customers may be a little hesitant to renew early just because of the cost of capital is higher. They want to hang on to cash a little longer? Or on the flip side, is there some element of maybe you actually enjoyed the luxury of not having to encourage as many early renewals because you did see so much strength on the new logo side? Gina Mastantuono : A great point, Mark. And certainly, I think you're seeing a little bit of both. And what I keep telling folks is the fact that we are not having to rely on early renewals as much as we've done in the past, shows the resilience and the strength and the power of the Now Platform. But yes, I also think that in this market, people are holding on to cash a little bit longer. And that's not altogether surprising either. William McDermott : And Mark, one thing I would just build on what Gina is saying, and for every investor out there, when you don't need to rely on early renewals, that means you have a competitive advantage with your technology. It also means that you're able to preserve your pricing power as you go into the renewal cycles on the normal terms. So this is actually a super healthy thing, and that's why the guide for 2023 was above all the consensus estimates that you guys have. Operator : The next map to Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs. Kasthuri Rangan : I would think that in a time of inflationary environments that people would want to get rid of cash and preserve the purchasing power. But anyways, a little counterintuitive. That was not my question anyway. So congratulations, first of all, Bill, CJ and Gina. I will spare you. I'll give you some time off and not ask you a question, so you can rest your voice. Bill, one thing that occurs to me is that you've scaled a very successful technology company before. So what are the patterns that you see at this point of the evolution of ServiceNow there could be so many things that you could be doing from differently, from a go-to-market perspective, verticalizing the product, expanded distribution partnerships with resellers potentially. There's so much innovation. I look at the number of products that you have, it's mind blowing. Almost complex. How do you ensure that this all does not get in the way of your mission to build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century? How do you make these catalysts and tailwinds and make ensure that nothing gets in the way since you've especially seen this pattern play out and you've successfully done this before? William McDermott : Yes, absolutely. Yes, Kash, as I said, we've been through this movie before, and I'd like to show. So here's the situation. We're keeping it real simple for 22,000 of our closest friends within ServiceNow and for our partners. We have the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. That platform is applicable to each industry and every persona within the enterprise. And we are going to expand that across the world. And you saw the move we made with Japan. Our ambitions are going to India, to the Middle East and many other places. So end-to-end platform, by industry, persona and geo, and we kept it very simple for our colleagues and also our partners. We focused on net new innovation. We will build the future. We have the best engineering leader and the best engineering team in the industry, hard stop. We have an incredible go-to-market machine, and we're betting on ourselves. So we're going to keep a real simple around net new innovation and net new ACV. That's it. And with a loyal customer base that will remain ever loyal with many upsells, cross-sells and same account revenue growth, if you get new business on top of that because you're building the best product in the world, you're going to have the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. Operator : We go next now to Peter Weed at Bernstein. Peter Weed : And congratulations on the performance, particularly on the net new ACV. In fact, that's what I'd love to help -- a little bit help unpacking that because obviously, it's including both new logos and expansion. And I think we heard last quarter and correct me if I'm wrong, that new customer acquisition had slowed relative to, say, Q2 where I think for new revenue, you had talked about maybe 10% of growth was coming from new customers. When you look forward now and looking forward to next year and the revenue growth, are you seeing most of that growth coming from existing customers relative to what you would have normally done with new customers, I guess, is part of the question. And then the other side of the question is it appears that NRR declined by about 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter and in your guide, it would anticipate continuing decline in NRR by probably another 300 basis points to hit your guide. What is really creating that weakness in the kind of the renewal NRR relative to recent quarters that have been pretty consistently at or above 130%? Gina Mastantuono : Peter, I'll take the first question. So clearly, we're thrilled with the net new ACV growth that we're seeing, and not only are our expansion rates strong within the quarter and for the full year in 2022, we were really, really pleased to see that new customer, net new ACV grew over 30% year-over-year despite the headwinds. And we've talked about this in the past. We've really evolved our focus away from the number and the volume of new customers to landing the right new customers that can land with us and expand with us over time. And so the fact that these new lands are growing is testament to the platform, a testament to the breadth of products on the platform. And so as we think about 2023 and beyond, we absolutely expect to continue to see very strong expansion rates as well as good new logo growth. But again, it's about not the volume of those new logos, but the quality. And really, you can see that in our results. With respect to your comment on NRR declining by 300 basis points, that's not what we're seeing. I'm not sure what math you're doing, but I'm sure that off-line, Darren can talk you through it. But our net retention rate and expansion rate remains very strong in Q4 and for the whole year in 2022. Operator : We go next to now to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : And very nice end to the year with that new business growth there. Gina, I wanted to dig in on gross margins a little bit. I'm still trying to wrap my head around a 200 basis point decline. We haven't seen 84% subscription gross margins in ServiceNow since 2016, if I'm looking on my model correctly, I believe. You told us last year at this time that there's still an incremental 50 basis points of tailwind that you can get from the accounting change on useful life. So there's somewhere a 250 basis point offset that's driving down gross margins. Can you help us understand what that is, a little bit better? What's that added expense that had such a weight on gross margin heading into FY '23? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Great question, Keith. So first of all, your math is a little off, right? So we had in 2021, we had 85% gross margin, and then this year, 86%. And we talked about that 100 basis points being the change in depreciation life of our assets. And we've said that 100 basis points was going to come down to 50, right? So you take 86, you come off to 50, that gives you 85.5. And so what you're seeing, what I tried to call out in my script is, number one, we are seeing impacts of inflation, right, not surprising, and we've talked about. But also, we are also investing heavily in ensuring that our customers are getting to success in getting to implementation much faster with respect to our impact products. And so very conscious investment decisions being made there, offset by sales and marketing efficiencies that you've come to expect from us, which is why the operating margin guide remains absolutely where you would have expected to be because we're making investments in cost of sales to get our customers to implementation as a value faster, offset by the sales and marketing efficiencies. Operator : We'll take our next question now from Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research. Aleksandr Zukin : Congrats, CJ. Congrats guys on a solid quarter. I guess, we're all trying to unpack, I think, 2 metrics that would be very, very helpful from the quarter itself. So apologies for the more financial-oriented question. But Gina, can you quantify the renewal headwind from the -- from the smaller early renewals? And can you comment on the net retention rate itself? Was it still 125 for the full year? Because when you take a step back, it looks like the cRPO guide for Q1 is a lot stronger than where people thought it would be, which implies that maybe that renewal headwind becomes a tailwind if you get those renewals or maybe you've got them already in the quarter. And the guide for the full year, to your point, is I think, a lot stronger than what people realize. So we're all trying to kind of piece together that -- those 2 dynamics and questions. Gina Mastantuono : I won't quantify the exact renewal headwind. But what I would say is that if not for the early renewals, we would have beat our cRPO guide. And with respect to the NRR, while we don't comment on exact numbers, it was absolutely consistent and relatively close to the 125 that you quote. Aleksandr Zukin : Perfect. Super helpful. And I guess maybe a technical one or a product-oriented one for you, Bill or CJ. With respect to some of the other new areas of innovation that you're bringing to bear, particularly in industries going forward. Can you maybe highlight some early anecdotes and examples of kind of some of the larger customer wins and verticals that give you confidence to kind of pour gas on the fire there? CJ Desai : Absolutely. So great to hear from you, Alex. I would say one of the products that we verticalized pretty early on was in the telco media and tech. -- back in -- started building that in 2019, seeing very strong traction, everything from order management to mid office to back office in telcos. And that product line which was created for that industry is now at top 10 telcos and continue to win market share and displace multiple systems, whether it's a telco company or a media company. Similarly, the public sector, we created a product for public sector as well as health care that is seeing strong traction as well. And overall, between the new products, horizontal products like we have done in the world of ERP on procure to pay or supplier life cycle management, combined that with some of these new industry products, we are winning 7-figure deals, sometimes much larger and having massive traction in that specific where customers are actually going live in 3 to 4 months. William McDermott : Thank you, Alex. By the way, CJ had one go live yesterday with 50,000 agents, and we were in the board room together as we were watching the go live and it was flawless. So that's a customer service management example for one of the most prestigious brands in the world. So you can count on our customer service management business to continue to rock the house. So we're ready to go. And by the way, I don't get caught up in the cRPO thing because it's only a forecasting based on prior year assumptions, has nothing to do with what actually happened. The net new business was fantastic. And all those renewals are sitting for us in 2023. And obviously, because we're delivering business value and impact, it is sitting there for us at the right pricing structure. So it's actually a super good thing from a shareholder value creation perspective. Operator : We can go next now to Brad Reback at Stifel. Brad Reback : Bill, last week, you spoke pretty adamantly about continuing to hire. Hiring net new downtick a little bit here in 4Q versus the previous few quarters. Maybe you can give us an idea of what the plan is for this year. William McDermott : Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. As Gina said, we're going to be very intentional about how we manage the headcount in the corporation. We are protecting this house as a primary objective. And we have invested very heavily now for the last 3.5 years, for sure, on headcount. And we have what we need. Where we are investing, and we'll continue to invest, primarily will be coders, people that actually write the code and also people that are actually responsible for the customer relationship and carry a quota. So we're going to be very, very intentional. And I'm really super because we're in great shape on our workforce. We have really happy workforce. Our retention rates are better than ever. The Glassdoor ranking speaks to some of that. So what we are finding is because of our intentionality, we're getting 9s and 10s in here, and the people we are choosing to hire come from a pool of thousands and thousands and only the best get to go to ServiceNow. And I think that's going to build an even stronger ServiceNow going forward. So no problem with the workforce. Everything is about driving innovation or net new ACV, net new innovation, net new ACV. That's the ball game. Gina Mastantuono : If I could just add, we're entering 2023, and Bill alluded to this earlier, we're entering 2023 with significantly more ramp reps than we entered into '22. So that growth. Yes, we might have had a little bit of a slowdown in hiring in Q4, but that was not on quota-bearing sales or engineering. We're entering 2023 from a ramp reps perspective, very strong, which gives us confidence not only with the pipeline we're seeing, but with the productivity that we'll get out of those ramp ups. Operator : We'll take our next question now from Keith Bachman of BMO. Keith Bachman : Gina, I hope you feel better. Question and a clarification. First, a clarification. It was an impressive metric you provided on the net new customer ACV growth of 30%. Can you just for context, can you give us what that same number would have been last year in the December quarter or an average over the last 2 years in the December quarter? I'm just trying to see what the calibration point is. And then my question, it relates to the upsell. And in particular, on ITOMs and ITSM, in the past, you provided updates on kind of the SKU mix, in other words, going to Pro to Enterprise. If you could just give us an update on -- is that slowing up at all given the economy or are customers kind of forging ahead and just where are -- if you could give us an update on the transition. That's it for me. Gina Mastantuono : Yes, Keith, I'll tell you that 30% net new ACV -- net new customer ACV growth, we're really proud of in the quarter. We haven't given those metrics in prior quarters. Suffice it to say that we continue to see those net new customer ACVs growing as we are landing larger deals with new customers. And those new customers are able to expand with us more. So really strong growth in the quarter, but we've not consistently given that, but to say that we are continuing to see that grow. With respect to ITSM Pro, we've talked about penetration being at about 35%, and that continues to do well. Keith Bachman : And so does that continue to move higher Gina for the year? Or is that kind of -- is there any pressure on that stalling out at all in terms of customers willing to mix up? Gina Mastantuono : It has continued to grow. We don't give that percentage every single quarter. We'll give it every time it hits the next five if that makes sense. But we absolutely are seeing Pro penetration continuing. CJ, I don't know if you want to add any CJ Desai : Absolutely, Keith. Here is what I can say. So the number continues to increase since we launched this -- and what was super encouraging in Q4 was that some of the new logos that we got with ITSM also landed with ITSM Pro besides our existing cohort upgrading to ITSM Pro. So 35%, we are currently very, very optimistic. And at Financial Analyst Day, we will provide bigger updates on what's happening with ITSM Pro and Enterprise. Operator : We will go to Tyler Radke at Citi. Tyler Radke : Maybe for Bill or CJ, just given the widespread conversations around cloud optimizations as we heard from Microsoft last night, can you just talk about how you're approaching these conversations with your customers? Are there specific products that you're leading with? And then CJ, just I would love to get an update on your view on the ServiceNow observability strategy heading into 2023? Kind of what are your key milestones from a product perspective? And how is just the progress gone since the most recent acquisition? CJ Desai : Absolutely. So let's first start with the cloud optimization question. Listen, our product line since day 1, whether you look at ITSM, ITOM or asset management, our ability to discover assets whether they are an on-prem cloud, private cloud, public cloud or multi-cloud has continued to be best-in-class. So we help our customer, they\u2019re trying to optimize their power spend. That's great. If they're trying to move to public cloud and they want to accelerate that journey, that's great too. So our portfolio is best suited for meeting our customers where they are on that cloud journey and where they want to go. So I feel actually pretty good in terms of just our portfolio's relevance in this multi-cloud and how our different product lines can help them with their acceleration and optimization. And on observability, what was really encouraging for me in Q4 is that we had 3 of Fortune 100 companies decided to buy ServiceNow Observability solution and Lightstep at a meaningful scale. And these are real workloads that are really being monitored by our Lightstep solution. And as I think about 2023 milestones, as you know, that Tyler we bought company called Era, which provides log management solution. We will fully integrate that in our Observability platform. So we have not only primary observability solution, but also unified observability solutions that work across multi-states. So very optimistic going into '23. Operator : We do have time for one more question this afternoon. We'll take that now from Sarah Bowler at Macquarie Capital. Sarah Bowler : Congrats to CJ, wonderful to see. Really, I think just given that you're operating in this, what feels like rarefied air, let me sort of flip things over a little bit and ask if there were any verticals that you haven't called out or regions in particular where you saw any softness or perhaps extra layers of scrutiny on overall spending? CJ Desai : So I will say, I'm going to take this, Sarah. Thank you very much. But overall, we feel very balanced performance. Gina called out certain verticals super proud of what we did in public sector. Typically, in Q3, we are expected to do well in public sector. But even in Q4, we did really well and as Gina called out 50% growth. So whether it's public sector, whether it's retail, whether it's health care and others, very balanced performance and strong growth, an amazing quarter. I would say, as Bill just touched on, we are really excited about our growth potential in Japan and India. And with new appointment in Japan and Japan being the core geography according to Paul Smith, Chief Commercial Officer, is somewhere we really want to pay attention to, and we are very optimistic on the market side there. Operator : And again, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to thank you all for joining today's ServiceNow Q4 2022 earnings conference call. Again, that will bring us to end today's call. Thank you for joining us. Have a great afternoon. Goodbye.",

    "content": "\ufeff Kasthuri Rangan : All right. All I ask is, are we ready for GenAI to move to the application layer in the bottom of the NASDAQ, I don't know, 2002, September, October, I forget. NASDAQ thousand stocks that did 8x multiples, not on revenue and earnings. The world feels like it's coming to a crashing end, and I'm depressed. Will I have a job? Will I be -- will software be around? I meet this gentleman, McDermott. 30-minute meeting, I come out feeling great about the company that you just joined, feeling great about the industry, feeling great about my job. I come back energized. Wow. And it's been, what, 22 years? William McDermott : That's right. Kasthuri Rangan : You've had a profound influence on the industry. Thank you for everything that you've done for software. Thank you, SaaS, and the things that you're going to be doing in the future. And thanks, you've been a big source of personal inspiration. Thank you so much. William McDermott : Thank you so much. I appreciate you, brother. Thank you. Kasthuri Rangan : Thank you. William McDermott : Thank you. That's sweet It's really sweet. Thank you so much. Kasthuri Rangan : You got to him credit. Q - Kasthuri Rangan : Now with that [indiscernible], people ask me, why is Bill always bullish? And what are you always bullish? William McDermott : Optimism is the only free [indiscernible]. Kasthuri Rangan : Care to explain more? William McDermott : I'm the guy that wrote the book, \"When his dream.\" And in the opening quotes, by Robert Kennedy, and he said, \"Some men's seeing as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say, why not?\" And that's who I am. And when I think about my life's journey, I just keep getting lucky by working for great brands that have unlimited potential. And if you lead people with innovation, customer-centricity and absolute unbreakable will and the passion to win every single day, it's amazing what can be accomplished when enough people care. And that's pretty much the story. Kasthuri Rangan : You taught to me to dream big. William McDermott : That's right. Kasthuri Rangan : And you asked me -- I will not mention the name of the stock, but 2007, June 29, you said, \"What stock should I buy?\" And like I was blown away by the trust you had me. I mentioned the name of a company that had a fruit thing in -- they were releasing the first smartphone or something. And you said, I bought it. I said, \"God, he did it. He did it.\" Now I got to take everything that I recommend seriously. So tell us where do you want ServiceNow to be in 5 years? What are your long-term aspirations for the company? William McDermott : I always focus, especially in technology, on the innovation of a company. Yesterday, as you know, we had an unbelievable Xanadu release 350 million net new innovations built into our gen AI release, representing 5 million hours of engineering excellence into that one release. So innovation is at the center of everything. If there's no inhibition, there is no hope in tech. We also focus on the culture. I think that it's easy to talk about culture when things are going great. When things aren't going great is when cultures are built. And as you know, a few years ago, things were pretty questionable out there, and companies were laying people off like it was a sport. And we took a very distinct position on that and said, \"We will not lay off anybody at ServiceNow.\" And while there might be some uncertainty in the horizon, once we get cleared, we're going to need all these great people because we only hired 10s and maybe 9s, but definitely not 8s and 7s. So we're going to need them all. And I think really making ServiceNow the best-run company in the information technology industry, where we can say with pride, we take the innovation, we take the culture and we take the way we lead the company, no matter what your position is so seriously because we're all working for the customer and their customers and they're going to need us now more than ever. Every day, they need us now more than ever. And we just started to bring that sense of urgency, and we will what we want. And we want to be the best, and we will it every day, and that's what I want. I want ServiceNow to be the best-run business in the information technology industry. And from a shareholder perspective, I do have goals. And by 2030, for sure, I see ServiceNow, with the exception of the hyperscalers, as the most valuable enterprise software company in the world. Kasthuri Rangan : That's a bold statement. William McDermott : That's what I believe is going to happen, and I don't have a doubt in my mind about it. Kasthuri Rangan : You welcome back to the intervening years of this conference, and we're going to see 2029 when you're back. You guys [indiscernible], okay. I'll remember this. William McDermott : Okay. Kasthuri Rangan : Thank you. Yes. Great. Bill, you talk to customers all the time. What is -- what your feel for the pulse of what they're thinking about? It's already all of this year? What are they thinking about calendar '25, budget expectations, priority? William McDermott : I think they always need to grow, and that somehow seems to get lost. Most people keep talking about expenses and productivity, but in the end, they both have to run a tight shift and keep it lean and productive, but they also have to grow. And I always try to think about what we are doing as creating that single platform, that single pane of glass that resides above 55 years of complexity and a total mess. When you think about the enterprise and the average person having to go in and out of 17 different applications, it's no wonder they want to work from home. Who wants to go to that enterprise? So with ServiceNow, they go into one platform. And all that complexity disappears, and their work becomes enjoyable, becomes a pleasure. Their creative uses can flow. They can get stuff done. So I really truly believe this is a moment in time where we have to help the companies we serve be more productive. Don't waste 1/3 of the workers' time doing silly season stuff. Get that productivity. Get that revenue per employee metric going north, and make sure that you're not only making the workers stay more pleasurable, but you're getting much more output per worker and you can prove It. Now once you free that up in gen AI and the #1 use case for gen AI is process automation, then you also free yourself up to start thinking big and setting audacious goals on how you're going to grow your company, how you're going to unleash your company in new channels, in new ways, how you're going to apply the logic of process automation and data and really giving every employee and every customer an unbelievable experience on an end-to-end basis. So we came to the market with a clear vision to be the AI platform for business transformation. And that's not a department thing, that's an enterprise thing. That's in every industry that serves every persona and that crosses every geography in the global economy. That's what we're doing. And you can grow and you can be efficient and you can drive absolutely great results for your shareholders. That's what we owe every customer. Kasthuri Rangan : That's great. When you look at what's been going on with generative AI, it's largely Jensen Huang was earlier today up on stage here. He did mention your company. I don't think he mentioned any other stuff. He talked about employee workflows, customer workflows being built on ServiceNow. So that's infrastructure. A lot of the money has gone to infrastructure. When do you think GenAI moves to the application layer? William McDermott : Well, first, I want to knowledge, a great leader, visionary like Jensen. When I first came into ServiceNow, believe it or not, it's over 5 years now, the first thing we did, which wasn't even picked up by anybody because we've done this organically, we're the only enterprise software company in the world that crossed $10 billion in ACV, and we didn't have to buy a dimer revenue to do it. Didn't lay anybody off and built our own pathway to the top by innovating great product after product after product. Now when I first came in, we picked up a company called Element AI in Montreal, Canada because we had an immediate vision for AI. And the Touring award-winning [indiscernible] had great researchers and great engineers, but no go-to market. A lot of people forget the go-to market. It's not a good idea to forget that. And by putting it together with ServiceNow, we were able to recode Element AI into the ServiceNow platform, and we've actually been building large language models with Jensen and his great NVIDIA company for that entire time. So our paint isn't wet. We're not a pretender. We actually have real product, and that's what Jensen reacted to and why he might have mentioned us on stage. He calls us the operating system for the enterprise. And he, along with me, believes that this platform that ServiceNow has can manifest itself in helping companies manage their processes at a record clip in terms of speed. We just announced RaptorDB. We're in the database business, by the way. We now have a data workflow platform that we think is not only state-of-the-art, but we already know it's the fastest database in the world and it can do analytic queries faster and better than any database in the world. And we know that as the workflow automates the process, we now have the ability to look at the data from any data source, whether it's a system of record or it's a hyperscaler or it's a lake, we can grab the data as part of the transaction in the workflow. And you can have a complete knowledge graph now of your enterprise, whether it's people, process, data or device on one platform with one clear pane of glass. And you can go into an integration hub and you can see all the systems that you have in the enterprise, all the devices you have in the enterprise. In fact, yesterday, we ran one little query with 1.3 billion different devices in one of the largest companies in the world, sub-second speed. And we studied that, made some assessment on that and can help customers navigate that kind of a complex query instantaneously. And every persona now can simply have a graph and a dashboard, activated in real time on their device or on their desktop. No problem. We do it, and only ServiceNow does it. So this differentiation of innovation is what it's all about. Now as it relates to NVIDIA and hugging face and building things that have never been built before, we decided to go for domain-specific LLMs. And this is also multimodal as you know. But the idea there was to build our own, to literally automate the way IT and the whole estate around IT is run to completely reinvent the employee experience. Who cares about payroll. It's done. But how do I recruit higher onboard train, certify, give you your learning journey, so you're the best in the world at what you do, give you all the services so you can see whatever you need to see, your comp plan, what's happening with my long-term retirement procedures? \"Hey, how am I doing on the health care? I have to take a leave, I have a maternity issue.\" Whatever it is, we do it for you. And you have a great experience still on the mobile. And by the way, there's no call in the 800 number, you have it all. And then when you offboard, we handle that, too. A lot of people have employees that have left their company years ago still on their data. That's a beauty. And then there's the customer and how you service the customer. And a lot of people don't know this, but when you think about customer service management, we blew past 1 billion. And when you think about field service, customer service, you think about the integration of ServiceNow Now Assist with Copilot from Microsoft. And just picture yourself, even Teams, and you want to activate an action in ServiceNow. It's seamless. You don't have to jump in and out of some app or UI, it's already done at a deep engineering level. And so you say, \"Well, how is that an advantage in customer service management?\" Well, if I happen to be in ServiceNow customer service management and I want to completely compose a presentation and perhaps it's a PowerPoint on the slide to make a sale to Goldman Sachs, I can do that instantaneously. I don't have to go into a separate app. It's all engineered together. Kasthuri Rangan : So if you want to make a sale to Gold Sachs, our CEO is actually here. William McDermott : I would very much like that. Thank you, Goldman Sachs. You're actually an excellent customer. As is, 24 out of the top 24 banks in the world. We were 23 out of 24 coming into this year. We handled that situation in the first quarter. We're now 24 out of 24. We love financial services. In fact, our new Gen AI release yesterday, financial services, retail, telco, media, technology, public sector, all of these industries now are getting Gen AI use cases out of the box with the best platform in the world and it's real product. And the other thing we should talk about is creator. A lot of people don't know this, but Creator Now blew past 1 billion last year. And so you say, \"Wow, you mean you actually have developers now creating innovation and applications on the fly?\" Yes. But the best part is with complex workflows and governance procedures, and the development of new applicants, you're doing it on that same platform. So now your CEO knows when you're an engineer that anything you're building is in concert with the business processes and the way the workflow should be automated. And it's not a sidecar project, like the thousands and thousands points of dim light point solutions that are killing companies today, costing them all kinds of money, but dragging their productivity through the ground. All that goes away with ServiceNow. So the word is getting out there. And as the word gets out there, the company just continues to prosper. And that's the most important thing, getting the word out there. Kasthuri Rangan : Bill, what's your vision for Now Assist? In terms of net new ACV, there was a big increase in second quarter. Where do you see this going? William McDermott : Well, quarter-over-quarter, sequentially, we look at this doubling, and it has been doubling and it's going to continue to double because we have a real product. And I think the idea of Now Assist and the GenAI revolution, just think about it, $3 trillion will be spent on AI by enterprises through 2027. 36% of that will be GenAI in the space that we're participating in. So we're fighting for a $1-plus trillion price. So to your point, when do we move past hardware and GPU stacks and get into the app layer or the platform layer? It's now. It has started with ServiceNow. And I think ServiceNow, from what I can tell, you have great companies like Microsoft and NVIDIA that have prospered mightily because of... Kasthuri Rangan : The CTO of Microsoft was sitting here yesterday. William McDermott : Yes. And look, I think that we have built a framework partnership with Microsoft that's unbreakable. We have great partnerships with all the hyperscalers, though, it should be mentioned. I do need to do that because we work with AWS. We also have a partnership now with Google Cloud. And it's important to give the customer choice. And so as you're talking about GenAI, just remember, our domain-specific models, they're not only products, but they run very inexpensively. Customers love that. So just think about 175 GPU versus 1 GPU in terms of the cost to run a domain-specific LLM versus a big model. Think about 0 latency, rocket fast, it's your data and think about total security. Because, again, you're not going on any wild adventures. We're working within the framework of corporation. Customers love that. So that's where it's at now. But there's lots of different innovation. Met is doing a great job. Microsoft is doing a great job. Google is doing a great job, and we integrate seamlessly with all those models. In fact, lots of innovation is going to take place where companies will build their own, and they can bring their own LLM and integrate that into ServiceNow. So this is infinite choice, no limitations, complete open architecture and yet at the same time, very disciplined workflow automation and security across the whole enterprise. Even on security, security companies out there are very good. But some might be good in the cloud, some might be good at a firewall, others might be good at endpoint. We integrate with all of them. And then you can have a complete visibility on how they're all doing at different pieces and parts of the company in real time. So I think this idea of a controlled tower for digital transformation within every company is our calling card, and it's a good one because I don't compete with anybody. I just do something that none of them do. Kasthuri Rangan : Like Stephen Curry? William McDermott : That's it. Kasthuri Rangan : I get pushed back from investors. And hey, the gen AI thing, is it really a business use case? How are customers getting value out of it? I know you've deployed it internally. Can you drill into one or two customers that have deployed GenAI with ServiceNow have gotten meaningful savings that are impacting their bottom line? William McDermott : There's so many. Teleperformance would be an example. USI would be an example, and it's instantaneous ROI, by the way. So this isn't like a hard business case. Let's get the consulting team over there for a month and prove it. This is like -- it's a no-brainer. You're deflecting 90% of the cases that normally had to be managed by agents. So okay, now it's self-service. Just think about that savings. When the case does need to be managed, just think about resolving it in seconds instead of 45 minutes, and then times that by the number of cases. Think about a BT. Think about a London Stock Exchange. Think about creating experiences for the customer that are so uncommonly good that they're undeniable. So I believe that the biggest cases right now would be in managing a case, deflecting a case, closing out a case and making sure that it's an employee experience or customer experience, the time to resolution is so undeniably good that you don't need a computer to understand the business case. You could do it on the back of a napkin. And that's the kind of cases we're going into the market with, and that's why customers absolutely love it. And again, you're not doubling sequentially because you don't have product. That's the key. You've got to have the product. Kasthuri Rangan : Some would say it's build salesmanship, but there's got to be excellent product? William McDermott : There's got to be more than just bill, I mean, because it's a big global economy out there. And if you're the Australia government or you're the Italian government or you're the Saudi Arabian government and the Kingdom and you're buying into ServiceNow, I can't be in all those 3 places at the same time. And if you're looking at the top 2,000 companies in the world, we're getting close to having 90% of them doing something with ServiceNow. And what we think has really, really added a lot of value is now where the CEO's platform. And I think we earned our stripes with the CIO because of the outstanding platform and the notoriety it had in IT, which then evolved into the employee experience, obviously, into the customer experience and to the developer community. But think about the CEOs out there. If you believe -- and you should ask them, the CEOs out there have had it with company spending all kinds of money on IT, all kinds of money on applications. And in the end, they look around the boardroom and they say, \"Why is it that this department can't talk to this department? Why is it that I can have a single threaded end-to-end process in this company that takes my innovation from the foxhole and can move it?\" Okay -- excuse me, from the factory and move it to the foxhole in instantaneous time. Why can't we do that? Well, this system doesn't talk to that system. That data is caught in that volt, then we can't get to it. And it goes on and on and on. And that's not only in the private sector. Obviously, that's in the public sector, which explains why our federal, state and local business, particularly in the United States, blew way past 1 billion because they love us, and it works. And the projects are quick to implement, fast to return value on invested capital. And everybody that does business with us is referenceable and successful. And especially in public sector, they don't want to take chances with these huge programs that used to cost billions and billions. And now instead, they can do it for millions and install it, get it referenceable and make it a showcase in weeks, sometimes months or not years. Kasthuri Rangan : Bill, you talked about the savings from call deflection and whatnot. As you talk to your customers, getting these savings from generative AI, are they saying, \"Okay, I don't need to hire as many people because this thing is saving me money.\" Or are they saying, \"I don't want to plant the other thing.\" but how are they looking at it? Are they looking to cut costs, cut down employment? And you have broader touch therefore, what does this mean for the employment market in customer support and sales and marketing? Is AI going to take away our jobs? William McDermott : I'm going to give you two ways of looking at it. So first, let's talk about the CEO. There's this CEO, a really great conversation. He has done roll-ups and dominated in the insurance industry. I asked him the same question. Dominated. Incredible. And he told me, that he doesn't want his people to have a great experience, but he wants to do so much more with less. Meaning in the event the revenue doesn't go into a hockey stick, he's got to get the productivity out of the headcount that he already has. And he needs technology to bring that value out of each and every employee that he has in the company. So there's definitely a focus on the productivity. On the other hand, he is going to the M&A card and growing very fast because of the M&A, and he's acutely aware of the fact that the value of this company is based on how fast it grows. So he wants to use technology to move the top line. It's not about reducing headcount, it's about leveraging the headcount you already have. In tech, there's many more jobs available than people to fill them. Nobody ever talks about that. Millions of jobs available that aren't getting filled. Yes. And so it's a renaissance of technology that's going on in the world because every company needs to be a tech company. In fact, I think every company needs to be a software company, which is why I think the ServiceNow platform needs to be a standard in every company in the world. The other thing about what people don't know, they're genuinely afraid of. So if you think about Time Magazine in 1966, they ran a big story that computers were going to take away 90% of the jobs in the global economy. That the only people that would actually be employed were high-level managers, and the governments would have to subsidize the other 90%. Jobs would be gone and society would have to carry him because computers were going to do everything. Now I think there's like hundreds of millions of jobs that have been created on tech since then, and obviously, that never came to fruition. I believe, and I sincerely believe this that AI is the well spring of opportunity in the global economy. There are researchers that independently have said it will have an $11 trillion impact on the economy in the next handful of years. I believe that maybe true. Maybe it's 10, maybe it's 9, maybe it's 8, but it's going to be big. And the reason for that is there is so much inefficiency. There is so much waste. There is so much human potential that can be activated by taking the sole crushing work away from people and unleashing them to do things that really matter that can help companies grow and prosper. And that has never been factored into the equation as people think about technology on a day-to-day basis, that's why we're working so hard to tell them the story. Kasthuri Rangan : That's great. Powerful. Tell us about your partnership with Microsoft, the Now Assist working with Office Copilot? And also, if you can, how is the Microsoft Copilot thing going for ServiceNow internally? William McDermott : Yes. We have a great partnership with Microsoft, as I mentioned earlier. If you think about what I said, Copilot and Now Assist are 2 excellent, excellent Gen AI use cases for customers to consider, but they do very different things. And if you think about knowledge work and Office 365 and Teams and Dynamics, by the way, we use Dynamics at ServiceNow. These are all very important things, but they don't do what we do. So let me just give you an example. If you're in Teams and you're doing your day-to-day job. And let's just say, for example, you happen to be in the HR or the technology department and you need to order some new gear for a home office or get a computer delivered to your office because the one that you're using is broken, Microsoft can do a lot of things, but they can't do that. So Now Assist will be assisting you in getting you the form factor configuration that management signed off on, the price that you agreed to in your procurement schedule, and it will go grab what you need, in the form that you needed, at the price you bargained for and deliver it to the address you wanted, and it will be done automatically, instantaneously. And the thing that's going to really be interesting, so you could see how that's going to work for you. But then it'd be really interesting, are these AI agents? Hang with me on this. We see an enormous world of AI agents. Now the thing that's going to happen in the enterprise with AI agents is they are going to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We don't have to get them on any kind of health care plan. We don't really worry about them. We're just going to grind and grind and grind, and they're going to do a lot of the hard stuff. But they're going to be working with people, not just for people, and they're going to be able to think, not just act. They're going to be pretty smart, maybe even as smart, if not smarter than humans. Certainly, in certain ways they will. And this is happening now. You saw the Xanadu release. If you haven't, we got AI agents. Now this is our competitive advantage. Others will have them too, but they will have them in their main. They'll be very specialized and they'll do specialized things, which is fine. Let it happen. But what platform on an [indiscernible] is going to corral all these agents that are running around? Where you have some real [indiscernible] with your strategy on an end-to-end basis, where the finance agents work well with sales agents who understand the engineering agents. And now you've got an organization that's under control, and you have processes that are integrated and the agents are plus up and they're secure. What happens if the agents aren't governed? And this isn't a platform structure around them. You might optimize for one department, but you're not going to optimize the entity, the corporation. And that's what's happened for the last 55 years. Everybody gets to do their own thing, they self-optimize for their department, and the CEO sits back and wonders why I can execute a clear vision across the enterprise on an end-to-end basis with immediacy. Well, everything is trapped in a silo. We took down the walls. And now you can have your agents. We're not competing with other people's agents. That's good, but we'll integrate those agents into workflow automation across the enterprise in a coherent way, so you run a great company. That's going to be the big frontier. Kasthuri Rangan : Next year, when you come back, everybody will have an agent. William McDermott : Yes. Kasthuri Rangan : You can actually ask the agent to take notes and you can actually listen and enjoy the conversation. So on that note, Bill, it's great to have you with us. William McDermott : Thank you. Kasthuri Rangan : We hope you come back again next year. William McDermott : Love to Kash. Kasthuri Rangan : And the year after, and the year after. William McDermott : Thank you all very much. Kasthuri Rangan : Let's give him a round of applause. William McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Thank you. Kasthuri Rangan : Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speakers' prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Darren Yip, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Darren Yip : Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining ServiceNow\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll review our second quarter 2023 results and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2023. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings press release and our SEC filings including the most recent 10-Q and 2022 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We\u2019d also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenue, remaining performance obligations, or RPOs, current RPOs and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Once again, ServiceNow's Q2 results beat expectations for all key performance metrics. Subscription revenue grew 25% in constant currency, 1% above the high-end of our guidance. CRPO grew 24% in constant currency, 1.5% above our guidance, and operating margin was 25%, 2 points above our guidance. We had 70 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, which was up from 54 a year ago or a 30% increase. As the market consolidates, customers are moving to ServiceNow as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. We have now more than 1 trillion workflows running through ServiceNow each year, and that metric is already growing at 40% annually. ServiceNow's long-term trajectory is being supercharged by Generative AI. ServiceNow is the most differentiated asset in enterprise software, AI first mover, organic innovation-led, fast top line growth, best-in-class profitability, 99% renewal rate, early stages of cross-sell expansion around our IT mode. We have said consistently, ServiceNow will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. This Q2 beat and raise is another step forward on that journey. Looking at our solutions portfolio, large deals were evenly spread in Q2, which illustrates the broad appeal of this platform. ITSM was in 16 of the top 20 deals with seven deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 13 of the top 20, also with seven deals over $1 million. Together, security and risk combined for 17 of the top 20 with eight deals over $1 million. Customer workflows had a sensational quarter, its best net new ACV growth in three years. Customer was in 16 of the top 20 deals with eight deals over $1 million. Employee Workflows were in 14 of the top 20 with seven deals over $1 million, and Creator Workflows were in 18 of the top 20, with eight deals over $1 million. Great organizations are transforming with ServiceNow, including Barclays, BT, Honda, HP, Petrobras, CSB Bank in India and Yokohama City in Japan, to name a few. We see a sustained demand environment and pipeline for all of our product businesses, geographic regions and industry verticals. We're set up very well for a strong second-half. As you'll hear from Gina, we are raising our full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin. This is an unprecedented market environment for enterprise software. Our good friend, NVIDIA Co-Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, joined us at Knowledge \u201823 earlier this year. And Jensen stated the expanded NVIDIA-ServiceNow partnership is really important. Their partnership of choice for enterprise IT. He thinks it's an exciting growth opportunity for both companies. We agree. We're in the midst of a dramatic expansion of the software economy. In 2023 alone, IDC says Platform-as-a-Service spending will grow 30%, and Software-as-a-Service applications will grow 17%. When you correlate that to ServiceNow's platform and our workflow leadership, it's clear we live in a great neighborhood on a super nice street, and maybe we're in the best house. With regard to artificial intelligence, especially large language models, ServiceNow strategy has been laser-focused for years. We accelerated that focus with our Element AI acquisition in 2020. Today, by some estimates, Generative AI could boost global GDP by almost $7 trillion. We see unprecedented parallel adoption across consumer and the enterprise. Our platform experts, who have worked for the greatest brands and technology believe this moment is as transformative, if not even more so than the Internet or even the iPhone. But they're careful to remind me, it's all about delivering enterprise-grade, domain-specific large language models, which is the core of ServiceNow's AI strategy. These models will improve the accuracy results, leveraging a customer's enterprise data in alignment with their business rules, while maintaining the highest ethical standards for data privacy. As you saw at our Financial Analyst Day, ServiceNow is infusing Generative AI into all of our workflow offerings. We have since announced, Now Assist for virtual agent, which maximizes productivity by eliminating time spent searching for information. Another example is ServiceNow Generative AI controller. It allows organizations to connect ServiceNow instances to Bolt, Microsoft Azure OpenAI service, and OpenAI API large language models. We're going even further by expanding our Generative AI capabilities with case summarization and text-to-code, text-to-flow and text-to-new-application-development. Our customers are so excited for greater ROI and customer service, better employee self-service experiences and a substantial boost in developer productivity. They are ready to invest to drive these outcomes. And based on the immense value our customers will realize from our Generative AI innovation, we have a clear strategy for monetization. First, our existing Pro offerings had a record quarter in Q2 based on the hyperautomation technologies we already engineered into those products. For all new Generative AI capabilities beginning with our Vancouver release, we will introduce a new set of premium plus SKU offerings across ITSM, CSM and HR SV. We have also introduced a new ServiceNow AI Lighthouse customer program, alongside NVIDIA and Accenture, all in lockstep to accelerate value realization at the cutting edge of Generative AI. Specifically, this involves our engineers locking arms with NVIDIAs to codevelop new use cases for the enterprise. We already have the most significant pharmaceutical, financial services, manufacturing and health care companies engage with us. Additional customers will become design partners for new AI capabilities in their specific industries. We're currently evaluating a range of customers who are candidates for this program, and the interest is continuing to surge. These engagements share one sentiment perfectly in common : The propensity to buy is there. Even as our underlying growth is already strong as our Q2 results indicate, AI represents a market-making tailwind to ServiceNow. Intelligence is only relevant when it is delivered where work actually gets done. It's why our single architecture, single data model workflow platform has never been more relevant than it is right now. As AI goes to work, humans will be the real machines, because in most cases, AI augments people, it doesn't replace them. At a moment when employers face a 17-year high in unfilled job openings, Generative AI will lift human productivity, so we can chase even bigger dreams for the global economy and for the world. With our integrated suite of automation technologies, including AI, RPA and process mining, ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to lead the intelligence revolution, and we will. Looking broadly at the state of our business, we have the momentum with our upcoming Vancouver release in September, our products and engineering team will deliver even more AI innovation. Our partner ecosystem has never been more invested than they are right now. We announced an expanded strategic partnership with Cognizant to accelerate adoption of AI-driven automation. We expanded our partnership with KPMG to co-develop joint offerings through our finance and supply chain workflows. We launched a new collaboration with Guidewire to improve insurance experiences. We're also seeing extensive third-party recognition of our products. ServiceNow has been recognized for AIOps, app engine and cloud observability by prominent industry analysts. From customer service to risk to employee experience and ERP simplification, we can go on and on. This has fueled our rise into the Fortune 500 for the first time. And this is another tribute to Fred Luddy's founding vision for a hungry and humble market-leading company, and we're only getting started. In closing, this is a dynamic period for the IT industry. Think about it this way. Every leader in every department, in every business, in every industry is writing a new playbook for the AI world. CEO's are sponsoring them. The C-suite across all functions is funding them. And for the few true platforms, the opportunity is bigger than ever. ServiceNow injects speed into the business architecture. Our platform has become the de facto standard for intelligent automation. We are a growth company. We are profitable and durable. And thanks to the relentless execution and results speak for themselves, we believe in our people, our culture, our platform and our partners. The world is changing. Imagination is the only limit. ServiceNow is on the move. A CEO I spoke to this summer summed things up perfectly. She said, and I \u201cEverywhere I go, people are talking about ServiceNow. Whatever you all are doing, it's working. \" That's one of the many reasons we proudly say now as ever, the world works with ServiceNow. Thank you all very much. I look forward to your questions. But first, let me turn it over to our great CFO, Gina? Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter for ServiceNow. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range for all of our key performance metrics, delivering robust subscription revenue and CRPO growth, while continuing to drive operating margin expansion and very healthy free cash flow. In Q2, subscription revenues were $2.08 billion, growing 25% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14.2 billion, representing 22.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.2 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, transportation and logistics led the way with over 80% growth in Q2, followed by a very strong growth in education, business and consumer services, energy and utilities and government. In fact, U.S. Federal had its best Q2 ever, continuing the trend of strong growth over the past several quarters. Our best-in-class renewal rate was 99% in Q2, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. With that foundation from which to grow, top line strength in the quarter was further driven by healthy expansion of our existing customers. We ended the quarter with 1,724 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, including 45 paying us over $20 million, a 55% increase year-over-year. The Better Together Story is continuing to resonate with C-suites driving larger multiproduct deals as enterprises are looking to consolidate purchasing with our strategic platforms like ServiceNow. In Q2, 19 of our top 20 deals contained five or more products, with nine of them containing 10 or more products. In addition to our cross sales, our upsell motion also remained very strong. ITSM Pro had its strongest growth quarter since 2020, driven by both upsells from the standard SKU and seed expansions from existing customers. Overall, we closed 70 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up from [54%] (ph) a year ago, representing 30% year-over-year growth. What's more, 12 of those deals were over $5 million, of which three were over $10 million. We also saw a strong performance from our industry SKUs, with our telco and technology SKUs closing six deals over $1 million in net new ACV, and our newly launched public sector SKU gaining further momentum and landing another seven-figure deal in the quarter. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by continued disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 21%. I would also note that given our path to sustained profitability, in Q2, we recorded a large GAAP income tax benefit, reflecting a $965 million valuation allowance release related to our deferred tax assets in the U.S. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7.5 billion in cash and investments. Given the current macro environment and our strong cash position in May, the Board of Directors authorized the company's first-ever share repurchase program. The new program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.5 billion of common stock. The program's primary objective is managing the impact of dilution. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our outlook. While we continue to prudently factor the evolving macro cross win into our guidance, our first half outperformance has driven strong momentum as we head into the back half of the year. As a result, we are raising our top line and operating margin guidance. For 2023, we are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $95 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.6 billion, representing 24.5% to 25% year-over-year growth or 24% on a constant currency basis. We are raising our full-year operating margin target from 26% to 26.5%. And we continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $2.185 billion and $2.195 billion, representing 25.5% to 26% year-over-year growth, or 23% to 23.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect CRPO growth of 25.5% or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 27%, and we expect 206 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, Q2 was another tremendous quarter of outstanding execution, and we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline remains strong as we've already seen $0.5 billion of pipeline generation from our Knowledge 2023 event in May. The week-long event of keynote, panels and customer discussions showcase the power and the endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflows along with the incremental opportunities unlocked with our Gen AI road map. Over $3 billion in pipeline attended with an over 50% increase in executive program attendees. The response has been overwhelming. Our intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation uniquely positions us to seize the opportunities in front of us as we continue to deliver durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company in the 21st Century. Bill and I would also like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. It's their commitment to excellence, which has propelled ServiceNow into the Fortune 500, and we couldn't be proud of. This distinction is a testament to our win as a team of core value and a culmination of the outstanding results we passionately delivered together in service to our customers, partners and investors. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Mastantuono. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And really nice quarter. And what still we're going to stand is still not a super solid spending environment. So it definitely looks like ServiceNow is outperforming in that environment. I'm sure the focal point for a lot of investors though is going to be on sort of the Gen AI. You guys continue to innovate there. You continue to roll out new solutions. And I'm not sure if this is for Bill or Gina, but maybe you could help us, kind of, understand how we should be thinking about the time frame of -- we're going to see some releases in September. But how should we be thinking about the time frame of when this actually gets adopted by customers? And maybe more for Gina. When should we start to think about seeing actually like revenue contributions coming from these Gen AI solutions in the ServiceNow model? Gina Mastantuono : Well, thank you, Keith, for all of those comments. I appreciate that. Vancouver launch is the end of September. So if you think about from a timing perspective, we won't see it even in the market really until Q4. I'll let CJ talk a little bit more about our very exciting Lighthouse program. But as we think about longer-term guidance, right, our scale is such that it's going to take a little while for us to see real impact on the top line, but rest assured, we absolutely are very bullish on the opportunities in front of us as we think about the value that we're creating for our customers with Gen AI. CJ Desai : Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Keith, for the question. And the way I would answer it in terms of the demand that we are seeing from some of the largest companies, some of them that were mentioned earlier from the industry perspective is very real. They believe that Generative AI, in context of ServiceNow, will deliver higher productivity. And I stay consistent that we are going to monetize only when we get higher value that are delivered for our customer and get a fraction of that value, whether it's 10%, 90% or whatever. So if a customer gets 100 points of value, ServiceNow keeps 10%, customer gets 90% of the value. What I mean here is our premium SKUs that Bill outlined will be Pro Plus. So this will be on top of ITSM Pro, CSM Pro, HRSV Pro with an exciting new offering for ServiceNow developers that we showcased at Knowledge, which will be text-to-code, text-to-workflow. These products are being released in September. We will see. We know how our adoption curve was for ITSM Pro and CSM Pro in 2019, so we have some models. But customers want to try it first, see the value, and then we will share with you at the next earnings on how things are going. Keith Weiss : Outstanding. Nice job, guys. CJ Desai : Thank you, Keith. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Keith. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Samad Samana at Jefferies. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on a strong quarter. I want to maybe ask a follow-up question. Gina you mentioned Vancouver is coming out at the end of September. I guess one of the questions I wanted to ask is, is it changing how customers are thinking about renewal timing? And I want to tie that to maybe the CRPO guidance that you just gave for the third quarter. How should we think about what you're thinking about the release, the new products and maybe how that informs the short-term guidance that you've just given for the third quarter and what that maybe implies for the fourth quarter as well as we've been through the rest of this year in particular. Gina Mastantuono : Yes, it's a great question, Samad. And what I'd say is, listen, at the end of the day, what you've seen quarter-after-quarter from ServiceNow is solid execution. The demand environment is very durable. And that being said, we continue to be prudent with our guidance, right? At the end of the day, we absolutely believe that Generative AI could potentially bring renewals forward, but I'm not baking that into a guide right now. We just don't know what that's going to look like. What I can tell you is that from a -- if you think about the Q3 guide versus last year, we have a full-year now of slower macro demand, right? So really Q3 is when things started to shift. The Q3 of last year had an incredible Q4 of \u201821 and an incredible Q1 of \u201822 in that CRPO guide. Our CRPO guide now for Q3 is strong. We are reflecting lower level of early renewals as we continue to see. But you're 100% right. The Generative AI potential and opportunity could absolutely have some upside that we've not reflected into our guide right now. Samad Samana : Great, thanks for that. Congrats again. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Samad. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Matt Hedberg at RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg : Great. I'll offer my congrats again, guys, on the strong quarter. Hearing seat expansion within ITSM Pro is great, especially when there is some investor questions about fewer IT developers in the Gen AI world. Could you put a little bit more context, I guess, a, on what drove that; and b, given the history Bill that you have, what are the long-term trends for developers in this Gen AI world? CJ, obviously, you can comment, but I think you got some perspective there as well. CJ Desai : Okay. So first of all, thanks, Matt, and I will start. As it was outlined that ITSM Pro, as well as CSM Pro, which are very similar, customer-facing agents and employee-facing agents, had amazing growth in second quarter. And even when I look at the percent of total, I feel very good about the Pro trajectory that we have been on in this market for the past few years based on automation and other features that we deliver via Pro. Now on your question on seat expansion, the way I think about it is T times Q times R, where R is the rate of increase. So if you look at ITSM Pro, what we have seen is besides the 25% uplift that Gina shared at the Financial Analyst Day, the seed expansion has been 10%. And so you may ask, okay, why is that? The reason is very simple, as the world is becoming more digitized, as the corporations are becoming more digitized, the incident volumes or a customer service requests are going up. So while they are leveraging the Pro features, the seed expansion is not a coincidence, because number of incidents, whether you look at security incidents, IT incidents, our digital products continue to go up. And that's why I look at T times Q times R where R being the rate of increase on the number of if you keep the quantity constant, that R is driven by higher level of digitization. So when I think about Generative AI specifically, we look at this base of Pro and we think about Pro Plus. And given the value that is already being delivered by Pro, Pro Plus will allow you to gain additional value or whether it's the employees, whether it's our customers' customers or whether it's our agents. And that's why we feel very comfortable with the monetization strategy with Pro Plus because our customers will get value because of higher productivity, and we'll get a small percent of it. Bill McDermott : And Matt, what I would build on from CJ's commentary, is this is the entire enchilada as it relates to transforming businesses. Generative AI and these LLM models are now putting CEOs in a position where they have to come up with a new playbook. So if you're talking, for example, to a telco, media and technology CEO, they're thinking, how do I reinvent my customer service orientation, the offers that I'm making? How do I manage the network? How do I deliver great service operations? Similarly, you might be surprised a little bit to know how forward leaning the public sector is. They're thinking like self-service citizen experience. How do I really rethink citizen-facing assisted services? How do I drive employee productivity and really rethink the way we're running things? And manufacturing, I met with one CEO that for every minute, the shop floor is down or isn't as productive as it should be, every minute is $500,000. So that factory employee, the sourcing and supply chain, building a digital factory, how do I rethink sales and service. And health care, health care CEO who's running probably the most prestigious health care institution in the world said, how do I rethink health care and completely model something that doesn't exist today as it relates to the patient care and how I can move services from an in-house establishment to somebody's home. Like it's all on the table. So the point that I want to make is this. ServiceNow is now in all of those conversations. And many of those you might have thought of as, wow, that sounds like ERP modernization, or probably sounds like a supply chain case or a manufacturing case. So actually, that's the point. We have become the intelligent enterprise for digital transformation, and we're lifting people out of soul-crushing work and modernizing these companies with a 21st Century platform that's resonating. You combine that with LLMs, the combination of NVIDIA and others, I really think this is a once-in-a-generation moment. Matt Hedberg : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Matt. Operator : We'll go next now to Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Yes, thank you. I'll add my congrats. Bill, it sounds like you generated real pipeline coming out of the conference last month. Can you comment on the trend in business confidence and willingness to invest? In particular, is the exit velocity coming out of June and July turning a corner, if you think -- if you compare to how it felt coming out of April and March? And I'm also just curious, is there more consistency in the U.S. or Europe and Asia at the moment? Bill McDermott : Well, thank you very much for the question, Mark. First of all, when we get to the C-level, and we're talking to the corner office, it's all about innovation. And there is no lack of interest in digital transformation. There is no lack of interest in rethinking the employee or the customer experience or even how you empower people to do their best work, especially engineers and IT professionals because the digital strategy has become the business strategy. So the whole thing for us is not so much based on one month or one quarter versus another. It's having a chance to portray the broad vision and the completeness of vision we have with C-level decision-makers that understand what transformation really is all about. So that is the only limiting factor just making sure we get a chance to explain the breadth and depth of our story. In terms of the geographic scenario, we're growing in all of them very well. They each have their own individual scenarios. Obviously, you're well aware of energy and security and obviously, the Ukrainian situation, which is just a human tragedy. Americas is extremely strong. Europe is strong in spite of that because they need technology to dig their way out of a lot of the complexity. And Asia is going well for us, especially in Japan, where we have a new leader now, and we really feel like we planted a flag in Japan, and we have a new frontier that's going to grow really fast. So we're feeling good about all the geos. Some of the industries are doing incredible things. And yet at the same time, I want to make the point back to the platform. We had 19 of our top 20 deals with five or more products in the deal bomb. And in nine of the deals, we had 10 or more products. And that's a tribute to CJ and an amazing engineering team, but also in concert with Paul and our go-to-market machine, the collaboration on taking innovation from the factory and getting it in the hands of the customer quickly is really establishing itself as an art form here. And I'm super proud of the team, and I just want to give it up for the team. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Mark. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Mark. Operator : We'll go next now to John DiFucci at Guggenheim. John DiFucci : Thanks for taking my -- hi Gina, how are you? Thanks for taking my question. So Gina, you said the Fed vertical or the U.S. Fed had its best quarter ever, which is really interesting. I guess, just a little more color on that. Were you referring to new ACV? And if so, whatever you can share with us, like a rough gauge of that? Like how much it grew maybe or anything that you can share further on that? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So John, what I said was that it had its best Q2 ever. And so Q3, as you know, is always a big quarter for Fed. But what I said was continuing the trend. So it had its best Q1 ever. It had its best Q2 ever. It had it best Q4 as well. And so it's not bigger than Q3, but it had a great quarter. It saw $10 million deals, including one over $8 million. And what you're really seeing is that our message around accelerating digital transformation journey is resonating. If you think about what they're looking to really partner with ServiceNow and platforms like ServiceNow, much more through an enterprise lens, more strategic, more multiyear, and they're really looking to digitally transform the citizen experience across the board. And so we're really excited about the continued trends that we're seeing. We have an incredible new leader in Dr. Raj Iyer doing incredible work with that whole team. And so you can only imagine that the opportunity remains really strong. Bill McDermott : And if I could just build one thing on Gina's commentary, John. You might remember the great Kevin Haverty that ran all of our sales force for double-digit years. Kevin, is not only with us, but he oversees the whole government business as an entity for the corporation, and we see amazing opportunities to take what we have done in U.S. federal also state and local, don't forget, 40 out of the 50 states here run in ServiceNow. We see a great opportunity to take that to Asia, specifically India and Japan, obviously, across Europe, Germany, France, the U.K., to name a few, and we also see expansive opportunities in the Middle East. And I just want to shout out to Kevin because him being here and being a part of our future, and also mentoring Raj and really building a powerhouse is just so exciting to me personally. And I love the Fed team, and I just want to give them a little shout out, too, because they're amazing. John DiFucci : Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Gina. And nice job. Nice job, Kevin. Bill McDermott : Yes, thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, John. Operator : We'll go next now to Rob Owens at Piper Sandler. Rob Owens : Great, thank you for taking my question. And I know there's been a lot of discussion around pipeline and enthusiasm towards the second half, but I just want to drill down, I guess, more from an economic standpoint. There's been a lot of discussion, I guess, around the edges here. But as you look at the second-half, willingness to invest from customers, and obviously, ServiceNow is taking share and executing this environment. But do you think that there's an all clear signal here that you're giving us with the strength in this quarter? I just want you to paint the landscape for us. Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. I would not say that we're giving you an all clear sign on the economy, right? I think we continue to execute extremely well, but from a macro perspective, I would say that there's not a whole lot of change, except for the commentary on Gen AI, right? So everyone is really excited about the productivity gains and the value that Gen AI is going to create for the business. What that means for the back half is, I believe, it's early to tell. But at the end of the day, what I'll tell you is our pipeline remains healthy, and we actually see higher pipeline coverage ratios going into Q3 than we saw last year. A lot of momentum coming out of Knowledge \u201823. I talked about in my script, over $3 billion in pipeline attended that Knowledge Conference, and we saw a 50% increase in the executive program attending. So if you think of the C-suite, the higher-up folks are coming to understand what ServiceNow can do and provide. And so we've created approximately $0.5 billion in pipeline to-date out of that event. And we continue to see strong demand for our team to fly out and do demos, similar to what we presented at K23, especially around Gen AI. And so I'd be cautious, like there's not a whole lot of change in the macro, but there's a lot of excitement about what Gen AI, and in particular, with ServiceNow's Gen AI strategy can do for customers in the short, mid and long-term. Bill McDermott : And one set of facts, Rob, that might be interesting to you and others is the loyalty effect. You understand cloud economics, of course, but there's also the human effect of loyalty. Right now, we took a very strong position with our employees that we would remain a loyal to them, no matter the weather conditions in the marketplace, that we would do it together. And we now have the best retention rates in the history of the company. We have 99% retention rate with our customers. So if you take the loyalty effect into consideration, the net present value of what that means, and you combine it with the net new ACV that we think we can get out of this amazing platform and the innovators that are leading the charge for us, we have a tremendous sense of purpose and confidence within the company. And I think that really is fun to watch, and it's pretty thrilling to see what we can do with our customers. And I'm excited about this brave new world. And we're really fired up and ready to go over here. Rob Owens : Great. Thanks for the fine points around the topic. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Rob. Operator : We'll hear next from Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. One for you, Bill and one for CJ. And Gina, we'll get to you on the follow-up calls. Bill, when you look at the last 12 months, challenging time for the economy, but ServiceNow out-executed gain share. So when the cycle turns towards being more constructive. What does ServiceNow pricing power look like? And how do you get value for your Generative AI investments and gain share of the precious IT budget? And one for you, CJ. You talked about $100 of value and how you keep 10. Why not more than 10? And could you tell us how the customer gets that $90 of value? I mean I'm sure that you've done some process mapping, some fancy map financials, et cetera. Just curious to get your thoughts. Thank you so much and congrats once again. Bill McDermott : Yes, Kash, Thank you so much for the question. First of all, the pricing power in a technology company is always representative of its innovation. And again, I can't thank the leaders from CJ all the way through the engineering organization of this company for their great leadership. And I believe strongly, we have something you can reference that's quite fact-based. We have already introduced AI into the ServiceNow platform for some time, as CJ said. And we're seeing the Pro version of the ServiceNow platform grow more than 50%, 5-0 percent, year-on-year. And in terms of putting a figure on it, with Pro Plus, where we are building those LLM models into the ServiceNow platform and extending those partnerships, I'll let CJ talk about what we think we can get, but it is on top, and it is pretty significant because the business cases for the customers are so compelling. CJ Desai : Yes, thank you, Bill, and spot on. So Kash, we have always thought about pricing of services in the context of what value our customers get, whether when we launched ITSM Pro, which was exactly five years ago, and we have kept the same price for ITSM Pro over the past five years. Now in terms of Pro Plus, based on very specific use cases, right? So I'll start with specific use cases, which we call domain specific. Those large language models we do not need to run super large language models because we are saying that, hey, for ITSM, this model will give additional productivity on top of Pro. And that productivity based on the use case could be significant. So from a pricing perspective, on the list price, we would like to be at least minimum, 60% plus when we start on top of Pro. So you're a Pro customer, you're already getting the value. We have seen it over the past five years, and we have seen the seat expansion happen as well. So on Pro Plus, you start with 60% plus. Customers are trying out this large language models. The models have accuracy, they are trying to learn themselves. Hey, do I take the prediction that comes out of large language model? Do I just accept it? But we fundamentally believe, which is what I shared at the Financial Analyst Day, that Generative AI is a tailwind for our business, but most importantly, the value that customers get. So I want to start with explaining the value, because you can say somebody is more productive for a particular task that they are repeating over and over again, but what percent of their day they spend on the task. And how do we look at the particular work week or a customer service agent or an IT agent. And then if we can say, okay, for your industry, for these use cases on ServiceNow, we believe we can deliver very high value, and hence, there is a premium we have Pro Plus. And we'll start with the 10%, 90% map. And as we see more and more value getting delivered, of course, we are going to ask for higher prices. Kash Rangan : Very lucid. Thank you so much. Congrats again. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Kash. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : We'll go next now to [Steve] (ph) Bachman at BMO. Keith Bachman : Hi, it\u2019s Keith Bachman. I wanted to follow-up on that. Just a clarification. In the past, you've had ITSM Pro and Enterprise. Will there still be an Enterprise? Or does the Pro Plus subsume that in some way? And then the question is, at the analyst event that you had, we talked a lot about as Gen AI rolls out, you're not sure what the seat may -- seat count may impact, too. But in the Lighthouse program, I just wondered if you've got any perspective from any customers as they're thinking about rolling out Gen AI solutions where you've had additional thoughts or feedback on how that may increase the seat count. I know, CJ, you said what the seat count has been doing. So I'm really asking on a prospective basis, what seat count may do as you roll out these Gen AI solutions for ITSM, CSM, HR, et cetera? CJ Desai : Absolutely. So first of all, thank you, Keith. Lots of questions in there. And I would say when we launched ITSM Pro in September 2018, the exact same question was asked. And at that point, I said, okay, listen, if -- even if Q remains the same, with the 50% on the list price uplift, we should be able to deliver value for our customers. And how it has played out, though, is that not only we have been able to get 25% uplift on ITSM Pro, but in addition, the seat count went up by 10%, which is the rate of increase. Now when I look at Generative AI, to answer your first question, not only is Pro Plus, because it's also Enterprise Plus. Because Enterprise features are things like process mining, workforce optimization, skills mapping for the workforce in IT or customer service. So these are not related to AI feature set. So enterprise has a very different payload than Pro. So we are Pro Plus as well as Enterprise Plus. So that's number one. And number two, in your question around early customer conversations, customers are still dealing with labor shortage. They are still trying to figure out how they can make their labor force more productive. It is always about efficiency so they can get more work done. And in that environment, I have formed belief right now that Generative AI is a catalyst so that their employee base is still more productive. And so even if Q remains the same, I'm still optimistic on the rate of increase, as well as the price we will get because of the value we are going to deliver. Keith Bachman : Okay, many thanks. Bill McDermott : Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Keith. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next now to Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I think a lot of us are kind of taken aback by some of the pricing commentary on Pro Plus. So I wanted to maybe -- I had other questions, but I'll throw them to the side. I guess as we think about the potential for that type of uplift, can you walk us through, specifically, is this more going to come from a fee increase? Is it more of a consumption dynamic? Is there any thoughts about the percentage of adopting aspirationally you anticipate throughout your client base? And finally, from an investment perspective, is there a big CapEx cycle required? You mentioned the intensity of the models might not be needed to be foundational models in every case. So just can you contextualize some of those points? CJ Desai : Yes, absolutely, Alex. So I'm going to have Gina answer the CapEx and COGS question, and then I'll answer your pricing question. Gina Mastantuono : So from a CapEx perspective, Alex, baked into our margin guide for this year, I'm not concerned, right? So any incremental demand is reflected in the free cash flow for 2023. As we think about going forward, at this point, we don't see any large requirements for increases. But as we see where demand kind of starts coming through in Q3 and Q4, the back half of the year, I'll reflect that in my guide for 2024. But rest assured, as you have known us to always do, if there is some pressure on gross margins as a result of a little bit more CapEx, we'll be offsetting that with operational efficiencies as we continue to roll out Gen AI capabilities within our own organization. CJ Desai : Got it. So Alex, the two things that I do want to share based on Gina's comments is, number one, we do not require large language model with hundreds of billions of parameters because for our domain specific use case, we can run what we have seen with text-to-code, for example, is one-tenth per size of OpenAI model. So that allows us to run it efficiently. It allows us to run while respecting the privacy of our customers' data. So that's number one, and that goes into the COGS answer that Gina gave based on the initial demand and customers that we are working with. Now in terms of your question around P times Q. The uplift that we believe we can absolutely price it as would be on the price. So if the quantity remains the same, the uplift will be on top of Pro with the list price, 60% uplift. And then, of course, our sales team works with enterprise discounts, all that you know how that plays out. And that's why if you assume that, why is that 60% is the number? It is all based on the value that we believe our customers will derive with additional Gen AI features that we are going to release for ITSM or whether it's for customer service management, those things, definitely, there is a cost of R&D and as well as cost to run something like that, but it will always be based on the value they get. So I feel pretty comfortable on the uplift list price on that specific price at the seat level. And then the second thing I would say is that we have seen, because of digitization on ITSM Pro, which was the point I was trying to make earlier, the seats have expanded by 10% over the last five years, while the price uplift that we have realized, which was 50% on top of ITSM, and we got 25%. Bill McDermott : And Alex, one thing I would also like you to know and everybody else is we're getting a lot of new logos. And every time you get a new logo, you get new seats. The other thing is on the platform expansion in the company, we are now in a world where we're selling multi-product solutions, business solutions, to significant companies and industries, and we're communicating with all the personas. So one data point that you might find interesting is that 19 of the top 20 deals this quarter, there was five or more products in there. That's a lot of seats. In nine of our deals, there was 10 or more products in the deal. And then finally, if you think about large-scale enterprise deals, we are growing our deals in the $20-plus million category 50% year-on-year. So we're getting a lot of new seats. And I think that is something that you should always keep in mind. New logos, expanding on the platform in every company, going into new geos, and new personas, all new seats. And then if you apply the logic of innovation and pricing, as CJ said, you're going to get a lot of good outcomes for the customer and for the shareholders. Alex Zukin : Sounds like a pretty good recipe for success, guys. Congrats. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Alex. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Alex. Operator : We'll go next now to Karl Kierstead at UBS. Karl Kierstead : Thank you. Hey Gina, three months ago, you guys put up a solid quarter, but you did tell us that the FINS vertical, which is one of your largest, felt a little wobblier. Macro uncertainty picked up. Do you mind just giving us an update with the passage of three months, how that vertical tracked for ServiceNow in the quarter and how it might through year-end? Thanks so much. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. We -- so if you remember, I talked about the fact that we actually, in Q1, despite the macro stuff going on within that industry, we saw growth in Q1, and that was cycling huge growth in Q1 of 2022. And so we were really pleased with what we saw in Q1. And I would say we continue to see strength in financial services, and we had good growth in there and actually very good as we talked about deals with Barclays, for example. And so we continue to be demonstrating really strong value in all our financial services customers. So continued strength their costs. CJ Desai : Yes. And I'll just add one thing, Karl, on Gina's point, is that specifically in Q2, within Fin in the banking sector, we saw measurable progress across our portfolio, both in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe. So the platform is resonating. The largest of the largest bank expanded. And I can tell you that one bank, which expanded with us, is now close to -- at a TCV level, $100 million when they renewed with us in Q2. So we are seeing that banks are back, and there is a very decent pipeline in the second-half as well. Karl Kierstead : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Karl. Operator : We'll go next now to Peter Weed at AllianceBernstein. Peter Weed : Thank you. I think one of the areas you've been emphasizing as kind of a future growth lever has been the ramping up of channel and its ability to really deliver alongside ServiceNow. And in the past, you've talked maybe 15%, 20% of revenue is kind of really channel directed and more was supported. How is that going? And how large do you see that getting to over the coming year? And is this something that you might start breaking out, something that you might speak about regularly in your earnings going forward? Bill McDermott : Yes, it's a good question, Peter. One of the things that I would just share with the group here is we have really, really great partnerships. And I mentioned the Cognizant partnership, they're accelerating their adoption of AI-driven automation with us and taking that to market. KPMG, reimagining finance, supply chain and procurement. We talked a little bit about Accenture. They're the first mover in joining the ServiceNow customer Lighthouse program. But we also have other channel partners that are developing giving our sales force expanded reach, very large technology companies and reporting on that might be worth doing in the future, certainly wouldn't be against it. But you're right, that a lot of the technology partners, whether they're hyperscalers, they're part of the technology stack or they're just strong technology companies, they recognize the power of their solutions when you combine it with workflow automation from ServiceNow, because then instead of selling boxes or products in a SKU, they move into business solutions. And then they can customize that story by industry. And we're even having some situation in the channel where we're developing smaller bite-sized turnkey solutions that can be sold in a virtual world. So we can do a lot with the channel. I think it's early days for those technology channel partners. The SIs have all adopted us. All have now -- the big ones all have billion-plus practices. One is beyond $5 billion. So you're on a good point, and we'll be sure to talk about that a lot. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Brad Sills of Bank of America. Brad Sills : Oh, great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about Customer Workflows. You called out some strengths there, and you can see it in the net new ACV contribution this quarter. We're certainly hearing that from the channel as well. What would you attribute that strength to? It's such a broad portfolio? Are there any applications or use cases that you're seeing there? And might we expect to see creator follow the trend that you're seeing there with customer? Perhaps there's a channel play here, where there's some pipeline builds and some execution against that. Any color on just what's driving the strength in Customer Workflows and could greater follow that? CJ Desai : Yes. So thank you so much, Brad. So first of all, I would start with, through for CSM also had its best quarter besides Customer Workflow overall, including our field service management also had a great quarter. So when I think about this category, we were very good on tying front office to the mid office to the back office, and that has been our differentiator, not just the engagement layer, but actually getting work done when a customer raises a request. And now we have some of the largest brands in the world, which showed up at our Knowledge \u201823 event on how they are using our Customer Workflow solution, all the way from engagement layer, to mid-office and back-office workflows. So that's number one. The other comments that were shared earlier by Gina is that we are also seeing, in certain specific industries, Customer Workflows resonate really, really well. One is telco, as Gina shared on our industry-specific SKUs, but also when I look at public sector, when I look at government-to-citizen experience, all of that on our ability to get work done on ServiceNow platform and leveraging our back-office experience and tying that to the front office is resonating at the largest brands in United States and Europe. And I remain extremely optimistic on this particular product line as we have transformed how customer can be served better when you tie the front office to the mid office and back office. And on Creator, also very, very nice growth in Q2 driven by just -- there was an earlier comment on U.S. Federal, but we are seeing App Engine, which provides low-code capabilities for our customers, the ability to integrate with all the systems that are available as well as our platform encryption and just the security features of our platform, that is resonating really well from financial services to health care and many other organizations, including sub-verticals within public sector. So App Engine, when you think about low code and the text-to-code innovation that we will deliver in September, which we showcased at our Knowledge Conference, there is so much demand. And Bill touched on this early on when I speak to some of our largest customers, our midsized customers, the backlog on ServiceNow remains very high. And what I mean by backlog, they want to automate more things using ServiceNow. They don't have enough people who can automate more things using ServiceNow. So with Generative AI and text-to-code and text-to-workflow capabilities, that's what really excites them so that they can reduce the backlog, automate more using our platform, so they get higher value and become an efficient organization. Brad Sills : Great to hear. Thanks, CJ. CJ Desai : You bet. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question this afternoon. We'll take that now from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe a quick high-level question on the end. If you think about AI and adoption, this year could be tough for corporates, because the IT budget was set for enterprises last year. There was a lot of inflation from the vendor side. And so you're kind of squeezing AI out of the kind of tightened budget. How do you think about next year? And Bill, maybe in some of your conversations with Board members -- with Boards, like how are they thinking about the generational shift and how that impacts how you budget and how you plan for the coming years? Thank you and congratulations. Bill McDermott : Yes, thank you very much. I want to go back to one of the comments I made earlier. There is no lack of interest in the C-suite for Gen AI. In fact, every one of them knows they have to have a playbook, and they're extremely focused on this. And most of the really forward-leaning ones are demanding of their C-suite direct reports that they're using this in their everyday business activities to run a better company, to run a more margin-efficient company and ultimately, a company that takes better care of their people and their customers. So this is set in stone now. This is real. This is happening. And what's interesting about IT budgets, and this is something that I shared a little bit with Alex earlier, where in IT as the standard, which is great, because the IT strategy has easily become the business strategy, but we are now going across all the personas in an enterprise. And what's great about the cloud business model, a lot of these personas have their own budgets and they're going to fund their own initiatives, and they're looking at ServiceNow now as a company that can fundamentally change the game. So I think that the future is bright. And whether you're thinking about customer and employee service desk where you have virtual agents that are serving queries and general how-twos, you think about text-to-code, you think about automating a classification of different cases and how you resolve them, how you take operational support, not only across IT, but proactively manage cases that go through all the other departments, how you have touchless correspondence and literally onboard all the business processes. So if you're Gina, you're thinking about, who are my partners, who am I going to procure things from, how am I going to make this onboarding process and all the visibility into all business operations completely seamless. So this is what's happening in every company right now. And I think we're going to be a big benefactor, because we became a platform company, and we now have the relationship capital with these executives to go way beyond just the IT budget. Not that, that's not a good place to be, but it's better when you can go into the entirety of the budget. And that's where all the user counts are. That's where the business model innovation is, and that's where we have the biggest impact. So that's where we're going to be. So I think the future, as you look into 2024, is going to be extremely bright. And I think we have to now do all the hard work to make sure we're the benefactor of a big cut of that overall budget in the company, whether it's at the department level or the central IT level. Raimo Lenschow : Yes, okay. Excellent, thank you. Congrats. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Raimo. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentleman, that will bring us to the conclusion of ServiceNow second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great evening. Good-bye.",

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Darren, and thank you everyone for joining us today. On behalf of Gina, CJ, and our entire company, I'd like to first make a brief statement about recent events. ServiceNow has a very special team in Israel. One of our own colleagues Shlomi Sividia was at the Supernova Music Festival. He was murdered in the unprecedented and heinous attack. Shlomi was highly respected, admired, and a good friend to many. We stand in solidarity with our team and with their families. Terrorism has caused the unfathomable humanitarian crisis and now engulfs millions of people in Israel and Gaza. Our hearts pray for the innocent on all sides. Even with optimism in short supply, we choose to honor the dream of a peaceful and prosperous future for the Middle East region. God bless and protect all those in harm's way. Now for business. Of course, that's the reason we're here to discuss ServiceNow's Q3 results. We're proud that our company once again delivered beyond expectation. ServiceNow has delivered subscription revenue that grew by 24.5% in constant currency, over one point above our guidance. cRPO grew a strong 24%. That's 2.5 points above our guidance. Operating margin was 30%, more than 2.5 points above our guidance. We had 83 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV, up from 69 a year ago, a 20% increase year-over-year. Our focus on landing the right new customers, continued to deliver. Large new logo growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. ServiceNow's traction as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation has intensified. All of our workflow businesses were in 14 or more of the top 20 deals, ITSM, ITOM, ITAM, security and risk, customer, employee, and creator. Within our technology workflows, security and risk had a very strong quarter, with 10 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows had a stellar quarter with seven deals over 1 million and one deal over 10 million. From an industry perspective, this was the best US Federal quarter in ServiceNow's history. NNACV was up over 75% year-over-year. US Federal agencies are standardizing on a single platform with a core set of end-to-end solutions. We had 19 federal deals over 1 million, including three deals over 10 million. Our top deal in the quarter, the United States Air Force was the third largest deal in the company's history. You'll hear from Gina that this performance has heightened our confidence for a strong Q4. We're increasing the full year guidance on the top line and the bottom line and here is the key takeaway. AI has strengthened the market dynamics for enterprise software. ServiceNow is the fastest-growing company in this market at relative scale. We have the highest rule of 50 plus across our peer set with the highest growth of any other large-cap software company. We are the best performing enterprise software company to IPO. This is a unique, highly differentiated company that is rewriting the benchmarks to be best-in-class in the SaaS industry. Looking beyond the quarterly results, while the world's challenges are sobering, the digitization imperative is stronger than ever. Gartner forecasts that $3 trillion will be spent on AI and GenAI between 2023 and 2027. GenAI represents 36% of AI spending overall. We believe every dollar of global GDP will be impacted by AI over the next several years. This isn't a hype cycle. It is a generational movement. In the last year, ServiceNow has doubled down on our AI investments. Our Vancouver release includes generative AI-powered Now Assist for every workflow. Others issued press releases. We released product. At ServiceNow, our strategy isn't about exuberance. It's about execution. We carefully laid the groundwork for success and talent and resources and technology. This investment is accelerating our already robust pipeline with customers lining up to be first-movers in this next wave of business transformation. The question we've been asked repeatedly, does AI drive growth? The definitive answer is, yes, it does. GenAI represents a tailwind of growth for ServiceNow. We have over 300 customers in our pipeline from every industry, every buying center and every stage of testing. Our GenAI SKU drove the highest number of customer requests for a pre-release product in our history. We launched Vancouver on September 29th. That left us one day in Q3 to sign deals, and we signed four large deals. A US government agency selected our premium SKU offerings, to be an early adopter of GenAI. Real estate leader, CBRE is harnessing generative AI with ServiceNow to deliver superior service to customers and employees, while reducing costs. NVIDIA is accelerating its own ServiceNow journey with generative AI. Among other leading companies, Teleperformance joined ServiceNow's AI Lighthouse program. They will collaborate on new generative AI use cases that boost productivity while increasing customer and employee satisfaction in key industries. We have a wide range of other customer wins in the quarter as well. FedEx is using ServiceNow to simplify their IT workflows, while building a universal employee portal to improve employee experience for a 0.5 million global employees. One of the world's largest automakers selected ServiceNow to help consolidate dozens of applications into a new modern platform to accelerate their push into the EV market. Philips, Mars, Bank of California, Cleveland Clinic, the US Department of Defense, Fujitsu, Asahi Mutual Insurance, and the State of California are among many others. We see a meaningful path for all customers to recognize value from generative AI, in the quarters to come. Our innovation velocity is very high. Pipeline is growing fast and capacity to execute is well proven and this is just the beginning. Looking holistically at our business, we see progress everywhere. We have an aspiration to significantly increase the percentage of net new revenue, sourced by our partners in the coming years. This is about partners making the ServiceNow platform the core of their emerging business models. One exciting example is our customer Trane Technologies. They are a global climate innovator, which recently announced plans to acquire ServiceNow partner Nuvolo. With Nuvolo, Trane Technologies can bring world-class digital solutions, engineered on the ServiceNow platform to their global customer base. This creates a flywheel effect to ServiceNow, more use cases, drive more workflow automation. And today, we're excited to share that Deloitte and ServiceNow announced an expansion to our alliance. Deloitte will become a pioneering partner, integrating our generative AI capabilities into their leading operate services globally. This addition underscores Deloitte's commitment to enhance performance with cross-industry solutions built on the ServiceNow platform. We're also scaling our ecosystem globally, with today's announcement of a co-investment in ANSR, a market leader in enabling companies to scale technology centers. Another area that we expect to fuel long-term sustainable growth is industry verticalization. Our product development roadmap is expanding with use cases and telecommunications, financial services, retail and the public sector. And beyond any one industry, we increasingly see both intra and inter-enterprise workflow opportunities on the ServiceNow platform. This new generation of business networks is creating value chains that transcend traditional business boundaries. Our rapid pace of workflow innovation creates an even greater demand for our training and skills initiative, RiseUp with ServiceNow. As one example, FutureSkills Prime, a digital skilling initiatives of the Indian government will train thousands of learners across India in new digital skills. This partnership offers clear pathways to build careers as businesses worldwide grow at ServiceNow workforce. Bottom line this all points to grow at ServiceNow. In closing, we are building a company for the ages, by concentrating on customer value, we are creating immense shareholder value. At a strategic level, we chose to set the bar high, to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. We have an inspired team that is committed to our exponential dream. A company is only as great as each member of the team and the team is only as great as the company. That is what culture is all about. Our employee engagement scores increased across the board this year, so did our retention rates, which are already best-in class. We never went for layoffs. We went for thoughtful, careful expansion. When you look at the ongoing momentum from Knowledge '23, it's clear the approach is working. A profitable growth profile of this company speaks for itself. The market is there for us and now we're focused on Q4, delivering a strong full year and a fast start in 2024 as well. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to your questions. Now, I'll turn it over to our outstanding CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q3 marks another quarter of strong execution, as we once again significantly surpassed the high end of our topline growth and profitability guidance metrics. ServiceNow continues to demonstrate its resilience as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. Customers are seeking enhanced productivity solutions in the current macroenvironment and ServiceNow is delivering. In Q3, subscription revenues of $2.216 billion, growing 24.5% year-over-year in constant-currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 100 basis points, amazing organic growth at massive scale. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14.4 billion, representing 23.5% year-over-year constant-currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.43 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant-currency growth, and a 250 basis point beat versus our guidance. As Bill highlighted, Federal has best net new ACV quarter ever, growing over 75% year-over-year. I want to give a quick shout out to the Federal team, who has just been crushing it. Among the other industries, transportation and logistics was very strong, growing over a 100% year-over-year, followed by education, which grew over 75%. Manufacturing and CMC also saw robust growth. We had some outstanding achievements from a workflow standpoint as well. I'm pleased to announce that Creator Workflows crossed 1 billion in ACV in Q3, a monumental milestone, and our Employee Pro SKU saw over 100% growth in net new ACV year-over-year. Retention remained exceptional with the renewal rate of 98% in Q3 reaffirming the essential role the Now Platform plays in our customers' operations. Our customer cohorts displayed solid expansion as the quarter closed with 1,789 customers contributing over 1 million in ACV, with 58% year-over-year growth in those contributing over $20 million. In Q3, we successfully closed 83 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV, with four deals greater than 10 million. Notably, 18 of our top 20 net new ACV deals included eight or more products. By launching at the end of the quarter we have already -- we have also already closed four GenAI-related enterprise deals and we're seeing strong pipeline build for our plus SKUs. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, over 250 basis points above our guidance, driven by disciplined spend management, and the top-line outperformance. Our free cash flow margin was 9%, up 300 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7 billion in cash and investments. In Q3 we repurchased, 0.5 million shares as part of our first-ever share repurchase program, with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. We are raising the full-year outlook to reflect the strength of Q3. As we have done all year, we continue to prudently factor the macro cross-wins into our guidance. This includes incremental FX headwind from a strengthening US dollar. For 2023, we are raising our subscription revenues outlook by $48 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.635 billion to $8.640 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth or 25% on a constant-currency basis. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 26.5% to 27%. And we continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and GAAP-diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.320 billion and $2.325 billion, representing 24.5% to 25% year-over-year growth or 23% to 23.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20.5% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Notably, the strength of our federal business has resulted in a higher mix of 12-month contracts that will create a one point headwind to Q4 cRPO growth and remain a headwind into 2024. We expect that these contracts will renew in 2024 as ServiceNow's federal contract renewal rate are 99%. We expect an operating margin of 27.5% and we expect 206 million GAAP-diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, our team delivered an exceptional performance across the board. With a culture focused on customer success, our people have worked relentlessly to provide solutions to meet enterprise's needs, and it's showing in our robust results. Businesses are looking to consolidate vendors and standardize on a platform with a core set of products, so they can build a predictable and reliable roadmap to drive digital transformation. ServiceNow is that strategic platform. With the addition of our Vancouver release, and the capabilities presented by GenAI, the window of opportunity is even more expansive than ever before. The result is a more powerful, and intelligent platform, that enables customers to ignite end-to-end action, across the enterprise in ways not seen before. It's an exciting opportunity to further improve productivity, and employee satisfaction, optimize processes, reduce costs, and create organizational agility. The possibilities are endless. Bill and I extent our gratitude to all our employees worldwide for their unwavering dedication and commitment that puts us at the forefront of this opportunity, and further driving ServiceNow towards its ambition of becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. If I look at the mix in product -- on the product side, it looks like ITSM and ITOM was very strong this quarter. Can you little bit speak to that? I sense it's probably the big Federal deals, but maybe more broadly what you see in the different product categories. Many thanks and congrats from me. CJ Desai : Hey, Raimo, thank you so much, this is CJ, for the question. Great to hear from you. ITSM and ITOM which we define from a solution perspective as service operation is code of our core. So, as Bill outlined that we had very strong new logo business, and new logos that matter, where we almost always plan with ITSM and ITOM, and in general, we are seeing that ITSM continues to have expansion rates, whether it's via Pro SKUs, or just recently added Pro Plus, and with ITOM and our AIOps strategy, we continue to execute on not only the product roadmap, but how our customers are leveraging those innovations from visibility all the way to health in that digital real estate. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. CJ Desai : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hello. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Bill, CJ, and Gina. Outstanding results. Bill, we've -- we've all been waiting for this recession. Some houses have been calling for a hard landing, and some others aren't. It looks like we've been waiting for ever since the recession to happen, it's not happening. And I'm sure that CEOs that you do business with are -- have been somewhat cautious the last three to four quarters, but it looks like things are stable, and with the tailwind of potentially a soft landing, if I could use that expression, a software landing and AI, as wind -- as wind in your sales, what does the company's growth prospects look like in '24 versus the last couple of years that we've all been slogging through this, granted that you have been executing really well outperforming your peer group. What does the growth curve look like with all these tailwinds ahead of you? Thank you so much and congrats. Bill McDermott : Well, Kash, thank you. I think that's the reason why we've raised our guidance on top of an outstanding quarter like this because we have great confidence in the core business. All CEOs right now are either in a move to increase productivity because of the crosswinds that you referenced in the macro or take costs out. And obviously, while doing so, they also have the added challenge of new business model innovation, such as the auto industry, now dealing with the transition to EV. What's unique about ServiceNow is digital transformation can deflect so many of the cost, and hence the labor-intensive procedures that companies have to deal with to properly serve their market. On top of that, you have one-third of the productivity of knowledge workers getting torn apart by swivel chairing between on average 13 individual applications a day. Now you add the productivity tailwind of generative AI on this once-in-a-generation ServiceNow platform, and you have achieved a very important business transformation. And I think right now, CEOs are focused on business transformation, and when you can give them one common UX that is consumer-grade, that integrates with a half-a-century-old legacy mess that they have to contend with, and we can get the actions that they need done, done, done to achieve cost-out productivity and growth on, they're all about ServiceNow now, and that's why you're seeing these results, and they are sustainable. Kash Rangan : Amazing. Thank you so much. Very inspired. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. Tyler Radke : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the beat on constant-currency current RPO was one of the largest we've seen in quite a while. Could you just unpack was that mostly federal, or was it broad based? And then secondly, Gina, on the current RPO outlook for Q4, can you just help us understand the dynamic with the one point headwind a little bit better? Did Q3 also face that headwind given you booked so many of these large federal contracts? Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : So, thanks. Tyler, thanks so much for the question. So yes, we're very excited. Q3 results were just phenomenal across the board, and the beat on constant-currency cRPO was two things, specifically strong net new ACV growth, and that was primarily driven, but not entirely, primarily, not entirely driven by very strong federal business, which was just fantastic and great business for us. We also did have better federal early renewals. If you remember, we've been really prudent in how we've been forecasting early renewals, given the current macroenvironment. And so the beat this quarter was two-pronged right. So strong net new ACV growth as well as strong early renewals. To your question on the impact of Q4 cRPO and the one point headwind, how Federal agencies usually contract is one year out, right. So their contracts are only 12 months in duration. So it doesn't have a negative impact on Q3, right, because at the end of Q3, you have it in their peripheral year. But at the end of Q4, with one quarter of those contracts roll-off cRPO, it means that there is a headwind to Q4 and because Q4, sorry, because Federal was so strong, and the mix of federal in Q3 was stronger than we've ever seen before, there is that headwind into Q4. But again, as you think about the underlying business, extremely strong results, in fact, Federal business has a strong renewal rate at 99%. So as you think about the underlying health of the business going into '24, it remains very strong. Tyler Radke : Thank you. Bill McDermott : Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Tyler. Operator : We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh : Yeah, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith. I wanted to congratulate the team on the 24% constant -- on the current RPO growth. That was really impressive. You know, Bill, when I looked at what you were talking about in terms of GenAI trials, and landing four customers right at the end of the quarter, in terms of your -- the team's expectation about adoption of IT -- ITSM Pro Plus versus Pro, is there -- do you see a scenario where that adoption could potentially happen faster than the cadence of adoption that you've seen over the last five years with ITSM Pro? I appreciate the -- I appreciate the thoughts. Bill McDermott : Well I can -- I can tell you that we, first of all, I appreciate your question, Keith. You know how well we have done with the Pro version of the platform and there's still plenty of room to expand on that, but the demand that we've seen so far for Pro Plus, and the transformational nature of what customers are now able to do on the Now Platform has led to the single best type that we have seen at ServiceNow. I'll let CJ give you some color on individual customers and some of the actual stories that, I think, you'll find illuminating. CJ Desai : Absolutely. Thank you, Bill, and thanks for the question. So, we have one data point from the last week of September, which, I do not want to translate it to trend. However, we are having many, many conversations with some of the iconic companies, and public sector customers, around ServiceNow's generative AI offering. So when we launched in 2018 Q3 the Pro SKUs, that was a curve that followed over multiple quarters, now 20 quarters, and we know what that looks like. With Pro Plus, what I'm seeing is, it is no longer about the potential of generative AI, where they are questioning is generative AI good for us in context of ServiceNow platform, but the conversations have shifted to, hey, CJ, how long would be -- would it take for us to implement? Does our data strategy need to be aligned, and what about the security, et cetera. So the positive side of this is that we are seeing good demand, and on the cautionary side is, we will work with our customers. They are learning. Like Bill said, the four customers who leaned in and bought our products on the last day of the quarter, but as we move forward, we'll work with these customers, and as we get a couple of quarters under the belt, we will be able to tell you how this is looking versus Pro. So Pro Plus versus Pro. Sanjit Singh : I appreciate the additional thoughts, CJ. Thank you very much. Bill McDermott : And Keith, one thing to keep in mind is Pro is the necessary stepping stone to Pro Plus. So, from a shareholder value creation standpoint, it's plus-plus. Sanjit Singh : Well noted. Thanks Bill. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Keith. Operator : We'll take our next question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. John DiFucci : Thanks for taking my question. And Gina, thanks for all the detail around cRPO. That's really helpful in understanding that metric and I know we've talked about this in the past, but I mean that it's helpful. My question is really around the federal business, which is really -- it's been really strong for at least a year more than offsetting any commercial weakness when it happens like maybe a year ago or so. And just adding to what -- at least what I think is surprising commercial strength as cash sort of hit on that in periods like this quarter. I guess my question is, how sustainable is that federal business in regards to new ACV, which it sounds like it just continues. It's like the energizer bunny, it just sort of keeps on giving. Bill McDermott : Yes. John, I'll start off and then let Gina give you some of her color as well. But our federal business, as I said, had the biggest quarter in ServiceNow's history with 75% year-over-year growth in NNACV, and we had 19 deals that were more than 1 million, including three over 10 million with the US Air Force as the third biggest deal in the history of ServiceNow. And what we're seeing is across all areas, federal agencies are really looking to consolidate contracts, point solutions, the messy middle, and they really want to standardize on a platform with a core set of products that they can grow with. And our GenAI offerings, for example, are really reinforcing our ability to help accelerate their transformation journey, and they're seeing really tremendous opportunity in GenAI on our platform. And we're already seeing early adopters show an interest in domain-specific models, which offer better security, as CJ said, and we're working with some agencies that I can tell care a lot about security. So I think it's really a tribute to ServiceNow's engineering and the way ServiceNow runs our cloud and the manner in which we care for our customers at a deep technical level and they know that they can count on that. And every agency where we've done business is highly referenceable and they're telling our story to other agencies for us. It's really a beautiful force multiplying situation. But I want to leave you with one thought. We're only getting started. With federal, with state, with local, the business transformation that's going to go on in the next decade across all of those categories will play beautifully into our growth agenda, and we'll continue to service it with 100% customer satisfaction. We are fired up with what we're able to do to transform government and make it run like a best run business. Gina Mastantuono : The only thing, I would add, and Bill, fantastic answer. The only thing, I would add, John, is that, this is durable demand. The Federal agency's digitization agenda is only growing, and the success that we've had at Federal, we absolutely have the ability to replicate that outside of the US and public sector around the world. John DiFucci : Thank you very much. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, John. Bill McDermott : Thank you, John. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Bill, the level of confidence that we hear from SIs on maintaining this kind of 20% plus growth trajectory for their ServiceNow practices is truly standing out across the software landscape. One of them surveyed their customers, and the top three topics of interest that came back were Microsoft, Azure, and ServiceNow. So, just in light of that, that joint prioritization there, could you shed a little light on traction with your Microsoft relationship? Is that kicking in already at this stage, and are you able to go to market as a bit of a one-two punch with the Azure co-pilots and Now Assist? Bill McDermott : Yeah. I'll start off, and then please, CJ, feel free to add your opinion on this as well, but our partnership with Microsoft is really geared to open additional addressable market for ServiceNow. And we're doing that by creating and expanding co-sell motion with Microsoft's enterprise sales teams. So that would talk to one-two punch, and ServiceNow is really helping streamline their migrations to Azure, while Azure exposes us to a much wider spectrum of customers. So we saw the partnership influence deals across geos in Q3, including government wins in Americas, and APAC as real driving forces between both Microsoft and ServiceNow. And we really are confident that the partnership, and the synergy with Microsoft does enable us to bring value to more customers, and do so at an unprecedented speed, and I do want to say, that we've been friends, with Satya and myself on a personal level for a long time, and we've done a lot of business together, and the friendship that exists with CJ and the engineering team at Microsoft is very rock-solid, and we trust each other, and we see that our mutual interest is better by working together, but also, we're doing it in the name of the customer. And I think that's the big thing. And I just want to complement CJ and our engineering team, not just for the 5,00 new innovations they brought to the platform this year, that would have been enough, but also for the hands-on relationship with great partners like Microsoft because you got to remember, everything we have has been integrated into Microsoft, from Office 365, to Dynamics, to Teams, to Azure, to AIOps, it's pretty -- pretty amazing when you think about the engineering work and talent that went into putting this together. So this isn't just by let's go to market and two is better than one. This is deep technical integration to serve customers at an unprecedented level. CJ Desai : Bill, you said it well. Mark, the only thing, great to hear from you. The only thing I would add is the engineering collaboration is absolutely necessary, but not sufficient when it comes to go-to-market partnership and relationship we have, working with Microsoft. So, whether it's our financial services customers or healthcare or government customers, when they are trying to leverage ServiceNow, hey, where are my assets? Are my assets healthy? Are they secure? Whether they are running on-prem, or in Azure, we have the best-in class partnership with Microsoft and that is definitely being noticed by some of our largest, as well as mid-sized customers, and brand-new customers. Mark Murphy : Thank you for that extra texture and congrats. Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Mark. Operator : We'll take our next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Karl Keirstead : Okay, great. Maybe I'll direct this one to Gina. Gina, I know from the past when you've had strong Fed quarters that by virtue of those deals, they tend to have, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, a little bit more upfront RevRec. So I'm just curious, you laid out the impact on cRPO, but how does that strong Fed quarter that you saw in September impact the reported subscription revenue, and margins that you put up, and if you could, in any way, maybe size that lift given that, I think, there is more upfront RevRec? Much appreciate it. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah, it's a great question, Karl. Actually quarter-over quarter, year-over-year on-prem has remained consistent. So that hasn't been an impact and so the strength in our revenue in the quarter was the result of extremely fantastic execution by the team. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Good to hear. Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay. Thank you very much. So it's really interesting that you signed four large deals on September 30th, literally, right after the availability of Vancouver, and Now Assist and it sounds like your GenAI Tech was a clear catalyst, if not the catalyst for these transactions. So I guess for Bill or CJ, I assume these were all existing customers, but did they all purchase Pro Plus, did any of them purchase Enterprise Plus or any have been deploying your new text-to-code functionality? Just curious to hear any additional color that you might be able to share. Thank you. CJ Desai : Hey, Gregg. Thanks for the question. I'll take this question. I would say, just to summarize because we, in the Vancouver release, launched Now Assist for our four flagship product lines which is ITSM, HR, customer service, and Creator. So let's start with that, and those are all resonating whether our customers want text-to-code or text-to-workflow capabilities, or they want their employees to be more productive, or they want their IT staff or customer service agents to be more productive. So, depending on the customer, and what they solving for, all of them are resonating really well. So this was driven mainly on Pro Plus, but these were Pro customers, who also bought Pro Plus. So one example, one of the customers who did buy this on September 29th, specifically, said to me, hey, CJ, you know, we had the most successful ITSM roll-out. Now, we want to buy Pro Plus, and they're on ITSM Pro already, and we just want our employee experience to be great, versus another customer that Bill mentioned, they said, not only we want to solve for our employees, but also our end customers. So these four specific transactions were across the board, resulting in very strategic and significant wins. As we move forward, I would tell you that what is still resonating with our customers is the speed to value. This is not something where now large language models need to be fine-tuned for one customer at a time, and the way our engineering team has implemented this solution, I can tell you, Generative AI is probably one of the best, if not the best complement I have seen to ServiceNow platform, where you can use generative AI to look up something to summarize something, and then you take action via ServiceNow platform. Gregg Moskowitz : Fantastic. Thanks, CJ. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Hi. Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Bill and CJ, I was wondering if you could just talk about the concept of starting to deliver AI solutions that are more vertically oriented. How far away are you from that? How much of the verticalization do you want to take on, and how much do you want to leave to your partners to sort of take some of these use cases with GenAI into verticals with specific vertical technology? Thanks. CJ Desai : Thanks. So, first of all, Kirk, thank you for the question. When we start, and you know, yesterday we had our Board of Directors meeting and similar question was asked, we're first prioritized on our core set of use case that cut across every single industry. We are very focused on that, we are ITSM customer service, HR, as well as our Creator offerings. As we look forward though, there are specific use cases within financial services or healthcare types of customers or even government. So, I'll give you an example. Some of our public sector customers, they asked us, hey, CJ and the team, can you provide us a solution, that can potentially run on-prem, given the nature of that agency, and our engineering team delivered that for our public sector customer. So, I would consider that as a vertical solution, that we had to create, for our public sector customers. But as we take it to the next level, post this core set of use cases across our four workflows, we will definitely be prioritizing financial services and TMT moving forward. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Congrats on another great quarter. Maybe just two quick ones from me. Clearly, you know, the story of this quarter was the unbelievable Federal growth that you guys posted. Maybe ex-Federal, to the extent of the incremental challenges, or lack of thereof from the macro and pipeline, like, what's the story of the quarter ex-Fed, and then some of the deals that you guys referenced either on the Pro Plus side, or just a very large deal side, like, maybe talk a little bit about the competitive environment? Are you taking them away from some of your front office peers, or kind of how does that shape up as you look at the pipeline? CJ Desai : Yeah, Alex, thanks for the question. This is CJ. First of all, you know, yes, Federal had a phenomenal quarter, and it's been talked about by both Bill and Gina, but we also saw strength in certain industries, and certain geographies across the board. We won't be able to produce these kind of results, and this kind of beat on cRPO with our strengths in other industries and other geographies. So that's what I would say at the highest level that there were a lot of other strengths, and even from a use case or a workflow perspective, Bill already outlined, that our employee workflow, which is now customers are asking us this question that we want our employee productivity to be high, and what is ServiceNow's solution because employees waste too much time swivel chairing or looking for information, so we saw significant growth there, but the growth was across the board, given from a workflow perspective as all four workflows grew very, very nicely. And Alex, you know, how much I pay attention to that. The second thing I would say on Pro and Pro Plus, what we are seeing is that customers understand ServiceNow strategy is very specific to ServiceNow use cases. And one of the things that I realized after having this Pro Plus conversations with customers on a large sample size that, generative AI or our Pro Plus SKU is a productivity multiplier. It's not a productivity enhancer. When you have a productivity multiplier, and you can articulate what kind of productivity gains they will get, that is when they say, okay, we got it. And now, let's forget what are the pricing, and other things. So, competitive dynamics wise, from a generative AI standpoint for overall this Pro Plus SKU, it is still in the context of ServiceNow. How much value will they get, how fast will they get that value, and how much they're willing to pay. Bill McDermott : And, Alex, if I may build on what CJ said, I can give you some additional color, if you like. One thing that might be of interest to you is in Americas, the number of $5 million plus deals actually more than quadrupled year-over-year, and the number of $10 million plus deal doubled year-over-year, and I think as CJ laid out beautifully, technology and employee workflows were enormously successful. And in EMEA, our 1 million plus deals grew 70% year-over-year now, which means that the platform and multiple components of the solutions that our great engineering team builds is resonating, and we're seeing particular uplift now in government and manufacturing. And one interesting fact. We have these world forums coming up in London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Rotterdam, and we have 1 billion plus pipeline that's registered for those events. So, we feel good about that. And APJ, when you think about it, 1 million plus deals increased 40% year-over-year, and Japan is continuing to impress us with the unprecedented opportunity of the world's third-largest economy as Germany is as well. So, we're seeing lots of real growth opportunities on the global stage, and I think Gina pointed that out earlier as well. Alex Zukin : Super insightful, guys. Thank you very much. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Thanks, Alex. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Alex. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Brad Sills : Oh, great, thank you so much. Looks like an uptick here in headcount this quarter, sales and marketing hires net adds, looks like more than 500 R&D, almost 400. Would love to get some color on some of those areas of prioritizing -- that you're prioritizing in the investment, both in sales and marketing and R&D. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah. Brad, listen, this is a tale of continued execution. We've been very focused on adding heads and investing in our R&D resources, and our quota-bearing sales. And so, you will continue to see us invest in those critical areas for us, and that's been something that we've been doing for quarters now. And so, we'll continue to add the quota-bearing sales, the direct sales folks, as we enter into '24. You could expect to see similar levels of growth as we enter the following year. So feel really good about where we've been investing in those same areas that we've been talking about. Quota-bearing direct sales heads as well as critical key engineering as we think about the great innovation that comes from our R&D and engineering teams across the world. Brad Sills : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Turrin : Hey, great, thanks. I appreciate you taking the question and fantastic job with the Q3 results. Gina, you gave us some 2024 mile-markers at the Analyst Day earlier this year. It's now October, a lot's changed, but the growth profile is proven impressively durable throughout. Is there anything you're seeing that's meaningfully different here today versus where things were in May? It sounds more clear in terms of some initial value you're seeing from the GenAI capabilities, but there are there other swing factors we should keep in mind understanding Q4 is very important, but anything you can add is useful. Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah, you know, Michael, thanks for the question. We don't provide formal fiscal year guidance until next quarter. That said, given our increase in revenue this year, we remain ever confident in the goal that we put forth back in May at Analyst Day for 2024 as well as 2026. The strength of our underlying business does provide solid momentum, and the potential for upside heading into '24, but as you said, Q4 is a big quarter for us. We expect great things, but it has a significant impact on next year. So, we'll wait for the formal guide, but feel very, very confident in the numbers that we laid out for you back in May, and stay tuned as we head into '24. Michael Turrin : Well said. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Michael. Operator : We'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hey, Gina. I actually wanted to follow up on that. I had a different version of that question which is, just more precisely on GenAI when you gave -- when you gave the outlook at the time of the Analyst Day, there's, obviously, already a lot of discussion about AI with the products that have been rolled out, so when you gave the '24 targets, does that embed any potential impact from GenAI specifically, or was that something that was just on the horizon, or on the com that wasn't included, just for clarification. I've gotten that question a lot. Gina Mastantuono : Sure. Yeah, Samad, great question. As you recall, at Analyst Day, we actually showed a lot of live demos of the work that we were doing around generative AI. We talked also about the fact that we're not jumping on this AI bandwagon, but we've been investing in AI for years and years and generative AI was part of that. So as you think about our roadmap and our plan, GenAI was part of that. Now, that being said, the interest, and the understanding, and the excitement about GenAI today versus back in May is extremely exciting to us. And so, if your question is, is there potential upside as a result of GenAI, absolutely, but one quarter does not a trend make. So we will absolutely continue to keep you posted on the adoption rate of our GenAI SKUs, but we are extremely excited about the pipeline build that we've seen already, and it's just been out for a very short amount of time. And yeah, so more to come on where GenAI goes for us, but rest assured, ServiceNow is going to be a winner in the GenAI space, and we're extremely excited about pipeline build, and where we are today. Samad Samana : Great, and Bill, if I could squeeze one in for you, you've talked about how much interest and buzz that's been generated, and how it's increased the velocity of conversations. When you think about your Board-level conversations, are you seeing that the budget that's being carved out for spend on GenAI, is that being taken away from other parts of the overall IT budget, or is that, hey, this is a strategic imperative, and we need to find the money, whether we're growing our IT budget or not? Just how are they thinking about that -- those dollars and where they're trying to grow? Bill McDermott : Yeah, Samad, the CEOs all have Boards of Directors, and they don't want to show up without a GenAI plan. So, this is a CEO-level decision, and I think that is why we meet with so many CEOs and the C-Suite is now completely embedded in the ServiceNow go-to-market plan, and it's working beautifully. What they are doing is as follows. According to IDC, the IT budget this year would have been about 3.5% spend, and next year, it's expected to go to, instead of incrementally increasing 3.5%, which is your typical year, it's expected, according to IDC, to incrementally go up 7%, and that's the IT budget itself. What I believe is going to happen, and based upon the CEO discussion that I'm having, and also based on my own way of thinking, I would very much like to take the position of looking at the world through the customers' eyes, and on them, 7% may or may not get it done. I might look to G&A functions to further fuel this generative AI revolution because this is really about business transformation, and truly transforming the way you run your company, and it's not a nice-to-have IT project. I do think that is one of the -- interesting question you have because, I think it's one of the reasons why I have said repeatedly the IT strategy has become the business strategy because digital transformation is an end-to-end imperative now generative AI across platforms that matter, and is only a few and we are one of them is really to me, going to get a very nice tailwind investment in 2024 regardless of the macro. Samad Samana : Great. I really appreciate you guys taking my questions. Thank you. Bill McDermott : My pleasure, Samad. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Samad. Operator : We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Derrick Wood : Oh, great, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, either for Bill or CJ, but I was hoping you could expand on your new AI Lighthouse program with NVIDIA and Accenture. You guys announced this initiative a couple months ago. It'd be great just to get a bit more color on the undertakings around this program, and how these particular partners are helping to drive more kind of generative AI investments on the ServiceNow platform. Bill McDermott : Yes, Derrick, you know, I'll start off, and then CJ can build on it. I'd like to first acknowledge NVIDIA, in particular, has been such a great partner, really taking their fantastic GPU technology, and then working hand-in-glove with them on fine-tuning these large language models, especially beginning in IT, but even more recognized that one of the great brands, and great companies the world is using ServiceNow, to transform their company on our platform with generative AI is such a complement. And so, I just want to say thank you, Jensen. Thank you, NVIDIA, for being a great partner. And yes, with regards to Accenture, and Julie and so forth, we are really doing some great things with Accenture. They are a fantastic partner, and we're building now generative AI use cases across 300 different customers with our ecosystem, and that doesn't even touch on the broader pipeline. CJ can give you some detail on exactly what we're doing, but I really do want to say that, I am incredibly appreciative of our partners, and I want to thank our partners for recognizing that we're a good partner, and it takes a good partner to know one, and we have really built foundational trust with the ecosystem and I appreciate them all, and I think that is another tailwind effect that we're getting because I believe we're moving into a world of not just intra-enterprise, but inter-enterprise business network opportunities, and I believe our platform in generative AI will fuel a completely new frontier of solutions, and offerings, and the global economy, and I think that this is only just begun. I just want to really give you that as a thought because we'll have more to say about that in the future. CJ? CJ Desai : Absolutely, Bill. Right on. And, Derrick, you know, one of the things with this Lighthouse program that we were solving for is, have a great technology partner, and Jensen and the team are a great technology partner. Most of the -- most of us know NVIDIA as a great GPU provider among other engineered systems. But in this specific program, what most do not know is that NVIDIA's software team is working very closely with ServiceNow's engineering team, to really innovate on generative AI, and that is a very important point as part of this Lighthouse program is the engineering collaboration between NVIDIA and ServiceNow and a software layer, which, obviously, that pushes the hardware in the right direction. And then, when these customers, we talked about the four customers, there have been many, who start using this product, as they need to get adopted, besides Accenture, there will be other partners that we are also training, enabling so that they can implement really, really fast the solutions that come out of ServiceNow. So overall, this is a holistic strategy, engineering collaboration, and as Bill said, ecosystem collaboration, so that we can deliver the value for our customers. Customers' demands are high on the value that we will deliver, and we need great set of brands, technology, and system integrators to deliver the craft. Derrick Wood : Thank you for that color. Operator : And we have time for one last question. We'll take that question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg : Oh, great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. CJ, a question for you. A lot's changed in the observability market with the Splunk proposed acquisition. I'm curious, could you give us a sense for your positioning in the cloud observability market? With Lightstep and other advancements there, how well-positioned do you feel to gain additional share there? Thank you. CJ Desai : Absolutely. So, you know, I would say observability is still fundamentally a big market. It's a big market that continues to grow. We started with Lightstep, and as you are aware that they provided a great solution for tracing, and with OTL as an OpenTelemetry, they had done some phenomenal work. Then we added the metrics capability, and just end of September we finally added logging capabilities. So now we feel that we have a full-blown cloud observability solution that we can take to the enterprise market, and we will compete head-on what the types of use cases, that we need to, with whoever we need to, and that's how I look at it. So, I'm optimistic. We have a lot of work to do. Finally, the product is there, full-blown cloud observability product between metrics, traces, and logging, we are ready to go. Thank you, Matt. Operator : And that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Goodbye.",

ServiceNow closed an outstanding 2023 with a beyond expectations Q4. Here's the state of our business. Artificial intelligence is injecting new fuel into our already high-performing growth engine. The company's Q4 results tell that story. Subscription revenue grew by 25.5% at constant currency, that's 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. cRPO growth is 23% at constant currency, also 200 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 29%, that's approximately 200 basis points above our guidance. We had 168 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, up from 126 a year ago, a 33% increase. ServiceNow's Q4 performance is packed with milestones spanning the full breadth of our portfolio. With technology, customer, and creator, we now have three workflow businesses over $1 billion in ACV. We have 11 individual product lines with north of $250 million in ACV. ITSM, ITOM, and ITAM, each had double-digit deals over $1 million in Q4. Security and risk combined for 12 of the top 20 with nine deals over $1 million. Customer, Employee, and Creator workflows, each had double-digit deals over $1 million. Our large new logo count continued to accelerate in Q4. We had a record 10 new customers signing deals over $1 million in NNACV, including a $10 million win with a very large global financial services firm, which is our largest new customer logo in history. Global iconic brands such as Chipotle, Air France, TIAA, NTT, Data Group Corporation, and Busch are digitally transforming with ServiceNow. We are proud that TIAA, one of our first 10 customers, is still expanding their business with us through new out-of-the-box functionality so they can accelerate time-to-market. Following a record Q3, public sector continued its strong growth in Q4 with key wins including in the United States Army, US Postal Service, and Australian Department of Defense Digital Delivery Group. We are extremely proud to have finished 2023 operating at the rule of 55 plus. As you'll hear from Gina, our 2024 guidance reflects our ongoing belief and ServiceNow's strategic relevance. Our core business is rock solid and growing. Our perimeter is growing. Our platform adoption is growing. We are, in fact, in a new era of business transformation powered by AI. This is unlocking massive opportunity in the enterprise software industry. And ServiceNow is extremely well-positioned, not only to lead this movement, but to define it. 2023 was the latest successful milestone on this journey and we intend to make 2024 an even greater success. To say we're fired up would be an understatement. Let's spend some time framing the dimensions of this new AI world. Gartner estimates $5 trillion in tech spending in 2024, growing to $6.5 trillion by 2027. That means that spending will grow another $1 trillion in only two years, accelerating from the decade plus it took for us to get to $5 trillion. For the first time in a decade, IT services will become bigger than communication services in 2024. Gartner estimates that by 2027, nearly all of the growth in worldwide IT spending will come from software and IT services. And when you drill deeper into the Gartner forecast between 2023 and 2027, $3 trillion will be spent on AI. What we have here is a strong, durable market being supercharged by a once-in-a-generation secular trend. ServiceNow has been investing, innovating and preparing for this wave for years, which is why we're catching it so early. We have a long track record of commercializing breakthrough technologies. When our Pro SKUs were introduced, we saw very exciting traction and customer adoption. Our Pro Plus offerings, which we launched just four months ago with our Vancouver release, are outperforming the pace of the Pro upgrade cycle. Exciting. The results in our first full quarter since launch validate this trajectory. Siemens AG is using Now Assist for HR service delivery to resolve HR cases faster for its entire global workforce. This is one example of many and as always, ServiceNow's strength and our capacity to deploy net new innovation, especially our ambitious Gen AI road map. In Q4, we released significant new capabilities, Virtual Agent Update drives faster issue resolution through advanced conversational AI chat. Employees get the immediate answers they need. Businesses get higher self-solve rates, and it only takes 15 minutes to set it up. Our text to workflow capability dramatically increases developer productivity. ServiceNow's developers have been using text to code for several months. They are generating high-quality code using text to describe the type of code they want. This has increased our developer innovation speed by 52%. Now Assist for field service management reduces cost, while increasing revenue by helping technicians get the job done in the first visit; identifying the necessary equipment, providing repair recommendations, and automating follow-up at speed. Beyond the platform itself, we see AI as a 360-degree strategic imperative. It's why ServiceNow joined the AI Alliance to advance open, safe, and responsible AI. It's also why we are continuing to grow our strategic partnerships to ensure every enterprise can use AI as the cornerstone of business transformation. Today, we expanded our strategic alliance with EY to co-create solutions for generative AI governance for our customers. And of course, EY will also be using ServiceNow's generative AI capabilities to enhance experiences for all of their employees. We also unveiled another major expansion to our partner program, the latest addition in a series of investments as partners are building new business models on the ServiceNow platform. These are two examples of many. I've told ServiceNow's team worldwide that the company is now moving into Phase 5. The culmination of our long-term goal of surpassing $10 billion in ACV, which incidentally only a handful of software companies have ever achieved. We have so much runway ahead for the long-term growth of this company. There are two key elements of our strategy, execution and scale. Execution, we know is an art form. Scale is all about capitalizing on new opportunities as a truly global platform company. One of those in our market making alliance was Visa. Today, ServiceNow and Visa announced a five-year strategic alliance to transform payment service experiences. In the initial phase of the alliance, the companies will launch ServiceNow Disputes Management built with Visa, a single connected solution for dispute resolution. This Gen AI-powered solution will offer end-to-end dispute resolution for customers globally, everything from the first indication of a questionable charge through early investigation to final resolution. Another example is our growing partnership with AWS. Beginning this month, ServiceNow will be available as a SaaS offering in the AWS marketplace. From an automation perspective, we have long believed that identifying legacy process challenges is an active stimulant for new workflows. That's the beauty of our platform. The architecture gives us limitless ways to accelerate speed to value for our customers. And the more workflows we drive, the more value we create. That's why we tucked in UltimateSuite, a task mining company to enhance intelligent automation across the Now platform. If we can help customers find it, ServiceNow can fix it. And we fix it in complete harmony with any existing software landscape, delivered in a consumer-grade user experience. CEOs don't want to wait another decade for technology to finally deliver on its promise. One told me, I'm tired of excuses coming into my boardroom. We need new innovation and new experiences, and we need it now. That's obviously music to our ears and nicely on brand for ServiceNow. There's plenty more to discuss about the company we are building and the progress we're making. We have more accolades than time to listen to them. Top analyst firms ranked ServiceNow as a leader in 14 separate reports in 2023 for our automation and AI capabilities. Glassdoor's recent US Best Places to Work lists ServiceNow as Number Three overall and Number One in software. One of our proudest achievements is the American Opportunity Index. This index is databased. They study what really happens to employees at America's largest companies over time. ServiceNow scored Fifth, and that's out of 400 companies overall and ServiceNow was the Number One technology company on the index. That means that people who have fought hard to build a great company are being rewarded with a great life. This all means so much to us because culture is the glue that binds a winning team together. We have world-class professionals at ServiceNow who care deeply about our customers and our partners. Since Fred Luddy invented the company, we've all made our contributions to help ServiceNow emerge as the hungry and humble winner it is. We believe in our platform. We stick together and we try to have some fun along the way too. That's why the results show up the way they do. It's also why over 1 million people applied to work here last year. To all of our shareholders who continue to invest your trust and ServiceNow, we thank you, and we've got you back. We're building a masterpiece here, and we're only getting started. 2024 will show that we're putting AI to work for the world because now, as ever, the world works with ServiceNow. I look forward to the questions and the discussion we'll have shortly. In the meantime, I'd like to turn the call over to our outstanding Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Happy New Year to all of you who are listening in. Q4 was another exceptional quarter to conclude what has been a phenomenal year. Once again, we exceeded our topline growth and operating margin guidance metrics, showcasing our team's relentless focus on execution. ServiceNow's agility in responding to enterprise needs has solidified our position as the trusted intelligent platform for driving digital transformation. In Q4, subscription revenues were $2.365 billion, growing 25.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. We closed out 2023 with $8.68 billion in subscription revenues, also representing 25.5% constant currency growth. All organic at a scale that hasn't been accomplished by any other enterprise software company. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $18 billion representing an acceleration to 27.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. cRPO was $8.6 billion, representing 23% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 200 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities, business and consumer services, and education were particularly robust in the quarter. Government control continued to show impressive growth and Telecom, Media, and Technology also saw strength. As Bill noted, I'm pleased to announce that customer workflows crossed $1 billion in ACV in Q4 fast following our Creator Workflows, which hit that momentous milestone in just Q3. We now have three workflow categories generating over $1 billion in ACV, highlighting the breadth of our portfolio. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 99% in Q4, continuing to demonstrate the strategic relevance of the Now platform as it remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We ended the year with over 8,100 customers with our focus on landing the right new customers continuing to bear fruit as large new logo growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. We ended Q4 with 1,897 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. We closed 168 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year, that includes five deals over $10 million. And for the full year 2023, we saw an approximate 30% increase in deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. In Q4, our Gen AI products drove the largest net new ACV contribution for our first full quarter of any of our new product family releases ever, including our original Pro SKU. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin exceeded 29%, approximately 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by the topline outperformance and disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 55%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. For the full year 2023 operating margin was 28% and free cash flow margin was 30%. Total free cash flow for 2023 was a robust $2.7 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $8.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q4, we repurchased 400,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have $962 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability, and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. We are raising our 2024 outlook to reflect the strong momentum with which we exited 2023. This partially reflects the early success we've seen with our Gen AI products as those investments are accelerating the build of our already robust pipeline with customers lining up to be first movers in this next wave of business transformation. As always, we continue to be prudent around our assumptions for incremental customer budgets and the macro cost in our guidance. With that in mind, let's turn to 2024 guidance. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $165 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.555 billion to $10.575 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, reflecting investments in our data centers and emerging growth opportunities, offset by 100 basis point benefit from a change in useful life of our data center equipment from four to five years resulting from an assessment completed earlier this month. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 28% to 29%, driven by continued OpEx efficiencies. We expect free cash flow margin of 31%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, overcoming an incremental point of cash tax headwinds. Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 208 million. For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $2.510 billion and $2.515 billion, representing 24% to 24.5% year-over-year growth or 23.5% to 24% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects the tremendous strength of our federal business, which has resulted in a higher mix of 12-month contracts that will create a negative 150 basis point impact to Q1 cRPO growth. We expect that these contracts will renew in Q3 as ServiceNow's federal contract renewal rates are 99%. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect 208 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, ServiceNow's Q4 outperformance is another example of the strength of our platform and our people. This team's amazing accomplishments in 2023 set the stage for continued success in 2024. ServiceNow is positioned as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation, has gained momentum throughout the year, leaders are shifting their investments into proven strategic platforms that leverage the power of AI to deliver growth across the top and bottom lines, with customers prioritizing quick time to value the Now Platform delivers. The accelerating pace of investment in workflow automation and interest in Gen AI positions us well on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill, CJ, and I would like to extend our gratitude to all our employees worldwide for their outstanding contributions to ServiceNow's success this past year. 2023 was a remarkable year, and we look forward to an even more exciting 2024. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad, your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks very much and congrats on an amazing finish to 2023. Bill, it's clear that Now platform is a destination of choice for enterprise AI and modern digital workflows. But I'd love to hear your view of the environment versus what you see is Now specific. It would be great if maybe you can share a bit about close rates, sales rep participation rates or even the net new ACV performance as you did last year, just to help us contextualize how it's going out there. Thanks. Bill McDermott : Yes, Brad, thank you very much for the question. Things are going very well out there, and the momentum is terrific. What's really happening and I can say this after 186 CEO meetings in the last six months, the CEOs are now getting very involved with the Gen AI revolution. They realize there has to be architectural adjustments to their environment and the manner in which they manage their data and the platforms they're beholden to actually take advantage of Gen AI. And if you think about the half a century mess that exists out there with legacy systems, in many cases, multiples of the same system, we have one unifying force in these conversations, which is the Now platform because we cooperate with the complexity of this landscape without putting people in a position to rip and replace. So, they're looking for platforms that matter. We're one of those and I think as Gina said, we are the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. When you have that C-level executive meeting, they really get it now and with regard to Gen AI, the momentum is outstanding. As I said, that SKU has outsold any other new introduction we put into the marketplace. So, there's a real appetite to invest in Gen AI, and there's no price sensitivity around it because the business cases are so unbelievable. I mean if you're improving productivity, 40%, 50%, it just sells itself. So, I think we're in a really, really good place. The Gen AI investments are coming. We're actually getting orders because we have great product, thanks to CJ and his unbelievable engineering team. So, I would tell you at this time last year, compared to this time this year, you should be more bullish now. Brad Zelnick : Yes. And it's great to see it reflected in the guidance. Thanks so much for taking the question. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Brad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark, the floor is yours. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. So, Bill, I don't think I've heard any other software companies say that its Gen AI products produced the strongest net new ACV of any product family. We had a contact saying it's really the only platform with real-life uses of AI right now. So, I'm wondering if you think that is accurate, and that's what's driving it or should we relate it more to the work you've done getting ahead on pricing and packaging? Should we think back to the efforts of that element AI team, which is so fantastic or maybe it's some other factor in your mind that's really allowing you to see faster adoption of AI? Bill McDermott : Yes, I mean, I'll obviously let CJ comment on this also. But you look at the Visa strategic partnership using Gen AI solution to manage end-to-end dispute resolutions with customers. I mean this is one of the great brands in the world, one of the substantial companies. And just think about the impact Gen AI has in a radically simplifying their conversation with their customer and deflecting all the human capital it takes to resolve these cases when technology can do it. If you look at EY and the idea of instilling Gen AI governance on a single pane of glass to manage risk and compliance for some of the biggest corporations in the world. If you look at the opportunity, every single industry has a great opportunity. I was in Germany recently, and I was talking to a home appliance industry participant. Post-COVID, they went from 25% online sales to much more than 50%, and it's growing. So, when CJ and his team brought Field Service Management with Gen AI to the marketplace, just think about one call where the agent instead of -- the rep instead of using a clipboard and a pencil, he's got it on the mobile, knows exactly what part to bring, resolves the case on the spot. That's one part of it, but here is another part of it. The consumer will pay a lot more if they can get a same-day repairs agreement along with the appliance. And the margins on same-day repair are far greater than the box itself, plus you create a nice annuity stream. So, what we're talking about here is fundamentally rethinking the way business is transformed using our platform and Gen AI. And CJ, I know, and I do want to congratulate you and thank you for the job that you continue to do, bringing this innovation to the marketplace. Please give us your thoughts. CJ Desai : Thank you, Bill. And Mark, here is how I would say some of the questions that you asked are absolutely spot on. Element AI team was absolutely a game changer from talent perspective. And our investments in AI, that you're very familiar with since 2017, continue for us, not only on the speed of innovation, but what we learned from our customers. Let me give you a couple of quick insights. We were the first ones -- one of the first ones to release the product with use case specific generative AI starting in September. So we definitely had first mover's advantage from that perspective. However, from a customer sentiment perspective, I will tell you there were two Wall Street banks telling me specifically that they wanted to be the first ones on the Street, Wall Street in New York, to go with our Gen AI solution and one of them signed with us. And you work for one, but in the sense that this is a highly regulated environment, regulators want to know how AI is done, and we were able to sign with the first Wall Street Bank in New York in Q4. In addition, we also signed with a large manufacturing company that wants to fundamentally transform their employee productivity. And then we also signed with a very large restaurant food retailer who wanted to transform employee experience and overall shared services productivity so that their margins can go up. This is definitely a game changer. We are learning a lot from our customers. We are seeing very significant momentum and I was here when we launched 2018 September, ITSM Pro, and as Bill and Gina shared that this has exceeded all of our expectations on how well we did on the monetization of our Pro Plus SKUS. Thank you, Mark. Mark Murphy : Thank you. Congrats on being so far ahead. Bill McDermott : Thanks a lot Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Your line is open. Arjun Bhatia : Perfect. Thank you guys so much and I'll add my congrats. I wanted to maybe touch on the strength that you're seeing in customer and employee workflows because if I look at the net new ACV that you're driving there, the mix is relatively stronger than IT workflows there this quarter. Is that attributed to some of this AI adoption and plus SKU? Or are there other drivers there that you're seeing driving momentum in those solutions? Bill McDermott : Thank you very much, Arjun, and I really appreciate it. Just a couple of statistics on the customer workflows, 18 of our top 20 deals, what we're seeing is there's a tremendous opportunity to really take ServiceNow and squarely place it on the Customer Relationship Management category. When you think about front, mid and back office and the fact that we can align all three of those things, and nobody has to lose for us to win. We could fill in all the blanks for what the current participants don't do, especially with their integration problems. It's just a fantastic opportunity for our customers. And I think it's important to note, when I gave the Field Service Management example, our net new ACV in Field Service Management, specifically was up over 50% and year-over-year. So, I think it's important to recognize that we have a whole list of new logos in this space. And employee workflows, nine of our top 20 deals and was kind of interesting. Every single CEO now is looking to make the people packed far more productive than it is and with natural language to have your employees seek the data and the information they want and have it reported back to them in just a very nice paragraph of content and data so they can do their jobs better, is kind of like in the no-brainer category. And we have some really great logos that I'm sure CJ would like to share with you as well. But both of those areas are really good. And incidentally, that employee spot that I mentioned was up 80% year-over-year. CJ Desai : Thank you, Bill. And Arjun, some of the questions that you asked, you're spot on. So, AI and specifically Pro Plus SKU was a catalyst, both for our employee and customer workflow. So, that's number one. Number two, within customer workflow, which had an amazing quarter, and I'm so proud of that team and ServiceNow to cross $1 billion which just a few years ago was $10 million. That's a multiple orders of magnitude growth on the difference we are making in customer service because we are ServiceNow, and we know how to do customer service. So, ServiceNow growth was unbelievable from customer service and customer workflow perspective. Two sectors, I'll call out besides Bill's point on Field Service Management. Number one, our telco products, specifically designed for telco industry, saw triple-digit growth with some of the largest telcos in the world related to customer service. And also, we saw in public sector from a direct to citizen perspective, Customer Service Management Did really well in Q4. And on employee workflow, as Gina outlined, we had many million-dollar deals across the industries, including public sector and that business, in addition to HR service delivery with workplace service delivery and legal service delivery, continues to do very well, growing very strongly. Arjun Bhatia : Great to hear. Thank you, CJ, thank you, Bill. Congrats again. CJ Desai : Thank you so much Arjun. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open Kash. Kash Rangan : Congratulations, Bill, Gina, CJ. Great to hear that you're among the first sort of software companies to give us splendid results and we feel better about 2024 already just based on your numbers. Bill, a question for you. It looks like generative AI making sales cycles easier, if I could say that, and has the potential to bring in repeat business with existing customers at a faster pace and magnitude. Can you talk a little bit about how much easier it has gotten despite the environment staying tough, but for generative AI, how much easier has it gotten for the company to generate that initial lead and close that deal and do more repeat business? That's it for me. Thank you. CJ Desai : Hey Kash. So, I will touch on this from a couple of things. demand environment, as Gina has outlined, it continues to be still tough, right? We are not ready to say that things have improved significantly. It is our platform's strategic relevance, as Gina called out, is very high, which has allowed us to what you saw million-dollar deals and large deals that happened in our Q4 across the globe, across the industries, the performance was very strong. So, let me just touch on that. On generative AI the demand for generative AI varies by industry, but we are -- I'll give you an example of a large manufacturing company, the CIO reached out to me in October, wanted to do a four weeks POC and purchase it in December. So, from a sales cycle perspective, that was a top-down decision moving very, very fast. A large retailer is currently also doing a proof of concept with ServiceNow Pro Plus SKU because it is a CEO initiative that Bill talked about. So, from a demand on Gen AI specifically, it is very, very clear that customers are pulling us in that direction in certain industries. And for those sales cycles, yes, they are very fast. They want to see a large manufacturing company CEO that Bill met in Germany, I had a follow-up call in December, and he said, CJ, I want to kick off on Pro Plus SKU for the specific use cases on ITSM. And you and I should review the results end of February. This is faster than ITSM Pro sales cycle. And so I would say overall environment is still similar from what we saw in Q3 to Q4, and Gina will touch on it, but Gen AI, it's on a faster cycle. Bill McDermott : Yes. May I also just add one thing, Kash. If you think about every single industry, they all have their own personality. So, for example, I had the opportunity to meet a pharma company. And as you know, the average life cycle, for example, for clinical trials is over six and a half years. And this is an industry that drops $200 billion a year on this clinical trial process and 90% of them fail. So, if you just think about that for a minute, you say, well, what can generative AI do to automate document generation, for example, that would be in line with regulatory protocols and you come up with site contracting agreements, for example, that also include the patient, because the patient has to be engaged in the process, otherwise, they won't stay in the trial. And every time a patient opts out, they lose money, $20,000 per patient. So, generative AI on the ServiceNow platform obviously can go in there and radically cut down the cycle-time of these clinical trials. So, CEOs right out of the gates are ready to go. Your team, my team, let's figure this out. So, there's a real appetite. And I think why I'm so bullish is we have a platform that already has it. Kash Rangan : Amazing. Thank you so much. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith, the floor is yours. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys and again, congratulations on really strong end to 2023. I wanted to talk a little bit on the expense side of the equation. You guys really outperformed nicely on the operating margin side of the equation this quarter looking for further expansion next year. And looking at sort of where you guys are hiring, I was a little bit surprised to see more strength on the R&D side of the equation than sales and marketing. Sales and marketing headcount is only up 6%. So, you talk to us about sort of that relationship changing a little bit. R&D headcount is almost matching sales and marketing head count right now. If we went back five years ago, sales and marketing was 50% ahead of R&D. So how are the investment priorities changing now, especially as we go to 2024? And how are you guys feeling about sales capacity and sort of the necessity to expand sales capacity heading into 2024? Gina Mastantuono : Hi Keith, this is Gina. Thanks so much for the question. So, yes, we're really proud of the beat on the topline as well as the bottom-line in Q4 and obviously continuing to expand those margins in 2024. Specifically, when you think about investments in R&D head count, it's all around continued innovation and our investments in Gen AI and AI. And so not surprising given the commentary that you've already heard, we're continuing to double down in investments on fingers on keyboards, engineers really driving the Gen AI revolution. So, you'll continue to see more of that. On the sales side, it's really about scale and leverage, right? And so sales and marketing head count, there's a lot in there. It's not just quota-bearing feet on the street sales, right? So, you've got marketing, you've got marketing operations, you have sales operations in there. If you actually were able to break it down to feet-on-the-street quota-bearing sales, you would see that growth rate much higher. And in fact, as I think about sales capacity going into 2024, we have a larger increase in ramped reps going into 2024 than we've had in years. So, from a capacity perspective, we feel great about how we're entering 2024. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Gina Mastantuono : Awesome. Thanks for the question Keith. Keith Weiss : It seems like it really speaks to an increasing sales efficiency then. You just need less people to support any given quota-bearing sales reps. Gina Mastantuono : Absolutely. Productivity and efficiency is going up as well as the fact that from a scale perspective, you're not growing some of the operational heads as much. Keith Weiss : Got it. Super helpful. Thank you guys. Gina Mastantuono : And we'll be definitely increasing hiring as we go into 2024 as you would expect. Bill McDermott : And Keith, Gina doesn't brag about this, neither does Russ Elmer, who is our Office of General Counsel lead. We're using the Now platform. So, in all the back office functions of the company, we're so automated, so productive. And they're getting things done on the Now platform that it would take other companies five and six times the headcount to do the same job. And that is really something. We actually even had with legal service delivery, AI tell us that we're spending too much time on contracts less than $250,000. Our office of General Counsel, Russ made the decision based on AI that we could fundamentally change that and reorient the workflow around those kinds of agreements, which gave us a huge rush, and he didn't have to hire anybody. And then he actually took that product and our great engineering team built it. We call it LSD, Legal Service Delivery and now lawyers all over the world, they want to jump on. So, everything we do internally with Now on Now as an external marketing force associated with it. CJ Desai : Yes. And Keith, Gina handled this really well in terms of sales efficiency. But one of the things that Bill mentioned that I just wanted to call out that we are really proud of our sales teams besides expansion of our platform in different buying centers, but also the new logo growth. The new logo growth for 2023 was way ahead of what our expectations were specifically in Americas and Europe compared to 2022, including the large transaction that Bill referenced. But when your sales capacity and sales efficiency specifically is improving, while you're also gaining new logos, which is just a very super proud moment for us in 2023. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad, your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, thanks. Congrats on a great close to 2023. Gina, I was wondering if maybe you could help us understand that on the cRPO upside, if you think about the 200 basis points and could you kind of break down for us how much of it was adoption of Gen AI and the net new ACV that, that drove exceeding expectations versus just kind of more strength than expected on the renewal cohort and what drove -- what's the mechanic of the upside was in the quarter? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, sure. So, we beat our Q4 cRPO growth guidance by 200 basis points as you know. And I would say it's driven probably half and half by net new ACV outperformance and certainly, Gen AI is in there, but it's not all Gen AI. So, our core business is also doing well. And then we also did see higher early renewals than we had assumed in our guidance. And I would say it's about half and half of the total beat. Samad Samana : Great. And then, Bill, this is maybe for you or for CJ. But as you think about the product portfolio and some of the newer products you've talked about over the last year or so beyond Gen AI's observability or ERP workflows, where are you seeing the most demand or interest outside of Gen AI? And what are you most optimistic about in 2024 beyond Gen AI? CJ Desai : Absolutely. So, Samad, here is what I would say. In general, every single workflow grew for us on net new ACV, which is always a great thing that, that's a balanced performance across every single workflow. And so really proud of the team, both our go-to-market and engineering teams that we continue to deliver innovations and our go-to-market teams, they know how to sell that innovation across our product lines. So, that's number one. Number two, when I look at some of our industry products that I called out, specifically for TMT as in telco, media and tech, they are seeing very nice traction. We also released in our technology workflow under the leadership of Pablo Stern, operational technology product that also grew very nicely. Bill called out Field Service Management, Customer Service Management had an amazing not only Q4 but 2023, and then employee workflow also grew. So, as I'm walking through this list besides Gen AI and then I can tell you the same thing about security, risk, and so our asset management had a phenomenal 2023. So, I expect all these product lines to continue to have momentum besides generative AI. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex, the floor is yours. Alex Zukin : Thanks guys. So, first of all, congratulations on a fantastic quarter. And I think the amount of conversation about Gen AI and the tangible impacts of it on the model and the quarter were really great to hear about and see. I just -- I wanted to dig in a little bit to see if you could dimensionalize further either from a revenue contribution kind of cRPO or bookings contribution in the quarter or attach rate that you're seeing with Pro Plus as you go to market? And how should we think about that for fiscal 2024? What's the aspiration here for Q1? Just give us a better -- I'd say, a better indicator or something that we can kind of monitor and track where we can see the Gen AI penetration going forward? And I have a quick follow-up. Gina Mastantuono : Sure, Alex, it's Gina. What I'd say is and we called this out in my script, right? At the end of the day, Gen AI products drove the largest net new ACV contribution in the first full quarter of any of our new product family releases ever, including original Pro SKU. So, I get the question often, do we the adoption curve to be steeper for our Pro Plus than our Pro. Certainly, in the first full quarter of launch, it absolutely has shown that. That being said, it's very early days. And so from a revenue contribution perspective, it's not going to be huge, but it's certainly helped when I thought about my guide for 2024 and that increase of $165 million at the midpoint, right? So Gen AI, early days, but the adoption curve so far is steeper than the original Pro. We will keep an eye on it. And as the numbers get larger, we will continue to update you and everyone else as to the penetration. But right now, excitement and interest from our customer base is much stronger than we ever saw in the first -- in early days of our Pro SKU, and we're excited by that momentum at the same time being conservative as I think about the guidance for 2024 because it's still so early. Alex Zukin : Super helpful. And then I guess, if I think about just the opportunity around or actually just cRPO linearity throughout the year, you talked about the headwinds in the first half. How does that trend through the second half of the year? And then what other things should we be paying attention to there? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So, we called out the 150 basis point impact in Q1 that increases to about 200 basis points in Q2, so we expect similar levels from Q1 to Q2. I'm not going to guide out any further than that at this point. But what I'll tell you is that I increased the full year 2024 guide by $165 million. We remain as confident as ever in our guide of $15 billion plus in 2026. And Gen AI and the innovation in our -- all of our product portfolio is going to help drive that growth. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you guys. Congrats again. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Alex. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Co. Your line is open Mike. Mike Cikos : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here and I'll echo my sentiment as well along with my peers. I just wanted to come back, I think earlier during the Q&A, CJ had kind of teased and maybe the monetization here for the Plus SKUs relative to the Pro SKU exceeding your expectations. And just wanted to make sure I was interpreting that properly. Can you give us any indication for what that price capture is like relative the Pro SKUs which we've had out in the market now for a couple of years? CJ Desai : Yes. So, Mike, first of all, the Pro SKUs, as you know, that we launched it in 2018 Q3, so we have five years of consistent trajectory and measures on how we did on Pro across ITSM, CSM and so on. And that we shared at Financial Analyst Day in May. Gina shared that number that we got 25% uplift. When I look at Pro Plus, first, just to underscore what Gina said that it definitely exceeded our expectation, did really, really well and the fastest growth. We have launched so many products over so many years. This definitely exceeded our expectations. So, that's number one. Number two, just simple thing. When I'm looking at what, based on the volume discounts, customers leaning in, asking us to try out from POC, POE perspective, it is in line with what my expectations were on how we would get the price uplift. So, right now, as Bill said, I did not get any, Oh my God, CJ, this is not going to work for us, where is the value. We have to always earn our right and deliver the value for our customers. But right now, it is in line with my expectations. Mike Cikos : Terrific. Thank you very much guys. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Mike. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl with UBS. Karl, the floor is yours. Karl Keirstead : Okay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to Bill and CJ. You both mentioned ServiceNow's largest ever new customer win with the bank. I guess I'm surprised that there's big bank out there that's not already on ServiceNow, but I'd love to hear a little bit more about that, and I'm not even sure how big a deal would have to be to be your largest new win? So, any size and color would be fabulous. Bill McDermott : Yes, I think we were -- I think, Mike, you called it. I think we were at 23 out of 24 of the world's largest and most significant ones. And now we're at 24 out of 24. And I just seriously want to credit the amazing platform of ServiceNow, the MRA process and integrated risk management and the complexity of going into an environment like that is pretty serious stuff. And to have a marquee brand trust us and believe in us and believe in ServiceNow the way they did is really inspiring. And I really have to turn it over to CJ and give him so much credit for the hard work that he put into it. And I know firsthand because I had the front row seat to watching it and how we spent time with this wonderful customer. And CJ, I'm sure you got some color that you might want to put on that. CJ Desai : Yes. Karl, great to hear from you. I would say fundamentally, when I look at that particular financial services institution, 100% is true that it is on our core of the core. So, from an IT service management perspective, IT operations management perspective, this is not generative AI-specific deal, but it was very much a very strategic transaction on the foundational platform for automation and digital services at this large financial services institution. It is the largest new logo win that we had there, and it is in eight-figures of net new ACV. So, that is material. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Congrats on that. Bill McDermott : Thank you very Karl. Appreciate it. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Karl. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. Joel, the floor is yours. Joel Fishbein : Thank you for taking the question. I will also echo the outstanding execution you guys have done. Bill, I guess this is for you. Just around the public sector vertical, it's been very strong for you for several quarters. I guess two things. Number one is, how is the spending remain subsistent, it used to be very cyclical there? And the second question around public sector is, what do you think their AI adoption cadence is going to look like from your perspective? Bill McDermott : Yes. Well, thank you very much for the question. I really appreciate it. Our federal business is really outstanding. And for the benefit of our shareholders, I think that there's a tremendous opportunity to replicate what we're doing in the United States federal and many other governments around the world. That is clearly an ambition that we have, and we have many use cases and many references to back that up. So, CJ, I think you spent a lot of time with our team. And I know that I mentioned some of the names like United States Army, United States Postal Service as an example, really marquee wins, really, really important stuff. Why don't you build on that? CJ Desai : Yes. So, Joel, everything that we have seen, as you saw in 2023, consistent performance in our what we call global public sector. So, let me start there. US Federal, we highlighted the strength in Q3, followed by some of the logos that Bill discussed. However, I do want to state that we are also doing really well. Our platform is for state and local governments in the United States and that growth was also very inspiring in 2023. So not only US Federal, but also US state and local. Now, let me take an example for Q4. Besides United States, we also did really well in public sector in United Kingdom. On Bill's ask and our customers' ask, I spent some time in London with our public sector customers, and they continue to also leverage ServiceNow for similar use cases that we have seen in the US Federal. And then in Q4, our Australia public sector team also did really well, and we had significant platform expansion with some of the large central governments their agencies, including generative AI. So, it is a pretty good picture. And we see in 2024, besides these nations. When I look at Canada, when I look at Germany and many others, the opportunity remains large, as Bill called it out. Joel Fishbein : Great. And just as the follow-up on the public sector adopting AI. Can you just give us a little color on what you think the trajectory is there? CJ Desai : The trajectory, so I just want to make sure that you understand, first is that our Gen AI conversations have started with the government. One of our first logos in Q3 was with a large public sector agency, as I call it. We also had a few wins in Q4 in public sector. And as we go into 2024, across state, local and federal, across countries, we will continue to see the demand. It's early days. I would say, compared to like a financial services or manufacturing and others. But given our position of our platform and the strength we have with AI, we are definitely going to see in the second half adoption of generative AI. Joel Fishbein : Great. Thank you so much. Bill McDermott : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Peter Weed from AllianceBernstein. Peter, the floor is yours. Peter Weed : Thank you and congratulations on the major continued momentum and wins that you are seeing with the latest releases. And I guess building on that, I'd say, prior to this year, for several years, I think there have been some really nice stability in kind of expansion in NRR or customers that I think Gina had and really comforted. But I think this year, there has been some deceleration in that driven by macro. As you look out to 2024, do you see signals that we may be able to see some acceleration where NRR in 2024 might exceed what they kind of dipped to this year or is this kind of like the new normal and kind of from here, things may continue to trend down? Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Peter for the question. What I'd say is that we are -- we feel great about our expansion rates at the scale that we're at as well as on new logo growth. So, CJ mentioned earlier, our new logo growth, especially in our larger customers, has been an accelerating each and every year and each and every quarter over the last several years. And so at our scale, our expansion rates remain extremely strong, and as does our net new logo growth. And so you will continue to see a nice mix of existing customers upselling with us as well as new logos joining us. And so we hit $8.7 billion in revenue going to $10.575 billion next year. At our scale, these expansion rates are best-in-class, and we remain extremely proud of them. Operator : We have time for one more question. And that question will come from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Brad, the floor is yours. Brad Sills : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about the large new logo strength. We just haven't heard from a lot of enterprise applications companies around that this year. It seems like a tough environment to close big transformational new application deals. So, I wanted to ask why now? I know this has been a focus, but any color on where you're at in kind of closing that gap on some of these large global organizations? And then also, what does that mean for your expansion opportunity, does this give you more line of sight to that given that these are large organizations with big wallets just getting started with ServiceNow? Thank you. CJ Desai : Yes. So, Brad, I will touch on it. Besides financial services institution, we also saw many large new customer wins in manufacturing, specifically automotive. We also saw in public sector. We got new logos with new agencies and commercial business which is a massive strength for ServiceNow continue to outperform large new logos. And in my initial commentary, I stated that Americas and Europe also had large logo, new growth. So, this is something that Paul Smith and the team focused on starting with the first quarter and continued to build throughout the year. And as I told, Keith Weiss, this is something we are really, really proud of in terms of just our ability to focus on high-quality logos that matter. And even these logos, whether it's in public sector, manufacturing, financial services or our commercial segment, it's not that we have maxed out. Even this large financial services, they just bought ITSM and ITOM. When I look at a large automotive, it was just ITSM and ITOM. So, yes, we are starting at a bigger scale, but this specific account will continue to expand for us. And one last thing I'll touch on that some of the big ones who became our customer for the first time, our teams did a beautiful job working with the customer that, hey, once you implement, say, ITSM in the next six to nine months, then they have set aside budget for IT asset management or for security or risk. So, that has been also built in as we go into 2024. Brad Sills : Thank you, CJ. Great to hear. Bill McDermott : Thank you, Brad. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks Brad. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Darren Yip, Group Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Darren Yip : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer. During today's call, we will review our first quarter 2024 results and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2023 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William McDermott : Thank you very much, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. ServiceNow's first quarter results were outstanding. We once again outperformed our guidance across all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue grew by 24.5% year-over-year in constant currency. That's approximately 50 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency, 100 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 30%, 150 basis points above our guidance. Even as Q1 is not traditionally a large quarter, we had 8 deals over $5 million in net new ACV, a 100% increase year-over-year. 4 deals were over $10 million, which is a 300% increase year-over-year. ServiceNow is strengthening its position as the AI platform for business transformation. This is fueling strong performances for each of our key businesses. ITSM and ITOM were each in 16 of the top 20 deals. Security and risk, combined, were an 11 of the top 20, customer creator and employee workflows were in 10 of the top 20 deals. GenAI adoption remained on a tear in Q1. Companies are leaning into GenAI as a powerful deflationary force to drive productivity. That's why NNACV for Pro plus is record-breaking. In fact, it's the fastest selling offering in the company's history. Iconic brands are adopting ServiceNow's Now Assist AI as a standard for their GenAI road maps. This quarter, we expanded our long-standing partnership with Microsoft to include new generative AI capabilities while also integrating Now Assist AI and Copilot into employee experiences. Really exciting. Hitachi Energy is using case summarization with Now Assist for ITSM to resolve cases faster, saving millions. Equinix is deploying Now Assist AI for HR workflows, aiming to increase agent productivity by 30%. ServiceNow at IBM are combining the power of the Now Platform with Watson X to increase productivity for IBM's employees, customers and partners. BNY Mellon and ServiceNow are exploring the utilization of AI and other leading technologies and IT service management helping to unlock additional value for the bank and its clients. We look forward to further demonstrating the exceptional GenAI customer successes and a detailed road map at our Financial Analyst Day on May 6 in Las Vegas. From an industry perspective, public sector continues to excel globally. Major transactions in Q1 included government of Australia's health department and the government of Italy's IT division, Sogei; the government of Sao Paulo Motor Vehicle Department created an app on ServiceNow to give customers, in that case, citizens, a fast, transparent digital experience that handles requests in minutes. Our global footprint is booming. We're seeing a vast expansion in our most important geographies. This quarter, our Japan team signed the largest NNACV deal in its history. Novartis in Switzerland is implementing ServiceNow GenAI technology to transform the business into one of the most innovative companies in therapeutic medicine. NEOM is harnessing ServiceNow single data model along with other partners to scale its IT services across the Middle East regions while seeking to create the first cognitive city where data-driven intelligence meets urban everyday needs. Suzuki, Tokyo Gas iNet, ANA Systems are all top deals signed in Q1. And this is just scratching the surface of what we achieved this quarter. There's a lot of guesswork out there right now about the geopolitics and economic policies among other things. ServiceNow's philosophy is simple. We focus on the things we can control, building great products, delivering great service for our customers and forging a winning culture, where people can do the best work of their careers. And that's why we perform well when some others don't. It's also why our guidance, as you'll hear from Gina, remains ever strong. Let's talk about the demand environment for enterprise software. AI is not simply a fast maturing technology. AI is a catalyst for business transformation. When I speak to CEOs all over the world, they recognize this is a change moment. Over the past 15 years, enterprise has experienced a massive decentralization of technology governance. As every department became an IT buyer, the result was too many systems, too many apps, low data quality and high vulnerability to cybersecurity risk. And here's the key. Those decisions have been made. So even as CEOs want to consolidate on to strategic platforms for the long term, they also don't want to delay the potential of net new innovation in the short term. They want to derisk the past while getting immediate business value from AI. Process optimization is the #1 GenAI use case in the global economy today. This is why ServiceNow's strategic relevance as the AI platform for business transformation has never been higher. Every business workflow in every enterprise will be engineered with GenAI at its core. We are the single pane of glass that enables end-to-end digital transformation. At ServiceNow, we pride ourselves on being the living embodiment of an AI run company through our Now on Now strategy. Every week that passes the impact of our own Now on Now AI deployments continues to grow. GenAI deflection rates have doubled for both our employees and customers, and they are improving each and every month. Software engineers are accepting 48% of text-to-code generation. These are meaningful productivity improvements, and it's only the beginning. That's why IDC estimates an $11 trillion impact from AI in the next 3 years. It's also why businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on GenAI in 2027, according to IDC. So contrary to some opinions out there, we are witnessing the biggest enterprise software market opportunity in a generation. Business leaders are waking up to the fact that they have a fresh choice now. They can radically simplify the tech stack. We are entering a new frontier. We are in a race to put AI to work for people, and that's a race ServiceNow intends to win for our customers. There's a lot happening at ServiceNow that only heightens our optimism for the remainder of this year and beyond. Our recent Washington, D.C. platform release included very exciting new features for our customers. Now Assist AI for ITOM AIOps supercharges ServiceNow's market-leading solution, applying generative AI to speed up issue resolution. Sales and order management unites the sales order life cycles across the front, middle and back office teams on the ServiceNow platform. ServiceNow is also staying at the forefront of building innovative enterprise GenAI applications. As one example, Now Assist AI for Telecommunications Service Management, what we call TSM, which also uses NVIDIA AI, will boost agent productivity and build on our great partnership. It's also worth noting the ServiceNow research team is stacked with world-renowned AI experts helping our customers stay on the cutting edge. We're expanding our ecosystem capacity to meet growing customer demand. One example is our investment in platformation, a global IT consultancy and leading ServiceNow implementation partner to enhance expertise and generative AI-enabled technology. And anyone who'd like to get the full story, I warmly invite you to join us for Knowledge 2024 in Las Vegas on May 7. In closing, I'll end how I began, the company is in a market-leading position. We have the product recognition from the industry analysts. All of them were showing up on all of the most admired company lists and we're moving up the ranks every year. Those things are always encouraging, and we're proud of it all. But the biggest indication I can give you is qualitative. It's how our team feels about what we're doing together. This culture is different. It's rooted in ServiceNow's earliest days as a customer-obsessed company. We are ever-hungry, ever-humble. So when I'm told that over 1 million people applied to join us last year, I'm not surprised. When you have a galvanizing ambition to become the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century, people want to be a part of that. They recognize this is about more than technology. This is about helping people to know more, care more and do more. We'll continue on this mission in Q2. I'd like to thank all of you for the trust that you've invested in ServiceNow. We're going to keep working hard for you, and we're going to keep striving to honor our brand promise. The world works with ServiceNow. I'll now hand things over to our outstanding CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q1 set a strong precedent for the year ahead. Building on the momentum from Q4, our team delivered another exceptional outperformance. We surpassed all of our top line and profitability guidance metrics for the quarter. With GenAI conversations serving as a digital transformation catalyst, we see that momentum carrying into Q2. Turning to our results. In Q1, subscription revenues were $2.523 billion, growing 24.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by approximately 50 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $17.7 billion, representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We continue to see average contract terms increase year-over-year as the strategic importance of the Now platform has driven longer duration deals. Current RPO was $8.45 billion, representing 21% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was extremely robust, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Education had a fantastic quarter, growing nearly 50% year-over-year. Transportation and Logistics, Business and Consumer Services and Retail and Hospitality also saw strength. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98% as the Now platform remains a strategic imperative for our customers' operations. We closed 59 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter with 4 deals greater than $10 million, representing 300% year-over-year growth. Our focus on selling a comprehensive platform continue to drive more multiproduct deals as 15 of our top 20 deals included 7 or more products. We now have 1,933 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. In addition, the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew over 50% year-over-year. In Q1, our GenAI products continue to see very healthy adoption. As Bill mentioned, our Pro Plus net new ACV to date continued the trend ahead of any new product family launched for the comparable period. Our GenAI products were in 7 of our top 10 deals, and we closed 7 deals over $1 million in ACV in the quarter. We had wins at a second Wall Street bank, a leading cybersecurity firm and many more, including a significant win for ITOM Pro Plus, which just launched in March. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 30%, approximately 150 basis points above our guidance, driven by the timing of marketing spend, OpEx efficiencies and our top line outperformance. Our free cash flow margin was 47%, up 12 points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $8.8 billion in cash and investments. In Q1, we bought back 225,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $787 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. In Q1, we initiated a program to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated revenues. The initiative is expected to lessen the impact of recent movements in the euro and pound, but the incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar has still resulted in FX headwinds compared to our previous guidance. Given our Q1 outperformance, we are raising our 2024 top line outlook to more than offset those moves. For 2024, we are raising our subscription revenues by $20 million at the midpoint of the range to more than offset an incremental $17 million headwind from FX. This raises a net increase of $3 million on a narrowed range of $10.560 billion to $10.575 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, operating margin of 29% and free cash flow margin of 31%. Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 208 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $2.525 billion and $2.530 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 22% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20.5%, both on a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 25%. Finally, we expect 208 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q1 was a great start to what we expect to be another tremendous year. Organizations are under more pressure than ever to maximize the benefits of the technology investments. In this environment, ServiceNow's traction as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation continues to intensify. GenAI is only as powerful as the platform it's built on. The Now platform gives us deep insights with the remarkable ability to tailor AI outputs to the specific needs of our customers. Business users need AI to power actions across the enterprise. Our workflows are designed to do just that, deliver complete solutions to supercharge experiences, creating extraordinary value. You'll hear more about these experiences, our strategy and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 6, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I want to thank all of our employees worldwide for helping make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 Best Places to Work yet again in 2024. ServiceNow's greatest asset is its people, and you all continue to make us, ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this incredible team. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kasthuri Rangan : First earnings report and software for the year, Bill, good to see the optimism. My question on AI is at what point does AI get more broadly adopted, at least from a sales cycle standpoint, that despite the tough economic environment, you can actually draw in more potential prospects into the category because of the cost savings here. And one for Gina, I noticed that -- it's still too early in the year, cRPO, RPO, a bit of seasonality there. Can you give us some insight into what to make of the rest of the year? Congratulations. William McDermott : Thank you very much for the question, Kash. As I said, process optimization is the single biggest GenAI use case in the enterprise. And any process that exists in the enterprise today will be reengineered or engineered depending on how messy the process is with GenAI. So every workflow in every enterprise will be rethought. So just think about the sales process, for example, and the whole order to cash process, for example, or think about employees and onboarding and training them and providing all the services to them. Think about agent productivity, which is something that we're obviously moving very quickly on where you can bypass the systems that don't integrate very well. And instead of swivel sharing around or putting customers on hold or I'll get back to you tomorrow, have real-time data where most of the cases are deflected from virtual agent. But if an agent is involved, they have choice A or B, which one is more pleasing to the customer. Okay, you like B, you got B. And the case is closed. Think about managing complex cases across an enterprise where all those screens are open and data is being processed instead of having spreadsheets and workarounds and e-mails and text. Now you have everything done on one platform with full case information and case closure. So literally, from running a business in every department to building software, like I said, with the breakthrough on natural language tech turning into code. Every single enterprise will run completely differently because of GenAI and because of our clean sheet platform. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. And Kash, on your question around seasonality about the cRPO. So first and foremost, really proud of the fact that we beat our guide in Q1 by 100 basis points. That beat was twofold : one, strong net new ACV growth as well as higher early renewals. And so from a seasonality perspective you'll remember, we talked about the Fed duration. And so Q2 is slightly more impacted, right, before it pops up again in Q3. And so we feel really good about the trends that we're seeing. And again, feel really good. We continue to be prudent in our guide around early renewals, while we are seeing them stronger than we saw last year. Again, from a guidance perspective and a forecast perspective, we're continuing to be prudent there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Karl Keirstead : Bill and Gina, maybe even CJ. I wonder if you could just comment on the environment that you're seeing. I think in prior quarters, you've described it as after a pretty rough, call it, year stretch, it started to stabilize in 3Q and stabilized again in 4Q. Was that still the case in Q1? Were there one or two verticals that maybe lag? Maybe some of the puts and takes about how the environment broadly felt. Chirantan Desai : So I would say, Karl, I would start first is environment, and we shared this in January, Bill, Gina and I, it remains pretty much the same from our perspective as it -- and what we mean by that, it is not 2021, specifically. So it still takes many approvals and all the things that we discussed from a sales perspective in trying to get business validation done or a purchase being made. And pretty much, I would say, that's a standard across industries and geographies. We are absolutely executing well within that environment given our promise of efficiency and automation so that is absolutely resonating and combine that with our in-platform generative AI, which also resonates really well because that is an accelerant to the productivity enhancements that an organization can take. So whether it's Wall Street banks, whether it's a life sciences corporation, whether it's governments, that story of automation, digital, productivity, enhance via GenAI is absolutely resonating and that is what is helping us, despite the environment continuing to be the same. William McDermott : And I would just build on that, Karl, just for your benefit on the budgets themselves. The budgets are going up. And what I definitely see is the preference for GenAI now. I think we're ending one era in the enterprise, and we've begun another. And we're into a new frontier now where GenAI has opened up the eyes of the customer to say, there might be a different way of doing this. And that's creating real opportunity for us. So CJ has it exactly right on the value-based economy, but also I do see the budgets not only going up in IT, but also just see GenAI becoming more of a business imperative. And if you can increase productivity, take cost out and show that in a value case this money that will be spent and maybe different people approving it, but the money will be spent. I also want to acknowledge some really great partnerships that we've achieved with Microsoft and IBM and NVIDIA. And I look at great companies like Novartis really rethinking the whole pharma process altogether with GenAI. There's just so much goodness going on in this market. And I feel that you're coming off a strong Q4 to have a great print like this in Q1 with the momentum going into knowledge. I don't think I've ever felt this good in the 5 years that I've been here than I do right now on this call with you right now, absolutely the best I've felt. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew Hedberg : Bill, given your comments on Pro Plus net new ACV growth, are you seeing faster Pro Plus deal cycles relative to what you saw when the Pro was first launched? And anything you just need to call out from a discounting perspective on Pro Plus relative to maybe some of your initial expectations? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Matt, I'll take that one. So yes, we are absolutely seeing faster Pro Plus adoption versus Pro. It's 2 quarters out, right? So it's early days, but we feel really good about the adoption curve. And we've been talking about whether or not that adoption curve would be faster. And we posited that it would be, and that's certainly proving out to be the case, although again, early days. With respect to discounting versus initial expectations, we feel really good about the realized pricing and it has been very much in line with our initial expectations. And we'll talk a lot more as you would expect at Investor Day about the overall GenAI opportunity for ServiceNow as well as where we are to date. But we feel very good about what we're seeing in the markets. Customers are really leaning in. We talked about 7 deals in the top 10 had GenAI in it, significant deals over $1 million as well. So we're definitely seeing monetization happening already. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Bradley Sills : A question for Gina, please. Real nice results on RPO. I think this is the second quarter since we've seen significant outperformance there versus cRPO. Just curious what's driving that? And does that give you some visibility perhaps for cRPO to ramp from here given perhaps a ramping component in there? Gina Mastantuono : Yes, it's a great point, and I did call that out. So RPO growth was 27% year-over-year in constant currency, which is 300 basis points improvement versus last year. And yes, that is our longer-term backlog. So as you think more longer term about the opportunity in ServiceNow, I couldn't be more excited about that. We are seeing the average duration growing. And in fact, duration this Q1 is the largest it's been in the Q1 since, I think, 2019. And so I feel really good about what that means for the mid- and long-term opportunity here for sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh : Sanjit Singh in for Keith Weiss. Bill, I wanted to ask a little bit about GenAI adoption within ServiceNow, you mentioned Now on Now, but in terms of just like the GenAI adoption, both broadly and with the engineering team, it looks like you're hiring for this quarter in R&D, you kept a pace. How is GenAI adoption changing or not changing your hiring plans more broadly and specifically in the engineering team? Chirantan Desai : This is CJ. And here is where I would say that specifically, we absolutely believe, and we have seen it that GenAI is helping our software engineers code faster. I mean, straight up. It helps us our software engineers code faster, whether they are junior software engineers or very senior software engineers, they still can leverage and continue to leverage generative AI. So I'll start with that, that is increasing our engineering productivity and it varies depending on how senior the engineer is or how junior the engineer is. And number two, it helps us increase our innovation velocity. So that is really, really important to us that it increases our innovation velocity. When I flip that for our customers is that when customers leverage ServiceNow generative AI, and if they can do automation faster, whether he's using text to code or text to workflow types of use cases that they can not only increase the number of workflows that they put on ServiceNow, but second, it also increases that digital efficiency. So it's both ways. Our engineers are able to innovate faster and then our customers are able to workflow faster because of generative AI. William McDermott : And one thing just to share with you, Keith (sic) [ Sanjit ], we have 20 -- 20 GenAI cases on the Now on Now story within ServiceNow. And our Chief Information Officer, Chris Bedi, put a very interesting LinkedIn post out there. Please take a look at it. Not only is he doing a great job. But if you think about ServiceNow, we have a financial system in ServiceNow. It's a system of record. We have one of them. Unlike many customers out there that have hundreds, we have a CRM system. We have one of them. And we have an HR system. We have one of them. But they are feeding the ServiceNow platform. So all the data from those systems of record in terms of how we run this company, we run the whole company on ServiceNow. And now we have 20 different GenAI use cases across all the departments of the company. So my full expectation is that someday, we could do the earnings call where we're all in this room together and we'll take you through the living, learning lab of a GenAI-run company here at ServiceNow. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. And I would just add -- I think I would just add, we are absolutely customer 0, 100% on all of our GenAI use cases. Deflection rates have doubled for both our employees and customers and they're improving every month. Right? It's really early days. So it's learning faster and faster. Software engineers are accepting 48% of text to code generation. So there's absolutely the ability to see leverage in our R&D as we look to the mid- and long term. So thank you for the question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : I have two questions, but I'll ask them as one. First, Gina, I don't know if this is for you or not, but acknowledge that the adoption does seem quite strong for the various GenAI offerings, and so how would you characterize? And yet you're pointing to decelerating growth through 2024. So what's not growing as well? If GenAI is getting great adoption, probably small dollar amounts contribution. But what's not growing as well? And the second part is perhaps going to come at the Analyst Day, but is there any specific metrics you could give us on dollars of ACV or anything else related to the GenAI SKUs? Or should we wait for Analyst Day perhaps to some more specific indications on what the adoption is? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So we'll definitely give you a lot more details on all things GenAI at Investor Day, and that's in a week and a bit. So stay tuned there. Yes, the adoption curve is stronger than we've seen in any new product category launch, but that's starting from 0, right? So it's a small dollar at this point in time, but the speed at which it's going to grow to be a really meaningful contributor is faster than anything we've seen. And so what I'd say is that 24.5% revenue growth at the scale at which we are, the larger numbers is pretty incredible. And we see continued traction across the board, whether it's our technology workflows, our customer workflows or our creator as well. And so really across the board, employees had a really strong quarter, customer had a really strong quarter. ITSM core remains healthy in 16 of our top 20 deals, 10 deals over $1 million. ITOM was included also in 16 of the top 20 deals with 9 deals over $1 million, security and risk in totality, still doing well. And so it's the great thing about having a platform with the breadth that ServiceNow has, that we continue to drive really, really good growth at our scale across the platform. Chirantan Desai : Yes. And the only thing I would add there is every single workflow continues to still grow double digits plus, plus. So we have no, hey, this has been taken out of x or this been taken out of y besides Gina individually calling out all our growth vectors, whether it's our core, which is ITSM and ITOM or whether it's our growth, which our CSM and other products, AppEngine, part of creator and customer, all of them continue to grow very nicely, and they grew very nicely in Q1. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. Tyler Radke : I wanted to ask you how you're seeing the momentum just in terms of Standard to Pro migrations. We talked a lot about Pro Plus, but it would seem that still a huge opportunity in terms of, I think, close to 50% of the installed base on Standard. Have you started to see an acceleration in those migrations? Can you just talk about the opportunity there? Chirantan Desai : So first, I'll use, Tyler, one quick example that I was in a conversation at a bank, very technical audience in their technology organization. They were still on ITSM Standard. Once they saw what we have done with Pro plus, they actually bought Pro and Pro Plus together. And that is just amazing that they bought both technologies together, not just saying, \"hey, I'm going to go to Pro and then staircase to Pro Plus.\" That's a very specific example. But the way we look at this specific product line, whether it's ITSM or whether it's CSM, our customer service, is I look at both Pro and Enterprise in total. So when I look at Pro and Enterprise in total, so I'm excluding Pro Plus on purpose here, so Pro and Enterprise, which are the bigger SKUs at a higher priced amount, they grew nicely for ITSM, for CSM, for our HR Service Delivery. Three of our anchor businesses, when you combine Pro and Enterprise, that is still a high-growth business and then you add Pro Plus, that's what allows us, at this scale of $2.52 billion to grow at 24.5%. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg Moskowitz : Bill, getting back to the topic of IT budgets as it relates to ServiceNow broadly, you took a sense of how much of GenAI software spend is incremental today as opposed to perhaps coming from other areas of IT. William McDermott : Yes. It's a really important question, Gregg. I really believe the IT budgets in their own right will go up on a standard rate basis as we've seen now for many, many years. The business executives, however, are inserting their will into the generative AI revolution because the CEO is in a boardroom with her senior team sitting around a table with the Board of Directors, and they're like, \"hey, what are you guys doing on GenAI?\" And they know now that they got to go into that room with a story because this is a lot like when we had the internet, then we had the iPhone moment, everything went mobile. Everything is going GenAI. It's just a question of how quickly you get there. So I believe that a lot of the business operating spend will be moved to GenAI technology use cases that serve the business. And the reason I believe I'm right on that, if you look at great companies, some of them in this quarter like Microsoft and Novartis, so Hitachi Energy or Equinix or IBM, they're looking at this as, hey, what does this mean to my employees, to my customers, to my partners and they're very well aware of the fact that inflation is sticky and rates are high, and they're on their own. They've got to deal with this stuff. And the only way to change the game is to rethink the game and move from checkers to chess and GenAI is now opening up the window for transformational conversations. And that's why I say we are the AI platform for business transformation because we're using technology to transform the business, how can the business run at a lower cost. They're asking questions like, why am I on several different releases on-premise and in cloud and why do I have all these systems? I need a system for every 1,000 employees, it's ridiculous. So they want to rethink things. And so I think there's two things that are going to happen : one is business budget is going to move into the GenAI category, and it's not going to take away from the IT spend in the end; and two, there's going to be real winners and real losers. And real winners and real losers has already begun its formation because if you don't plant the AI flag in the ground in the next 8 months, there's not going to be an AI flag to put in the ground and ours are getting put in the ground all over the global economy. And the company that I see out there doing extremely well in that regard is what Microsoft is doing with Copilot. And I see what we are doing with Now Assist AI. And I think it's the combination of those 2 players in the enterprise. And obviously, you've got the great ones like NVIDIA and so forth that's building the GPU force, but that is really what I'm seeing. And I'm also super honored this quarter to see IBM really jump in as a friend and a partner with ServiceNow, and we feel the same way about Watson X. And we're very open to all the participants that are making LLMs and they can all integrate with ServiceNow, and we'll own the domain specific to ServiceNow, but we welcome all participants. And I think that's another unique part of ServiceNow that we're not interested in shutting anybody out. We're actually technology capable enough to open up to everybody and that's really turning on the whole ecosystem in our favor. So plants are being put in flags in the ground in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all the way to Japan and beyond. We are winning. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. I do apologize. It looks like Mark has disconnected. We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : It's great to hear all the traction in international. You called out deals in Australia, Italy, Brazil. But I want to focus, Bill, on what you just mentioned about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where in your press release, you called out a $500 million investment in that market given obviously it's a massive, massive opportunity. Gina, can you double-click into the $500 million investment you're making over what time period, where it lands on the financials? And maybe more generally, how should we think about your strategic use of capital and CapEx for these types of deals? Gina Mastantuono : Brad, thanks so much for the question. So we're really excited about the investment in Saudi. And rest assured, that $500 million is a long-term investment over a long horizon period. It will be in -- most of that investment is in data center, so it will be in cost of sales, but you'll -- again, we manage our margin very tightly. And the growth that we're from that investment is huge. The opportunity that we see in Riyadh and Saudi, NEOM, is great. And Bill spent a nice time there at the LEAP conference, and we're really excited about really pulling our technology to really help that society grow and become a digital-first economy. And they're leaning in very heavy with ServiceNow, are really excited about our product portfolio, not only our GenAI, but really the breadth of the entirety of the portfolio. So it will be within our CapEx guide that you have always seen, it's not on top of, and we're just really excited about planning flags more in the Middle East. Operator : And Mark Murphy has dialed back in. We will go to Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Bill, I'm curious how you're looking at the onboarding of talent into the ServiceNow ecosystem because we're being told that the demand for ServiceNow consultants, is that a multiyear high. We're wondering if the economy can create those jobs quickly enough to keep up with the bookings that you're driving. And just also, is there a pivot point coming where you would want to crank up your own hiring engine within ServiceNow to keep up with the top line growth? William McDermott : Yes. First of all, Mark, thank you very much. Incidentally, my compliments on the research that you put out. I read your e-mail this morning and you called the quarter exactly as it was. So super well done on your part, not surprising considering the great company you work for. I will give you a couple of things. Leadership is everything. We just hired a great leader who is leading our training initiatives globally, both internally and externally, world renowned and she is going to drive not only a knowledge revolution within our own company but also within the ecosystem. And no, we're not going to build a services company here. We're very comfortable with the ecosystem and building out the ecosystem. We made a commitment with rise up with ServiceNow that we have 1 million people trained around the world on the ServiceNow platform, and we're well on our way to achieving that goal. I talked about platformation as one company that probably not everybody on this call ever heard of, but you know all the big ones, and they're all investing huge human capital contributions and some of them have literally multi, multibillion business plans built with ServiceNow. So we really like the fact that we can impact the customers' value case with our ServiceNow Six Sigma knowledge team and then we can extend the feet on the street through the ecosystem and also the trust that we have with the ecosystem where they know we're not trying to duplicate their business models on the contrary. We need them to invest in their business models to move our ambition to be the defining one forward. So it's a really good question actually. And you are right, we're working really hard at it, but it's also true for you to know that the partners see the opportunity like never before, and they're doubling down on ServiceNow. So we think we got a good formed strategy, and we think that we are going to be able to cover this global economy, and we're moving at warp speed to do so. Operator : We'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : I guess, Bill, I wanted to follow up a little bit to Mark's question because sales and marketing hiring in the first quarter was basically as many heads as you did the last 3 quarters of 2023. And I know there's some seasonality to it, but is that you guys ramping hiring back up as you see more demand? Is it a certain type of salesperson that you need as you think of more AI-driven sales? Just maybe help us understand what you saw in 1Q and maybe the philosophy around it. William McDermott : Yes. Samad, we see the biggest opportunity we've ever seen. And we know the GenAI revolution is real, and we're doubling down. What you're seeing our investments are very focused on building the best software in the world, and selling the best software in the world. So we have great leadership on both the engineering side and the go-to-market side and we're going to have more clarity of focus in the way we drive the go-to-market. Now we're getting to size and scale the calls for that. So there are various motions to market that will have single line of sight accountability and responsibility for a number and the accountability can't be stressed highly enough because we need leaders that can run businesses here. And that's what really big leaders want to do anyway. And Gina rightfully pointed out, we don't do anything without the margin in mind. So we have a pipeline. We manage the whole company on something we call the CEO of Dashboard. We are in real time with a rolling 4-quarter average pipe. We have our GenAI use cases that are against that pipe based on the stage of the sales cycle. So we know how many we can afford to hire based on probability of closure within 1% to 2%, and that is how we drive the financial performance of the company and how many people we let in the door. I do want to stress because we run a clean platform here and we run a GenAI company here. That's our absolute commitment. We are going to run a super efficient company. So on the G&A side of the equation, we continue to be lean and as we get bigger as a percent of revenue, that will drop even further. So I think you're going to like that. And I think a lot of companies now are showing up here at our doorstep, they want to see the Now on Now story because they're like, how is it that you could have one financial system for thousands and thousands and one HR system and one CRM system, when my company has hundreds and I can't even keep track of them all. And I think a lot of what I'm trying to explain to you is we're in the beginning stages of the end of one era and the beginning of another. Gina Mastantuono : And I would just add to that, Samad. I would just add that last year, might have looked like we slowed down sales and marketing, but there's a lot in that number, and we talked about this, a lot of operations, sales ops. And we actually were very focused even last year on continuing to hire quota-bearing feet on the street sales folks. We're entering -- we entered 2024 with the higher -- the highest increase in ramp reps that we have in a while. So yes, we will be reaccelerating. We feel really good about pipe. We feel really good about demand. And so -- but I want to make clear that we didn't stop hiring salespeople feet on the street. Last year, we continue to hire and we will continue to do that because our pipe looks strong and demand looks great. Samad Samana : Very helpful. And then Gina, I had a quick follow-up for you. On cRPO, you mentioned, I think, in response to another question about maybe some early renewals in 1Q. Can you maybe just help us understand if it was material enough to impact the Q2 guidance or just I know the guidance was good, but just trying to think through on that timing, if there's anything we should consider for 2Q and then maybe even the back half based on your expectations on renewals? Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So if you remember, Samad, last year, we've been -- over the last year, we've been more prudent in how we've been forecasting early renewals because it's hard to forecast. It's very customer specific and customer by customer. And so in Q1, our beat was really strong on our net new ACV growth, but we also saw early renewals than our prudent forecast. I haven't changed how we're thinking about forecasting. I'm still remaining prudent given the macro. And so as we think about seasonality. I talked about Q2 being lower, slightly lower, but then it bounced back up in Q3 when Fed is our strong quarter. And so again, it wasn't material enough to impact the Q2 guidance, but I'm not assuming better early renewals in Q2 like we saw in Q1. Samad Samana : Awesome. See you guys in a week and a bit. William McDermott : By the way, Samad, when you show up, you'll notice that it will be a stunning knowledge, and you'll see thousands more people than you saw last year. We just keep getting bigger and bigger. So get ready for the best Vegas show you've ever seen. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Patrick Walravens : Bill and CJ, can you help us understand how important it is to have and release your own LLM, so you guys had StarCoder in February, Databricks' DBRX in March? I'll just say Snowflake did their Arctic family. Chirantan Desai : I would say it is extremely important, Patrick, is the simple answer. Here are the three things we are solving for with our own LLMs. First of all, they are use case specific. And ServiceNow has many use cases that are used by our customers, whether it's IT service management, customer service, our ITOM, all of our key product lines. These are use case specific. And sometimes you would say, even for what Bill talked about agent summarization and other things or text to code, we always want use case-specific LLMs. So then the question is why. One, the accuracy is higher; number two, these are smaller models which are efficient to run, as you have seen, our gross margin guidance that Gina provided that we feel comfortable with the cost to run these models because when the models are smaller, the cost to run them is not high; and number three, from an end user perspective, a smaller model always performs better. So I consider this as a unique strategy that we are fortunate to have a great AI teams at ServiceNow, focused on not only the engineering execution, but combine that with research and experience on how our customers will consume Pro Plus, these things matter. And that's why domain-specific SLMs, small language models, is the right strategy for ServiceNow. We can run it in our cloud, customers' data is protected, and they have higher throughput and get higher value. Operator : We'll take our next question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. John DiFucci : Bill, you both talked about the strong government across the world and emphasizing international. I know the U.S. government is strong for you. And I suppose it's still pretty good for you. But Gina, you didn't mention it in the list of verticals that did well this quarter. Can you comment a little bit more on the U.S. federal government and what you expect for the rest of the year? Gina Mastantuono : Absolutely, John. Thanks for the question. I didn't mention it because we had such great results in so many other industries and sectors. But our federal business also was strong and had its biggest Q1 ever with $8 million plus deals and net new ACV growth that accelerated. And so we hosted our largest Fed forum ever with customers representing more than $1 billion in ACV and triple the number of attendees at our executive circle and over 35 partner sponsorships and so really strong federal business. And actually, our GenAI offerings are reinforcing our ability to help accelerate the transformation journey for our federal customers. And so we're seeing early adopters and healthy industry -- sorry, healthy interest in our domain specific models, which offer better security that CJ just talked about and really can drive tremendous efficiency gains. And so exciting themes ahead for 2024 and feel really good about what the federal business will continue to do for us as well as public sector as a whole. So thanks so much for the question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ethan Bruck with Wolfe Research. Aleksandr Zukin : This is Alex Zukin from Wolfe. Maybe just the question that you guys have gotten a couple of times on Pro Plus adoption. Listen, it's very clear that the enthusiasm is there, the interest level is there. You talked about it at length in terms of the new product launch being the fastest ever. Is there a way to kind of stratify? Or at a high level, just give us a sense for what percentage of your deals or pipeline either for Q1 included Pro Plus? And how it looks for the rest of the year? And how like that compares to your kind of expectations when you set on this journey? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Chirantan Desai : Alex, great to hear from you. So I'll take this on. So there are a couple of things we are seeing. So when we launched Pro in 2018 September, and we launched Pro Plus in 2023 September. As Bill outlined in his comments, the Pro Plus uptake by our customers is at a higher pace than Pro uptake was across not only just ITSM, but also CSM and also HR, which are 3 big product lines for ServiceNow. So when you look at exactly 2 quarters and 2 days that we have been in the market, it has exceeded our internal projections on what Pro Plus will do and our ability to sell them. And as Gina outlined, that not only it was in the 7 out of 10 deals, which are the top deals for ServiceNow in Q1, we had $7 million-plus deals, including public sector deals in a regulated environment where our engineers have made the technology work for this regulated environment. So overall, when I see what is happening on the demand environment, it is at a higher pace given very clear metrics around productivity for whether it's IT agents, customer service agents, HR staff, or for the employees. And that's what is driving the demand because it accelerates the productivity or multiplies it however you want to call it. The second thing I would say is when I look out Q2, Q3, Q4, I still see significant interest from customers, and they are saying, okay, CJ, what's going on with the customers who purchased this in, say, for example, Q4. Now here is a really positive news that I do want to report, and we will share more details at our Financial Analyst Day, Alex, is that customers are, for the first time very eager to turn on Pro Plus and want to see and work with us on where the productivity improvements they are seeing and say, help us understand, I saw that when a call got transferred from one IT agent to the other IT agent on follow-the-sun model, the quick summarization help them significantly, so they didn't ask the end user same question. So there are a lot of nuances we are learning as we work with our customers, but they are deploying. And when I say deploying, as in implementing Pro Plus at a much faster rate than Pro, which is allowing us and our sales team to use this as an example, while convincing other customers to sell. So overall, not only the demand environment I'm seeing is better for Pro Plus than Pro, if you ask me the same question in 2019 April, which was 5 years ago. But I'm also seeing that customers are turning on Pro Plus and working with us saying, here is where I'm seeing the improvement. Here is how I should think about it. And our engineering teams are doing a phenomenal job releasing improvements literally on a monthly basis to make sure that our customers are successful with Pro Plus. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Turrin : I appreciate you squeezing me in. Gina, 47% free cash flow margin certainly stands out, maybe walk us through the drivers of strength there for Q1. Anything onetime for us to consider? And maybe just given we're holding on to the margin guide for the year, just how we should think about seasonality of free cash flow throughout the rest of the year. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. Thanks, Michael, for noticing. We're really proud of the 47% free cash flow margin. Year-over-year, though, you have to remember that Q1 of last year was lower than normal given the Silicon Valley Bank and regional bank crisis that happened that quarter. All of that being said, even if you normalize for that, we are significantly higher. And that's testament to the strong margin, operating margin and some nice work that we've been doing on working capital efficiencies. And so we feel really good. Seasonality for free cash flow will be similar to what you've seen historically. And so just really strong results. The team has done an outstanding job on working capital efficiencies, and we'll continue to see that as well. Operator : And we have time for one last question. We'll take our last question from Derrick Wood with Cowen. James Wood : Great. CJ, just to kind of follow-up on that last discussion. Just in terms of how you're seeing adoption of GenAI. I guess on one end of the spectrum, perhaps it's easy to drop this into the hands of workers, let them experiment quickly figure out how to drive productivity. On the other end of the spectrum, perhaps there's a lot of data hygiene investments needed. You need SIs to come in and help drive real process change and really drive the learning curve. I guess where do you guys -- what end of the spectrum are you seeing when it comes to adopting LLMs within the ServiceNow platform? Chirantan Desai : So first of all, thanks for the question, Derrick. Here is how I would describe it. Our design goals and engineering goals were, this has to be super simple to turn it on, as in Pro Plus, once you are on Pro, and you can start using our Pro Plus capabilities, whether it's for agents, employees and so on. That has been our design principle. The setup is super simple, and customers are turning it on and seeing where they are seeing improvements on productivity, whether it's for agents or employees. So that's number one. Number two, I absolutely do not expect that this requires a heavy system integrator types of implementation that is drawn out in the old machine learning technologies, where you create a model, refine a model and you need data scientists, machine learning engineers and so on. This is pretty straightforward for ServiceNow use cases. Where system integrators can help is what Bill talked about that, hey, is there a new way to look at this process? And should I even put in another process on ServiceNow platform because I can see this is just super fast to get value out of ServiceNow. So in terms of implementation cycles, they are actually faster on Pro Plus than they have ever been before. And we don't expect a heavy implementation cost. However, if our customers want to leverage system integrators, the biggest value that they always had is helping them think through what additional generative AI use cases they can use and redefining processes. William McDermott : And Derrick, I would just give you one thing to think about, too. You could take great companies like Novartis, who want to be a global leader in their industry. And that industry has been held back with 6.5-year clinical trials. And these kinds of CEOs are rethinking everything and they're using generative AI as the gateway to change. And they're looking at not only GenAI, but they're also looking at ServiceNow as a fresh new platform design to take on some of the tougher process challenges that has slowed companies down. And as CJ said, which I think is a major point, the time to implementation on these GenAI use cases has been faster than anything I've seen, not just against Pro, but against anything. They want it in now. So there's an urgency and that urgency is coming from the C-suite, and it's a movement. And I've never seen a desire for implementation speed like I have for GenAI. And that, to me, is a big factor as you navigate and the way you think about this business, this business model and GenAI is a category, who's going to win, who's going to lose and which customers really want the solution, how quickly do they want the solution if they see the value they want it yesterday, and that's a great sign for us. Operator : Thank you. And with that, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation today, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2024 ServiceNow Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Darren Yip, Group Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Darren Yip : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2024 results and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2023 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William McDermott : Thank you, Darren, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. By now you've all seen the press release, we crushed the quarter, we raised the full year guidance, and we've never been more excited about the future of ServiceNow. But before we get into all the details, I just want to comment on the leadership announcements we made today. The company received an internal complaint earlier this year regarding the hiring of an individual who had previously been a U.S. government employee. As you would expect, we took the complaint very seriously. The Board of Directors conducted a thorough internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel and determined that our company policy was violated. Acting with total transparency, the company proactively disclose the findings of the investigation to the proper government entities. And as a result, today, we're announcing the departure of the individual who's hiring was the subject of the original complaint. We also came to a mutual agreement that CJ Desai, our President and COO, would offer his resignation from the company effective immediately. While we believe this was an isolated incident, we are further sharpening our hiring policies and procedures as a result of the situation. And when it comes to compliance, let me be perfectly clear, we are fully committed to doing the right thing. And from a continuity standpoint, I'm extremely proud that our team has the incredible depth of talent and expertise to lead forward without any disruption. In fact, Chris Bedi, a respective ServiceNow executive for the past decade, who was recently named the MIT Sloan CIO Leadership Award winner for 2024. He'll serve as the interim Chief Product Officer, while I consider internal and external candidates alike. Our entire products and engineering team is the best in the enterprise software industry, and they're focused on delivering our Xanadu release in a few weeks' time. In fact, I just got done talking with them. They're in great shape. And we wanted to give you the facts as clearly and succinctly as possible because we have so much else to cover today. So as I said at the start, ServiceNow is once again in a beat and raise situation. Our Q2 results prove that we are delivering elite level execution. Subscription revenue grew 23% year-over-year at constant currency, which is 100 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO grew 22.5% at constant currency, which is 200 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 27%, nearly 250 basis points above our guidance and we had 88 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, up from 70% a year ago, a 26% year-over-year increase. A year ago, Q2 had one deal greater than 1 million from a net new logo perspective. This year, we had six of them that were net new logos. Our first federal customer actually crossed the 100 million plus ACV threshold, and we signed our third largest net new AC deal ever. All of our workflow businesses were in more than one-half of our top 20 deals. Security and Risk, ITSM and ITOM had eight, nine and 10 deals over 1 million, respectively. Customer workflows had a big Q2 with 14 deals over 1 million, employee workflows had 12 deals over 1 million and creator had 10 deals over 1 million. What's the headline? ServiceNow is relevance is the AI platform for business transformation is soaring. This is a growth company on an unprecedented trajectory. Moving to the topic of AI. NowAssist net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter, significantly overachieving our expectations and it became the fastest growing new product in the company's history. We signed 11 NowAssist deals with 1 million plus NACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million. We had impressive wins across industries, from banking, health care and manufacturing to semis, tech and many others. As an AI lighthouse customer, Stellantis is using ServiceNow. As its strategic AI platform to manage operations across HR, finance and supply chain. American Honda selected NowAssist as their Gen AI solution of choice to improve deflection and efficiency of service, delivering a world class experience to their employees. Merck is using the ServiceNow platform to streamline operations across IT and cybersecurity to advance its global biopharmaceutical business. Adobe will leverage NowAssist to optimize routine tasks for employees, which will increase efficiency across the entire organization. Dell will integrate NowAssist with its service capabilities to deliver a seamless customer and employee experience and with NowAssist, ST Microelectronics plans to enhance productivity and user experiences across their entire organization. LTIMindtree is using NowAssist for ITSM to increase developer productivity by 30% with code and flow generation. We're also collaborating together to grow and expand offerings in finance and supply chain workflows. So why are so many enterprises rapidly adopting ServiceNow's Gen AI strategy? Think about this in the context of design thinking and innovation. The first pillar is always desirability. Do we have the big idea? ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our Gen AI strategy is focused on infusing intelligence into the flow of work, end-to-end across the enterprise, every department, every persona. With our native integrations, we already help people orchestrate across different systems and data sources. Now we can train the machines to do the low value work so the people can up level to the knowledge work. The second pillar is viability, does our approach to Gen AI make business sense? We set the tone on innovating with domain specific multimodal language models. This approach is more accurate. It doesn't have the hallucinations of the large models from the Internet. It's faster to train, and it's faster to deploy these models. It's more cost effective and sustainable because these models are less GPU hungry than public models. The final pillar is feasibility. Can we actually do it? This is the best pillar of all for ServiceNow because we've actually done it. When you look at our own deployment of NowAssist, the initial results are staggering. With better deflection, our IT help desk is saving 45 minutes per avoided case and customer service. Our colleagues are saving 30 minutes every time the computer generates the knowledge based article for them. Our employees will save 21,000 hours with faster self-service and our developers are completing non-complex scripts and half the time. This is a moment where business leaders are looking for the role model. What does it look like to run a business with Gen AI at the core? ServiceNow. Thanks to our engineering and our Now on Now teams is leading the way. This is an excitement for Gen AI. And it's one recent Gartner forecast global IT spending will be up 8.9% in 2024 and that's even higher than originally forecasted. By the way, more than 3 times GDP. Within software spend according to IDC, Software-as-a-Service will grow 17%. So the trend line is clear. Enterprise software buyers are moving away from consolidating the past into building for the AI future. ServiceNow has been the modernizer at many points on this journey, creating a single pane of glass into the IT estate. Expanding our core from IT to employee service to customer service, now making it easy to build new consumer grade applications on a single data model. The AI moment is the culmination of this journey. CIOs don't want 1,000 points of dim light. They're betting on a few market leading platforms working together as the great unlock. They see ServiceNow as the intelligent action platform spanning the entire enterprise. And that is why our pipeline has built from knowledge over 50% year-over-year improvement. It's why CIO surveys continue to show ServiceNow's relevance rising to the top of the charts. It's why more IT and line of business buyers alike are looking at long-term blueprints for ServiceNow and planning out the future with us. It's why Jensen Wang hit it on the head when he said, ServiceNow is the AI operating system for the enterprise. Customers are seeing us like Jensen sees us. While our performance has been consistently strong, we take nothing for granted. Every aspect of our innovation engine and our go-to-market machine is moving up to the next level. We're tracking and tackling more of the automation and market opportunities every day with both our customers and our engineers. Our new Creator Studio available with ServiceNow App Engine is extending our existing low code leadership to no code. So every employee can now build applications. Other updates to our automation engine help simplify RPA deployments. We see a great opportunity for ServiceNow there. We're moving even faster on co-innovation partnerships with major global brands, an expanded multiyear agreement will extend ServiceNow capabilities to all BT Group units. Bell Canada will develop new capabilities within the business service experience while accelerating their own internal transformation as a tech services and digital media leader. This is the largest telecommunications collaboration for ServiceNow and the first of its kind in Canada. Boomi is expanding from a small ServiceNow footprint to replace existing competitor implementations. Boomi will use all NowAssist solutions and work with us on joint product development. Deloitte is leveraging the ServiceNow platform to drive industry specific managed services to bring AI based innovations to clients around the world. We are accelerating our growth in key geographic markets and verticals. ServiceNow will help the U.S. Air Force adopt new best-in-class technology. The federal government's National Science Foundation is utilizing ServiceNow's new Gen AI solutions to support their mission to promote research, expanding knowledge and science, engineering and education. In Germany, Bayer is using NowAssist to empower their employees with Gen AI and hyper automation as they create a culture, where every employee has the potential to innovate. Our momentum in Japan continues with major wins this quarter, including Nomura, Panasonic Information Systems and Nitori Holdings. We announced plans to launch a ServiceNow UAE cloud hosted on Microsoft Azure, so we can meet the business transformation requirements of all public and private sector entities in the UAE. We announced two growth investments in our partner ecosystem in India. In Morpheus, we'll extend our presence in India and across Southeast Asia through the development of new Gen AI offerings, solutions and digital skills training. Prodapt will further develop digital business transformation through AI enabled solutions and the Now Platform skills expansion. We're also expanding into new categories, further increasing ServiceNow's total addressable market yet again. Industry analysts have reported that the number one priority for CIOs is getting their data house in order. And that's why at knowledge, we shared our plans for a powerful new database offering. RaptorDB, it's built for enterprises looking for speed and scale to support new AI use cases. RaptorDB give ServiceNow customers the capability to ingest data at massive scale from multiple data sources, so they can analyze it much faster to feed our domain specific models. We're already achieving 12x transactional throughput and 27x improvement in response time for analytic inquiries in our ProPlus version of the platform. Today, we're launching the RaptorDB lighthouse program. This is similar to our highly successful Gen AI lighthouse program. This new offering is designed for a select group of top customers at the forefront of this new AI world. We already have many signing up. We also completed a tuck-in acquisition of Raizen, an industry leading data company based in Germany, in combination with NowAssist. Raizen will further accelerate our Gen AI-powered search and knowledge management capabilities. This is only the beginning. The data opportunity is massive, and we intend to make some additional announcements on September 10, regarding our growing data ambition. As you can see, ServiceNow is not opportunity constrained. New buying centers, new industries, new geographic markets and we're fielding more inbound interest for new partnerships that at any point in our history. There's a sense of excitement here in the community, in our company, and it's all for good reason. In closing, our focus is exactly where it should be. Expanding this differentiated platform, scaling this business, and delivering great results for our stakeholders. I've got a few questions about the second half, with a rare speculation out there that elections or other macro factors will challenge the business environment. Are our customers mindful of the unknowns and the broader macro, of course, that's exactly why they are leaning in to ServiceNow. Because AI is the elixir that drives productivity, cost efficiency and new business models. Simply put, Enterprises are investing in business transformation. They are investing in AI. They are building a new reference architecture for the decades to come. This is the largest, most compelling business opportunity in the world. We are bullish on what's ahead. That's why we have not only confirmed, but also raised our full year guidance. Our brand represents an optimistic view of the world's future. It's why we're putting AI to work for people. And ultimately, why? As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Fred Luddy's original dream, we believe the next 20 years will be even more exciting. I personally have never been more convinced that ServiceNow will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your questions. I'll now turn you over to Gina. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another fantastic quarter with tremendous beats across all of our top line and profitability metrics. ServiceNow's business remains resilient with net new ACV and Gen AI contributions exceeding expectations. Once again, the team demonstrated exceptional execution as we continue to see strong demand for the Now Platform and our NowAssist offerings. Q2 subscription revenues were $2.542 billion, growing 23% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $18.6 billion, representing 31.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. We continue to see average contract terms increase with TCV from five plus year deals more than tripling year-over-year. Current RPO was $8.78 billion, representing 22.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 200 basis point beat versus our guidance, and a 150 basis point acceleration from Q1. From an industry perspective, U.S. Federal had a great quarter, accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year with net new ACV up well over 50% from last Q2. Manufacturing and Energy and utilities were also areas of strength, growing net new ACV over 50% year-over-year. Healthcare & Life Sciences and Retail and Hospitality, both had a great quarter, growing about 30% year-over-year. The Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers' operations, reflected by a strong 98% renewal rate. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to continue to build upon. We closed 88 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, representing 26% growth year-over-year. This includes six new logos, two of which were G2K customers. We continue to see robust large deal momentum in the quarter closing 14 deals over 5 million in net new ACV and four deals over 10 million. Our focus on selling a comprehensive platform continue to drive more multiproduct deals, as 14 of our top 20 deals included eight or more products. We now have 1,988 customers paying us over 1 million in ACV. In addition, the number of customers paying us 20 million or more grew nearly 40% year-over-year. As Bill highlighted, our Gen AI net new ACV to date continues to trend ahead of any new product family launched for the comparable period. Our Plus SKU saw more than a 30% price uplift over Pro in Q2. Furthermore since launch, we're seeing a greater than 3x increase in average deal size versus the comparable Pro upgrade. NowAssist cogeneration capabilities within creative workflows remain a powerful productivity tool of choice as well, appearing in over 70% of our Gen AI deals. Best of all, customers are going live fast. We're learning with them, releasing innovations based on that feedback at a very fast clip to get them to value. In July, BT Group announced that its NowAssist pilot help agents write case summaries and review complex nodes faster, cutting both times by 55%. This helped drive down the average time to resolve cases by a third. We are just scratching the surface of the opportunity as the vast majority of Gen AI sales are direct. We're working to onboard partners, arming them with the tools to sell NowAssist and further extend our go-to-market reach. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 27%, approximately 250 basis points above our guidance, driven by OpEx efficiencies, top line outperformance and timing of marketing spend. Our free cash flow margin was 14%. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $8.9 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. Given our Q2 outperformance, we are raising our 2024 outlook. For 2024, we are raising our subscription revenues by $33 million at the midpoint of the range to more than offset an incremental $20 million FX headwinds. This raise yields a net increase of $13 million on a narrowed range of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion representing 22% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 29% to 29.5%. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, free cash flow margin of 31%, and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $2.660 billion and $2.665 billion, representing 20% to 20.5% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect CRPO growth of 22.5% on a reported basis or 22% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29.5%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter, and we continue to see strength heading into the second half of the year. Our knowledge embed in May was an incredible three days of inspiring keynotes, amazing demos, intriguing breakout sessions and plenty of discussions around AI as it was woven into every aspect of the event. ServiceNow's focus on putting AI to work for people was a consistent theme for the over 20,000 participants, including 5 billion of pipeline in the room. The response from customers around our latest innovation has been incredible. As Bill mentioned, newly created pipeline after only 60 days was up 50% year-over-year and that has since growth over $1 billion. Our second half pipelines combined with our net new ACV outperformance in the first half of '24 gives us very good visibility into our top line guide and further confidence in our journey to $15 billion plus in revenue. We are well on our way to becoming a defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter, and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this incredible team. With that, I'll open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. In an environment that, as you guys noted, a lot of people are concerned about -- Bill, can you talk to us a little bit more about what is it that enables you guys to get these contracts closed, if you will? What we're hearing from a lot of CIOs is, excitement about the opportunity but tentativeness in pulling the trigger, but you guys seem to be able to get people to pull the trigger. What is it that enables you to pull the trigger? And then, a follow-up for Gina. Was there any unusual activity in terms of like, deals slipping from Q1 to Q2 or was this just fundamentally the strength of Q2? William McDermott : Thank you very much for the question, Keith. I would, first of all, begin by discussing this incredible platform and the difference that it makes. If you take all the complexity that's out there, and you think about what CEOs today want, they're looking for new vectors of growth to have to radically simplify their companies and digitization is really the only way out. But the difficult thing is most people are selling into a department where they have a narrow threaded solution and that doesn't necessarily change the way work flows and the way business processes get executed. So we're able, -- especially with our Gen AI built into this incredible platform, we're able to demonstrate real value, and that ROI is undeniable and we have a culture built to deliver value. We have a team in who knows how to describe value. And obviously, we're very market connected. I do give the culture here credit for what I call an elite level of execution. So that's just built into the fabric of our DNA, great innovation, great execution, great integration between what we build, how we take it to market, and how in the post-sale world, we care for that value to be ultimately delivered quickly and provable ROI. Gina Mastantuono : And then, Keith, on your question about any unusual activity of deals slipping from Q1 to Q2? No. Actually, we just saw pretty incredible great execution across the board in Q2. From a revenue perspective, net new ACV outperformance that we talked about strong execution of the ServiceNow incredible go-to-market team, as you would expect. On-prem did come in a little bit ahead of expectations, but the net new ACV outperformance was more -- was much more impactful. With respect to the CRPO beat, also, again, primarily driven by net new ACV outperformance, a little bit higher or early renewals. As you know, I\u2019ve been pretty prudent in how I\u2019ve been guiding for early renewals and continue to do so. But the beat was really a function of incredible execution by this team once again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Bill, you talked about some of the used cases like BT, where you kind of -- with your slightly smaller, more efficient fast language models are achieving very good results. And is that like a blueprint of the way we think -- we should think about AI going forward in terms of like [indiscernible] very large models that you -- as a small and more nimblest play, actually can do achieve a lot more because you're more specialized. Thank you and congrats. William McDermott : Yeah. Raimo, thank you very much for the question. And I think the key to our domain specific or smaller models, as you mentioned it, they're lightning quick. There's no latency because we're working with the customers' data. They are highly secure again because it's the customer's data, and they're inexpensive to run. And when companies see the bandwidth of a platform that goes end-to-end. So everywhere from the entire IT estate for digital transformation, or recreating an employee experience where employees actually get excited to come to work and do their job, because we take the busy work out of their life or the customer experience can be totally reimagined and then inspiring developers to do what they do best, which is dream about net new innovation and building new business models. You see this, obviously, you mentioned BT, I could have easily said London Stock Exchange, where they deployed us for a core business transformation, and they unified 15 siloed platforms and 14 lines of business on the ServiceNow platform. And they actually saw a deflection rates increase to 85% of the cases, and 35% time improved and summarizing incidents. And by the way, NowAssist does this in seconds. So we're talking about two days per employee improvement and productivity. I could have gone to TriMedx. A biotech company and basically, what they're doing NowAssist is they're enhancing developer productivity, which has increased for them 22%, and they saw 50% of their developers actively using NowAssist in just three months. I could have also mentioned Kainos, a digital technology solutions provider. They created 600 knowledge articles with NowAssist and they were able to improve access to their knowledge content for their customers and employees. Their satisfaction from a customer standpoint went from 80 to 99 and this is just amazing stuff. We just went general availability with our Gen AI SKUs for our government Community Cloud. This is June 28, by the way. One customer had a go live in implementation schedule for Q3, but their pilot went so well that they decided, they needed it immediately activated in Q2. So you\u2019re into a whole different program here with rapid time to value a product that people love to use and the executives get excited because their people are so happy. Their customers are so happy. Their innovators are so happy. And we\u2019re so market connected that we know what\u2019s going on in every one of these instances, they know we\u2019re not mailing it in from a deck. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Just amazing. Thank you. William McDermott : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Raimo. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Bill, you'd be the last person to mail it from the desk. That's for sure. Congratulations to the team from amazing results and Gina, I couldn't help but notice that RPO growth overall hit 30% plus for the first time in eight years, so certainly kudos on that front. Bill, one for you. You've been through multiple macro cycles, if there is a rate reduction and there's a regime change for more Pro-business, if you want to call it that way and count the '25. Have there been certain things that have been holding back so much to the extent that you guys have done really, really well. What could be the bigger macro unlocks as we head towards more rate cuts ahead? And also on the AI front, it\u2019s remarkable how much productivity improvement you've been able to give your clients with just three quarters of shipping the product. Where do you see NowAssist go forward? I mean, is it going to follow the path created by employ workflows, customer service workflows, greater workflows. I mean are we going to go deeper into each of these domains and unveil more and more AI unlocks there? Thank you so much and congratulations. William McDermott : Thank you very much, Kash. I really appreciate your thoughtful comments and your question. I think the bottom line is consolidating the past is really not moving the ball forward and innovating the future is. I think we have a dream for the company. I think we know how to describe that dream to the C-suite. I think we're now toggling across the entire C-suite, where we've expanded the perimeter in the relationship plan and the solution road map. And obviously, internally, we've scaled the company where it's ready to make a bold move now and be the defining one in the enterprise. So I think all that's coming together once for us. In terms of the broader macro, you saw the investment in hardware, obviously, for the AI world. You saw the incredible success of the great NVIDIA company and the work that they're doing. You see great companies like Microsoft doing incredibly well with Office and dynamics and teams and copilot, so they're standard. And then you see the hyperscalers all doing well, whether it's Azure, it's AWS or its GCP, they're all doing well. And good news is we integrate with all of them. So we know the hyperscaler trend, okay? We built our Gen AI strategy with NVIDIA. We knew they were going to be the winner. We had no doubt about that. And we knew that the world of the 20th century would eventually get the picture that you can't upgrade the past and expect it to give you a different result. And any time we get a chance to tell that story and prove it with a great demo and great success cases, we blow people away with innovation. But to answer your question in terms of where are we headed? Where we're headed is we're going to transform entire industries. And if I give you an example of that, take the utility industry, for example, they have to maximize the power grid uptime. They're trying to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities of critical assets, and I need to do everything in real time, whether it's repairing things, taking care of equipment, skills, parts, field service technicians, equipment suppliers. There's a whole distributed value chain. We're going to reinvent the whole industry, and we've got to put it on the ServiceNow platform. And we've got to take the data, and we're going to connect all the disparate parts that are suffocating companies, and we're going to move it into the Now Platform, and we're going to reimagine the way work flows. And I could say that for manufacturing, think about predictive maintenance across multiple sites, combining IoT data with advanced analytics to optimize profitability, improve operational efficiency, think about consumer goods. They want AI-powered chatbots to deliver personalized shopping experiences. And just think about your own shopping experience. You could buy a great product, but if you can't return it in a streamlined way. You drop the brand. You're not doing business with them anymore. So it's a virtuous cycle to think about the quality of the product, the service experience of the customer and ultimately advocating for the customer and giving them what they want, that's all workflow, and we're going to automate that entire industry. And so rethink health care, rethink manufacturing, rethink utilities, you rethink consumer goods. We're going for it all. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Weed of Bernstein. Your line is open. Peter Weed : Thank you and congratulations on the continued momentum. I think the big surprising news of the day was, obviously, some of the changes in leadership. CJ obviously is a really important part of the senior leadership team one of the people that I often pointed out to clients about the success and leadership there. Beyond naming Chris as the Chief Product Officer, what do you see the key operational steps to ensure a smooth transition? And what additional actions are you taking to kind of ensure continuity and one of those keys to success. And I guess it's probably not just operationally with the team, but also probably with the public sector business, given that was a bit of where this work came from. William McDermott : Thank you very much, Peter. I appreciate your question. We have an unbelievable team. And actually, we've already been in execution mode on where we're taking the company and the leadership team. I met with all of them today, including Pat Casey, who is one of the co-founders of the company, and he actually runs the cloud for the company. and all of the line of business development leaders. Chris Bedi is in there on an acting capacity because he knows my decision making style and he can integrate beautifully with the great engineers that we have and the great grow to market people we have, so we don\u2019t drop a single step in our March to be the defining one. So everybody is fired up. They understand the mission, and they\u2019re ready to go. And I will hire a Chief Product Officer. It could come from the inside of the company or the outside of the company on a more permanent basis. But we\u2019re not going to miss a step in execution. We\u2019re already on the move. So very, very, very confident in our company. And by the way, they\u2019re very, very confident that our business is in great shape. And I do want to mention the U.S. public sector remains a substantially important industry vertical to our company, and we continue to believe that, that is poised for further growth, especially in third quarter because that\u2019s when a lot of the decisions get made. And we have our arms around that. Our great public service companies love us. We love them. We\u2019re doing a great job for them, and we don\u2019t intend to miss a beat here, Peter. Peter Weed : Thank you. William McDermott : Thank you very much. Operator, do we lose you there? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just an exceptional quarter, guys. Thanks for making our evening easier. So maybe, Bill, first question for you. Just as I think through AI, clearly, you're one of the few companies that's seeing significant demand upfront and strong early traction. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, for the companies that you're talking to about AI that have attached it, what do you think is causing them to hold out? And what do you think is the trigger that makes them join the party? William McDermott : Yeah. In terms of the companies that are buying AI products in the companies that aren't? Samad Samana : Correct. For the ones that haven't adopted it yet, that you're still having that conversation with how do you get them to join the party? William McDermott : Yeah. It's a really important question, Samad, because I think what's happened is they've heard so many whitewashed AI stories from pretenders that they are a little jaded. So we have to get in there and show them all the use cases, show them the demos, show them the customer success stories, give them the handful of references that are already doing it. And before you know it, were off to the races. And then we show them our road map for where we're taking the company and they realize they don't want second-mover advantage, because if other participants in their industry move out and they don't, they could lose. And also, if you think about employees, soon, employees won't tolerate the nonsenses going on with 800 numbers, busy work, silly work that doesn't make a difference and they'll go work somewhere else. So the same thing is true with customers. So I think that it's an education. It's a demonstration. And it's having the validity of success where you have permission to go into the C-suite and they're interested in listening to your story. Once they hear our story and once they see us in action, it's an order. And then it's a quick install and then it's a go-live and then it's amazing productivity. That's what's happening. Gina Mastantuono : And Samad, I would just add, and I talked about this in my script that we're just scratching the surface of that opportunity and the vast majority of our current sales are direct, right? So we're working now really strongly with our partners and the ecosystem to arm them with the tools to sell, and that's going to extend our go-to-market reach even broader. Those partners are so critical and so important and they are leaning in very heavily with us. And so that's going to be another part of kind of the continued acceleration here. William McDermott : I think Gina makes a great point there, and I did hear one analyst one say, yes, I've been talking to the partner checks and the channel and I'm not hearing a lot from the partners. Yes, that's because, as Gina said, they're still getting activated. But can you imagine when they do, if you see these results when we're doing it on our own and then you get thousands and thousands and thousands of more feet on the street telling the same story, it's a wow factor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your line is open. Karl Keirstead : Well, thanks. Maybe I'll direct this one to Gina. Gina, three months ago, you had signaled an expected pretty solid sequential acceleration in CRPO in 3Q. I know things change. So I'm just wondering if you might revisit that second half outlook. And specifically, given the second half election uncertainty that Bill flagged I'm wondering if you're being a shade more conservative on the 3Q CRPO guide, given how big 3Q is in the public sector. Gina Mastantuono : Yes, Karl. It\u2019s a great question. I think that as expected, and I talked a little bit earlier that part of the beat, most of the beat for Q2 was all about execution and net new ACV, but there was part of the beat that was early renewals. I\u2019m continuing to be prudent in how I\u2019m factoring in early renewals because they are so customer-by-customer specific. And so what I would say is that I continue to be prudent in how we think about guide for Q3 and the full year. But I remain extremely confident in that pipeline that I talked about. So pipeline coverage ratios are strong maturity is better than same time last year. We came out of knowledge with 50% more pipe generated in the first 60 days. And that number, I spoke earlier, has surpassed $1 billion. And so pipe remains strong. Opportunity, as you\u2019ve heard Bill and I talk about so far today is fantastic. Demand seems healthy, but you\u2019re right, there\u2019s definitely a little bit of uncertainty in the back half of the year, and we continue to be prudent in some of our assumptions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around that on that same note there on pipeline. With 50% increase since knowledge, sounds impressive, sounds exciting. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength, maybe a glimpse into what that pipeline looks like across the stack. Are there any standouts whether it's in IT or customer employee creator? Obviously, NowAssist I'm sure, has a large part to do with that as well. So I just would love to get a little color there. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah, Brad. I would say, it\u2019s very much across the board. Similar to the results that you saw in Q3, it\u2019s really strength across the platform. Whether it\u2019s IT, customer employee creator as well as NowAssist. And so what I would say is, we\u2019re operating on all cylinders here and pipeline being generated is really very across the board. But as you would imagine, with respect to Gen AI, there is such excitement and such attention there that we absolutely see very strong pipeline as we think about Gen AI in the back half and then moving into \u201825 and beyond. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much And I'll echo the congrats on a really nice quarter. Bill, you alluded to this a little bit earlier in one of your answers, but I was just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the opportunity around operational technology for you all. Where are you in terms of starting to have those conversations with customers? And can you just expand a little bit on your thoughts and hopes for that product set as we look out over the next six, 12 months? Thanks. William McDermott : Yeah. Thank you very much, Kirk, for the question. I really do appreciate it. It\u2019s really amazing. The initial demand for this product and this offering, as you saw from the Washington, D.C. release and what you saw at knowledge \u201824 has really surprised us on the upside how quickly it\u2019s taken off. In Q2, as an example, we had a large biopharmaceutical company, Golfer OT. They mix it with IT. We had a huge biotech and pharma company and a large Japanese auto company. And what we\u2019re already seeing is partners like Boomi, STMicro and a multinational electronics company also based in Japan go for it. So we think that there\u2019s a big opportunity here for both of these products. OT has increased our technology workflow TAM by about $5 billion. In addition, we see sales and order management. This is helping us address the $68 billion customer workflow TAM. So it\u2019s still early days, but we are super encouraged by the traction that we see so far and we\u2019ll continue to monitor and update you guys on this, but it\u2019s a meaningful part of our portfolio now. And again, one of the beauties of this company is the beauty of linking the engineering development effort with the feet on the street and having that high-touch intimacy with the customer and the virtuous cycle back into development where the customer feels that they are the developers developing their dreams and our great engineers are capable of doing things so quickly here. And this is yet another example. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just the first one. This was like I think by far the strongest RPO quarter that you had in, I think, three years since 2021, and I guess the question is if I look at -- if I think about the inverse of Keith's questions around deals that pushed from Q1 to Q2, are there any deals that you feel like got done earlier than you otherwise would have thought that you may be pulled in any deals because the confidence, Gina, that you're referring to in the pipeline, help us just give us a sense for that? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah. So you're absolutely right. RPO growing at 31% year-over-year is pretty incredible, especially at our scale. We continue to see average contract terms increase right? And so Q2 had the largest quarterly average contract term for Q2 since 2018. And so we're seeing TCV from five plus year deals more than tripling. I said that in my script. And so we're really seeing a meaningful uptick in multiyear duration contracts as customers are really seeing the power of the Now platform and just making longer, more strategic deals, which is resulting in that. And so no big differences in kind of any pull forwards of deals, a slight uptick in early renewals, as I talked about, but that was only against a prudent guide. So again, it's really about the power of the platform customers really understanding how we're using Gen AI into that platform and really becoming the AI platform for business transformation. That's it. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And maybe just linearity in the quarter, any commentary there? And maybe also if AI conversations are already driving just much larger, more strategic engagements that are leading to some of this RPO growth. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. So linearity in Q2 was good. I feel really good about what we saw. And absolutely, AI is AI conversations are driving very strategic engagements and obviously, driving larger average contract terms, right? Again, it's customers really leaning into a longer strategic partnership and getting it now. And so I think all of that is a big part of what you're seeing in our results. William McDermott : And Alex, I would build on what Gina stand by just thinking about the time line that you mentioned, we became a platform company, that's what happened. We've gone from a product company with a land and expand mentality to an AI platform for business transformation that's looking at industry that we're looking at the complete bandwidth of what a company is trying to pull off. And then to give you a piece of the brand, I think we differentiated ourselves by putting AI to work for people. And people include people like us. It includes employees. It includes customers. It includes people that build the software and includes people to keep the place secure. So all these things were taken into account in the strategic direction of how we would build a strategic platform company. And when Gina tells you, the deal sizes are expanding. The duration of the agreements are expanding. It\u2019s consistent with the company that is scaling, right, before your eyes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much, amazing quarter. Bill, I'm wondering what did you experience? And what type of opportunity do you see perhaps in response to the crowd strike issues and outages. Is it reasonable to think that you could have some large companies that would want more telemetry across the IP estate more ability to monitor and detect outages and improve incident response. It would seem like that could play a directly into your ITOM and SecOps capabilities. And then, Gina, I saw the sales and marketing headcount growth picked up. And I was wondering if you just reached a point where something is signaling to you to move into a more aggressive kind of a hiring posture? William McDermott : Okay. Well, I'll start off and then Gina can talk about our hiring strategy, and thank you for your kind remarks, Mark. There was 0 impact on customer systems from CrowdStrike outage on July '18 as it relates to ServiceNow. There was zero impact to data integrity financial systems and the integrity of the operations of the companies as it relates to ServiceNow. And thanks to our CMDB, I think you're onto a very good marketing and sales idea and the service mapping of the CMDB we had instant visibility into which systems, which business services and infrastructure were impacted in our customers' environment. And our automated workflows sped up the remediation and the employees were kept up to date via our ServiceNow portal. So I think this could actually lead to more sales opportunities once non-ServiceNow customers see what's possible with a platform like this. Gina Mastantuono : And on your question on sales and marketing, I highlighted that it would be picking up even in Q1, right? So Q1 was a little bit lower because last year, Q1 was a big hiring quarter. But yes, we absolutely are focused on ensuring that we're hiring feet on the street, quota bearing sales to go and drive these opportunities that we keep talking about. So we do expect hiring and sales and marketing to kind of continue to tick up a bit that very much in line with our original plans. And obviously, the more we over exceed and the opportunity grows, we will continue to hire to ensure that we have those feet on the street driving and closing those deals. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist Securities. Your line is open. Joel Fishbein : Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the fantastic quarter. Bill, for you, you acknowledge you announced a further strategic partnership with Microsoft now assisting copilot integration. Just love to hear from you how that's actually proceeding and if you're driving deals together for those solutions. Thanks. A \u2013 William McDermott : Thank you very much, Joel. We have a really fantastic partnership with Microsoft. And I think that has actually opened additional addressable market for ServiceNow. And there is a co-sell motion with Microsoft\u2019s enterprise sales team. We do work together very closely with them. And we\u2019re a good teammates, and we\u2019re good partners. And we know that both of us working together is what the customer wants. That\u2019s why we do it. And ServiceNow is really helping customers streamline their migrations to Azure. And while Azure exposes us to a much wider spectrum of customers, I think we also help the relevance of Azure because we\u2019re getting big. And we\u2019re expanding in multiple industries and geographies. And we\u2019re really thinking strategically about how we can win net new logos together, and we\u2019ve had some examples of them. We closed seven $1 million-plus now on Azure deals in Q2, with two of them as new logo wins, and one deal, in fact, was over $30 million in net new ACV. So we\u2019re quite confident that the partnership and synergy will enable us to bring value to more customers and we\u2019ll do it at unprecedented speed and scale. And I have been very straight up with everybody. I don\u2019t go any place without acknowledging Microsoft as a standard. And I recognize the copilot does very important things, and it gets even more interesting when all the capability of NowAssist and the things that we built our platform to do is complementary and fully integrated into Microsoft. And that\u2019s really the winning formula, and it has been from day one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Robbie Owens : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Bill, somewhat curious just where customer conversations are around data governance as we think about these modern architectures as you're thinking about RaptorDB, is that an area that we should expect ServiceNow to play in directly or play in via partnership? Thanks. William McDermott : Thank you very much for the question, Rob. I would say at this point, I want you to think about workflow automation, Gen AI on our platform and our ability to take RaptorDB and gather any data source, regardless of who\u2019s governing it or where it is and activating that in to automate the way things get done. And as an example, this lighthouse program that we have has a group right now of design partners and early adapters of RaptorDB. And I think it will further accelerate our pro version of the ServiceNow platform in addition to entering us into a whole new TAM to complement the Now platform, Pro+, NowAssist and then the RaptorDB-Pro. And we\u2019re going to use the learnings from this program to further develop our offering. And we do see our role as integrating as opposed to competing with other data providers because the customer wants to activate our platform to do good work with all of the data estates that they have because we have the only AI platform for business transformation in the enterprise. And if we can go everywhere, it just extends our reach and the bandwidth of our TAM and the executional excellence that we can bring to stakeholders. So it\u2019s all part of our thinking big and activating all this in industry-specific use cases. So when we show up, we\u2019re not funding through a brochure, we got a demo in our hands, and we\u2019re showing you how you can transform a business process. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much and congrats on the elite level execution and the great results. Gina, I just got a couple of quick ones for you. You had a big step-up in CapEx this quarter. Can you comment on what drove that and the cadence we should expect going forward? And then also just a point of clarification. Is there any federal business you foresee having to unwind as a result of the investigation you conducted? And should we assume that, that would all be factored into guidance? Thanks. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah. So I\u2019ll take that second question first. So no, there\u2019s no federal business that we foresee we will need to unwind full stop. And then with respect to the step-up in CapEx, it\u2019s more quarterly timing than anything else. Expectations for full year has not changed. And as you would imagine, focus of our CapEx is on AI and Gen AI. But as we talked about at Financial Analyst Day, it\u2019s already baked into any guidance that I would have given you. So I wouldn\u2019t take into account an any quarterly kind of timing-related stuff. Brad Zelnick : Awesome. Very helpful and congrats again. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Brad. William McDermott : Thank you, Brad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham & Company. Your line is open. Michael Cikos : Great. Thanks for getting me on, guys. I just had a couple of quick questions. The first I think that you guys had expected, call it, about 200 basis points of headwind to 2Q CRPO in relation to the public sector. Did that play out as expected? And then can you remind us \u2013 off the top of my head, I want to say that normalizes as we lap those contracts in Q3. But does that federal headwind go away now. Gina Mastantuono : So yes, that headwind to Q2 CRPO did play out as expected. And yes, it will normalize in Q3. But remember, depending on the size of our Fed business in Q3, it could pop up again as we play out Q4 and beyond. Obviously, we\u2019ll let you know as that comes to fruition or not. But yes, it should normalize now in Q3 as expected. Michael Cikos : Understood. Thank you very much and congrats on a strong quarter. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks so much, Mike. Operator : We have time for one last question. Your last question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Hedberg : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a quick one for Gina. Kind of following up on the last few questions. Subscription revenue has been decelerating here, but CRPO has been accelerating and obviously, even put the guide. Is that just a function, Gina, of the renewals that we\u2019re seeing, whether it\u2019s Q2 or Q3? Just maybe a little bit of the divergence between subscription revenue and CRPO growth. Gina Mastantuono : Yeah. So basically, what that really is showing you is that net new ACV has reaccelerated in first half \u201824 versus first half \u201823. The other piece has nothing to do with early renewals really. The other piece is that are expected on-prem mix in Q3 of this year is lower than \u2013 is a little bit lower than last year. So all good things as you think about the results for Q2 and what it means going forward. Matt Hedberg : Great. Congrats on the quarter guys. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Matt. William McDermott : Thank you very much, Matt. Operator : We thank you for your participation in today's call. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William McDermott : Thank you very much, Darren. Good afternoon everyone. I really appreciate you joining today. There's a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report. I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow's growth trajectory. The first is elite level execution. With our Q3 results, we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution. We outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. cRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31%, more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. We landed our second largest new logo deal ever and our second customer crossed the $100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow's platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams, ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals with double-digit deals over $1 million. It's also worth noting that IT asset management was in all of our top 20 deals. Q3 was another strong performance for Security and Risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over $1 million. As we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over $1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over $1 million and creative workflow was strong again in 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over $1 million. Here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment. ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the Rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution. The second tailwind behind ServiceNow's success is our growing strategic relevance. For years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems. Organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess, so they can modernize for the AI world, ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platforms. And we integrate with all those other systems, orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer-grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here. When public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control, the cost, security and integration. And ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI. We do see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower, which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver. ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With Now Assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six over $5 million and two over $10 million, and this continues to be our fastest-growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross-enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest gen AI release to date, Xanadu. This included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged Now Assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft CoPilot integration and more. Xanadu expanded industry vertical AI-powered automation for telco, tech, public sector, banking, insurance and manufacturing. We released Now Assist with security, procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers. Xanadu showcased ServiceNow's leadership with Agentic AI. And until now, generative AI and the enterprise require human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow single architecture platform and cross enterprise data, ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond pro-based activity to deep contextual comprehension. This is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy. This is why IDC also forecast businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once-in-a-generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result. The fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a prescient identity for our brand. The Defense Logistics Agency works with ServiceNow Assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project, Banco do Brasil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation. The Veteran Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission-critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI-powered solutions to improve its colleague experience. After rolling out Now Assist globally, EY works ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks, to deliver faster resolutions or enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life-saving mission. Mercedes Benz works with ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cybersecurity driving the integration of Gen AI into shop floor operations. Bill Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC Technologies, a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace. We announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our Gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI. Together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out-of-the-box use cases for AI agents on the Now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints. Customers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise for small single issue resolutions, all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard acknowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB, our new ultrafast database built for AI-first enterprises, which processes transactions 12 times faster, analytics 27 times faster. Customers, including Amadeus, are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB, to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems. Our data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric, which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we can do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real-time secure access to data from source. Workflow Data Fabric also includes zero copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake so customers can turn data into instant AI-powered action, all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services company is Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market. These innovations open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow, nearly doubling our TAM to $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street's to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business. This is why we created ServiceNow University, encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences. ServiceNow University represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands. Even more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors. We also rank our list for best places to work in technology in Europe, in Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind. The best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery, will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO. Amit joins from Alphabet, where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud Platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $4 billion. Before joining Google Cloud, Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle, where he presided over their growth and Platform as a Service and data analytics. With Sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world-class engineer and engineering leader. From commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Bedi, our Chief Customer Officer, who did a great job in filling it in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that we, as a company, also did a great job. In closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning. ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our world forum events are oversubscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year-over-year. By definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge for security. By virtue of our team, our technology and strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go. That not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond. I couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth year anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow with substantial outperformance across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and Gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites, the Now Platform and Now Assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions driving incredible business in every corner of the enterprise. Q3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion, growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion, representing 33% year-over-year constant currency growth, accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Current RPO was $9.36 billion, representing 23.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Retail and Hospitality also had a fantastic quarter, growing over 80% year-over-year. Health care and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date, U.S. Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution, further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and two over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers. The importance of the Now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more, the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year-over-year, powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including six with new logos. Among them, 15 deals were over $5 million and six deals were over $10 million. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform, and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products. Our GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in Now Assist, including six over $5 million and two over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our Plus SKUs continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over Pro in Q3. With more proof points from real-world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence in Now Assist's ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and HRSD Enterprise Plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work. Another large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self-service by 30% while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI deals were sold direct, so we're starting to see our partner enablement for its results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners, we closed an HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency. In fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter, tripling net new ACV year-over-year led by Financial Services and TMC, which both quadrupled. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 31%, more than 150 basis points above our guidance, driven by the timing of spend, our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our free cash flow margin was 17%, up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.655 billion to $10.66 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, operating margin of 29.5%, free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both the reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the, Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser-focused on delivering a complete end-to-end platform experience. With the Xanadu release marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations yet, we're empowering enterprises to quickly, seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence and we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks. I'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first and then a quick follow-up on product. Bill, I mean - or Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical, from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year. But maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months, given all the tailwinds that you're seeing? Just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not? William McDermott : Well, Alex, thank you very much for the question. I think the overall macro is not dissimilar. It's still a value-based market out there, but it's been a value-based market for some time. And so the question then becomes who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer. And obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter and companies, especially at the C-suite, are building their future plans with real partnerships. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win. And we work for the customer. And the customer feels that and I think culture is something that gets underreported in earnings calls and ours is on fire. Alex Zukin : Well, by our calculations just under $90 million and Now Assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe just a follow-up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what the incremental opportunity is within your existing customers with this new data platform product and how you expect - how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and in the P&L? William McDermott : Well, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an upsell opportunity across the entire installed base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in. And by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours. So it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world, Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating. And by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process. And this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record, and we've been doing this for some time now. So I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is to data. And so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to in independent research firms, they said, Bill, ServiceNow pulls us off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here. And I am too. Alex Zukin : Excellent. Congratulations guys. William McDermott : Thanks a lot Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful up-tick in headcount additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch-up for what had been more modest sub-20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Great question, Brad. So we've told you in the past that we were going to up-tick our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota-bearing reps. And so absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We are planning to continue to accelerate our headcount growth. But remember, we do it prudently. We do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different. And so you can expect similar levels of headcount growth in the next few quarters, as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with everything Now Assist, with the Agentic AI, with the workflow data fabric, all innovation that the team is driving. Not only is sales and marketing headcount up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace. Brad Zelnick : Thanks for that Gina. And if I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask them, Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think for some go in one year and not the other, but that's elite-level execution. You're clearly out-executing others, can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is and what you might say to skeptics concerned that we're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay-to-piper moment were you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies. Thank you so much and congrats. William McDermott : Well, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you've got to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders. And I have the best leadership team in the industry, a hard stop, and we just made that even stronger with Amit. And I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they were total class and this was done in a highly transparent wonderful way, and that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud Platform and ServiceNow. I feel like that's a necessary thing. And I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people. We actually participate in building our plans together and then we overcommunicate everything. And then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything and their professional careers, you can build a defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. Now we're not even close to hitting our peak. We're not going near it. So as you think about lapping ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the board and get more results, but all those things are in flight, and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch. And I do want to thank my partners out there. They know our word is good, and they want to be part of ServiceNow. And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise. And by being that, we integrate with everybody. We're open to all the LLMs that are out there. You can even bring your own model. And at the same time, we've integrated with all the systems of record, and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across our magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results not just on productivity, take cost out, but also on a growth level. And I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, it's constant planning, overcommunicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch. Brad Zelnick : Awesome, Bill. Thank you so much. William McDermott : Thank you very much, Brad. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our fieldwork was showing a big ramp-up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could exclude heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the Now Assist numbers that you gave, they're just so big. And I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CoreWeave, we've investing billions into the U.K. and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service providers just to be able to power all your AI agents. William McDermott : Yes. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm speaking well of our company, thank you very much. I do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipeline. I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things. And it was great. Mark, you're going to kick on this. We just did a Board meeting, and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup, which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do. And he said to him, Well, let's just assume somebody is going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that sole crush people just know that Now Assist is automatically updating your health care, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most. And you didn't have to touch a single thing. You just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company. And everybody there said, oh, man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we could fix it. And that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we are looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything, and I certainly believe we're well positioned for that. Mark Murphy : Thank you so much. William McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : I got couple of - [technical difficulty] William McDermott : Kash, can you hear me? Kash Rangan : Oh, can you hear me okay? William McDermott : Oh there you are. We missed you, but now we can hear you. Kash Rangan : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly, the one - congrats on Bill, first of all. Secondly - that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously. Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long-term contracts, what's driving that and finally, congratulations on hiring Amit, I think it's going to be great. Gina Mastantuono : So Kash, I'll start first on the strength of RPO. It repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter, but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only our portfolio of products getting larger and deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer. And that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth. We have really strong cRPO, but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter-after-quarter and that's testament to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers. And so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the board and that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO, but our RPO number, which is a really strong long-term measure of the health of our business. William McDermott : And I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it. RaptorDB, the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster think about bringing next-generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers. So the performance, the speed, the scale, as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts, platform buying. This is quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the Now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations and speed of execution. So all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks, and we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an upsell opportunity for every existing installation across the world for ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that it that people will invest in, but will be well worth it for the benefits they're going to get from it. And this will be an ongoing story as we continue to build it out. But remember one thing, it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass. No other company in the world could do that. And we believe that, that will give us a very exciting position for future growth, and we're super excited. And we're rolling it out now in Q4, and we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more. Kash Rangan : Thank you so much. William McDermott : Thank you very much, Kash. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulation on a great quarter. One question for Gina and one question for Bill. Gina, last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwind that came from the strong federal business last year. Given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year. I'm assuming those duration - or headwinds don't exist in Q3. So is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill. Agents kind of came on to the scene in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents. Does that change like the sales cycle at all about if we're like Now Assist in the Pro Plus SKU now that there's this new sort of technology people are talking about in terms of the agents? Or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation? William McDermott : Thank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does, if you're not yet a ServiceNow customer or you're thinking about Now Assist, it further cements your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future. So not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another upsell opportunity, and we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve almost any task you can possibly think of. And these partnerships that we've established with great companies like NVIDIA and building market-making solutions, for example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out-of-the-box type solution, I think, it is really pretty breathtaking. And at an architectural level, we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third-party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model, so this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster, but also integrate better. As I said many times, 85% of digital transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now everything integrates into one platform, and you turbocharge it with Now Assist in a Agentic AI and you're off to the races. Gina Mastantuono : And then, Keith, on your question on duration for cRPO from Fed. The mix we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as Fed kind of re-ups, but then you will see continued headwind quarter-over-quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense? Keith Weiss : Yes. So like on the duration-adjusted basis, Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter. Gina Mastantuono : That's exactly correct. Keith Weiss : Okay. Perfect. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Keith. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Brad Sills : Oh great. Thank you so much. A question on headcount here as well, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount outpace sales and marketing, historically, that was the opposite, and it looked pretty significant here by almost 2 :1 ratio there. So I guess the question is, what does that say about the business? Is the gating factor to growth here really just about your ability to get out more product in categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Yes. I'd say it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quota bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter-bearing sales at a really strong way. There's lots of marketing and sales operations headcount that we were we were building up as scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear. And I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing headcount was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things. With respect to R&D headcount, it's been pretty consistent. It's always been an area of huge focus for us. And certainly, in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that consistently been a place where we have invested and we'll continue to invest. And so from our perspective, headcount growth is always, first and foremost, allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent as well as feed on the street quota-bearing sales hitting road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest problems and you'll continue to see us do just that. Brad Sills : Wonderful. Thanks Gena. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Brad,. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Turrin : Hi. Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I know the numbers can bounce a bit, but we've seen - heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV, Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks. I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us. And maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks. William McDermott : Absolutely. Thank you very much, Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong. And we grew net new ACV over 50%, 5-0 percent, and it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued tracking in the front office has been going on for some time now, but we're getting known for it, and we're winning. We're winning a lot. So it's a healthy adoption of our Pro Plus offering. The industry SKUs are driving things, financial services was out in front for sure, technology and media, absolutely public sector. Technology and Media was over 300% public sector grew over 60% and the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at, it's really amazing from managed services providers to manufacturing, semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies. It's extremely, extremely exciting. And I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity. Just think about reduced time to quote higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero-touch provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that this will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow. Michael Turrin : That\u2019s all very clear. Thanks very much. William McDermott : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Great. Maybe I'll direct this to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware, there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the federal business, partly because of the issues that you Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft. I'm wondering if you could hit that - hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good Fed bookings over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. William McDermott : Sure, Karl. We didn't see any impact in Q3, and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the U.S. federal business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And as I look at the business in Fed, it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic. We had five deals greater than $5 a couple of deals over $20 million, and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. That's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind. I know because I've been there with the U.S. federal government agencies, they're looking for efficiency gains, and they know our software platform does it. They also know the implementations are stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our cooling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive, it's all working for us. And I'm very, very excited about our Gen AI SKUs for our government Community Cloud. As you know, that went generally available recently, it was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal, and we partnered Accenture as a matter of fact, to kick off a 60-day pilot with 1 agency and they ended it early to get into the Gen AI race because it works so well. So everything is thumbs up here, Karl, and I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you. Karl Keirstead : Okay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks Bill. William McDermott : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Gregg Moskowitz : All right. Thank you very much for taking my question. So the growth for Now Assist and Pro Plus has obviously been highly impressive. But we've also been hearing about a real up-tick in customers choosing to upgrade from Standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards Gen AI adoption and obviously, that driving ARPU - uplift as well. So Bill, when you look across your installed base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with these set of customers going forward? William McDermott : Absolutely. I do, Gregg, I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you now add the Now Assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink, because the returns to them are so much greater than any pricing. And we're a very fair company in the way we do things, and it's highly transparent. I see a plus up with that. I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally, because it's such a sensation. People see the clock speed of how the system runs on it, they all want it. And Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic great engineering built into it amazing. We really hit it with our database and our, I would say, first round draft choice team that built this, it's really, really something to behold. So I am feeling extremely good. And the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow, and they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoint, its real products doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited, Gregg. Gregg Moskowitz : Fantastic. Thank you, Bill. William McDermott : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Wood with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Derek Wood : Thanks. Bill, really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents, just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these Agentic networks. It sounds like it's from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, zero-copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LOMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming GA. William McDermott : Yes. Sure. Well, first of all, I think there's really three areas that that I would highlight for you are my top three, if that helps, just put this into some context. The Gen AI race is one that we're winning, first mover, and we intend to run the table. So Now Assist is the sensation and GenAI on the Now Platform because of the uniqueness of this platform, and its perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts, and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB it really is magnificent. Now you put RaptorDB. So Now Assist is priority one, you put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform, again, if that workflow data platform, which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform, what customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise, structured or unstructured data, to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest TAM and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that, that can be like a major catalyst. And in terms of when the product is coming, they're out. So you got Now Assist in full flight, you've got RaptorDB in full flight, Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now, and it will continue to evolve and be a big part of our future and you have the front office where wins are happening every day, and we're beautifully led there, and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the and the cross-sells cohorts that Gina talked about, and it's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start-up. And that's kind of motion that's running through ServiceNow, now. And tomorrow, when we get to ServiceNow Live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter, I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world. Derek Wood : Fantastic. Thanks. William McDermott : Thank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talked about a lot of like C-level executives, how do they think about like AI as we go into next year in terms of - is that like coming out of the IT budget? Did you do a second budget? And how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you. William McDermott : Yes. I think the good news - the really good news here, Raimo, is IT budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And we really work hard on studying the world around us. And Gartner expects global IT spending to grow almost 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023. And it expects software to grow at 15%. And the secular tailwinds GenAI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities, and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers focused on digital transformation within the IT budget. It's growing. We're getting more share because clearly, we're gaining share because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about. And we're gaining share. But I also think there is new share to be gained from more investment, and really believe when I talk to the CEOs, IT is clearly their business focus within IT. Gen AI is their number one focus. And they are going to get the money from somewhere. And if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will. So on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around Gen AI. And I also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where is the new money coming from? We had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250-point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache, but there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future. And the future is Now \u2013 N-O-W, no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow. IT, other line item budgets coming in, and of course, the consolidation to a premier platform like this. Incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly. And we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels and how the channels are now leaning in and building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all that says growth. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. Congrats. William McDermott : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that Amit has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about this big AI boom period for ServiceNow. And related, just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and join how will they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role? William McDermott : That's a really great question, Samad. How I learned about that was actually in a live interview with Amit. And we talked about his past and everything that he's done, and he called that out as a unique professional, I guess, strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done and I see that as a skill that will help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at. And that's what you always try to do. You always try to hire great human beings, first of all, and he and he is one with a hungry humble heart, has one but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way. In terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer. We need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, build comradery with the best engineering team in the business, which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens, which he has from all of his experiences. So I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring Amit on. And we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places, including Oracle and obviously, Google with the Google Cloud platform. And as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual, it's also good for the company he came from and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of Amit and a conversation that we had. It was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good. And we want to do good because we believe good wins. Samad Samana : Exciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team. William McDermott : Thank you so much, Samad. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Good bye. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Abby, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ServiceNow Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darren Yip, Group Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Insights. You may begin. Darren Yip : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2024 results and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2025. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William McDermott : Thank you, Darren. Good afternoon, and thank you very much for joining today's call. There are two big themes I'll cover. The first, is ServiceNow's outstanding business fundamentals. We'll discuss another quarterly result that beat expectations driving our remaining performance obligation to nearly $23 billion, and a platinum balance sheet with $10 billion in cash and investments on hand. We are one of one, a 20% plus grower at scale with margin accretion, printing free cash operating at the Rule of 54. We blew through our original $10 billion dream, and now we're on track for our mid-term target of $15 billion plus by 2026, with a long-term vision to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. The second theme is ServiceNow\u2019s leadership position in the seismic shift to a genetic AI. Stunning 150% quarter-over-quarter deal growth in our key Pro Plus AI offerings is an exciting sign of what's ahead, especially, with the new innovations we announced today. It doesn't matter to ServiceNow, who builds the models with the precipitous drop in LLM compute costs, there is much more capital allocation available for the business impact layer. Our position at the center of data, AI agents, workflow orchestration and enterprise governance is the nexus of AI's massive value creation opportunity. Let's talk about the business fundamentals first. You'll recall that during the course of 2024, we consistently beat expectations and raised our guidance twice. In Q4, our biggest quarter of the year, we exceeded expectations on top of that beat and raise track record. Subscription revenue growth was 21%, CRPO growth was 22%, that's double IDC's 2024 growth rate for the IT sector. Operating margin was 29.5%. Each of those results was 50 basis points above the high end of our guidance. So two was our full year 2024 free cash flow margin of 31.5%. In terms of the shape of the business, ServiceNow continues its enterprise platform expansion. We had 19 deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV. We landed our largest new logo deal ever. We had two additional customers cross the $100 million in total ACV, doubling our total in one quarter. It's clear that our AI platform message is landing and it's scaling. On the product areas, 76 of our tech workflow deals were over $1 million, including one over 15 million, ITSM, ITOM and ITAM and Security and Risk were all in at least 15 of the top 20 deals. IT asset management was actually in all of our top 20. Customer and industry workflows more on this later, continued its disruption of the category with 30 deals over $1 million. Employee and creative workflows, both had very good quarters with at least 17 deals, each over $1 million. We're very proud of ServiceNow's performance in 2024. No enterprise software company has ever executed at this scale the way we have. You'll hear from Gina on the 2025 guide in a few minutes. To say, we expect another great year is a given. This is consistent with how we have guided the business in recent years when you'll recall, we consistently overachieved our stated goals. Even on this bigger revenue base, be assured, we will save the innovative fast growth highly profitable company we are today. Let's spend some time on AI. I gave you the 150% quarter-over-quarter result. This is the number of customer deals for the AI fueled Pro Plus level in our ITSM, CSM and HRSD solutions. Let's go a level deeper. IDC forecasts worldwide revenue for AI platforms software will grow to $153 billion in 2028, with a 40.6% CAGR during that period. For 2025 alone, they forecast 46% growth in AI software spending. With this secular strength, AI is fueling a top to bottom reordering of the enterprise technology landscape. You've seen the impact of this in energy, infrastructure and hardware. You'll now see it even more in software. Every CEO I meet wants to simplify their business to unlock the heaviness of legacy architectures. They want to innovate with data workflows and agentic AI. ServiceNow is winning with 1,000 customers on the Agentic AI journey already. Here's why? First, ServiceNow has the AI agents, the workflows, the workflow data fabric, Raptor DB and the integration hub in one platform at scale. The majority in enterprise software is struggling with their well-known integration challenges and in some cases, exaggerating the readiness of incremental progress. Second, ServiceNow has thousands of AI agents, leveraging 20 years of automation, data and outcomes. This is knowledge gleaned from trillions of workflows we run, including billions of automation, knowledge sources and tools. We've been building an agentic architecture. For the five plus years I've been the CEO and lockstep with Jensen Wang and our great friends at NVIDIA. Third, since enterprises will experiment with more than one vendor's agents, ServiceNow's platform handles orchestration and governance. Nobody wants a new cloud mess where every department is out buying agents and nobody understands what the agents are doing. Our AI agent orchestrator eliminates sprawl, managing teams of AI agents to tackle the most complex enterprise processes. Even as we reach new buyers, like Chief Data and AI officers, ServiceNow's role as the CIO's control plane is the ultimate move in enterprise AI. If you haven't seen Idris Elba's latest brand work for ServiceNow, you can check it out on servicenow.com or on the ServiceNow YouTube channel. The theme is every corner of your office. Our differentiation goes east to west, and north to south. And here's what this all means for our business. We are only getting started. The opportunity is in its early days. The unique agility of our business model sets us up for a quantum leap and future business growth. We have predicted and protected that are seat based subscription staying as is a foundation you can feel secure in. We have also included a massive upgrade path to Pro Plus, RaptorDB and Workflow Data Fabric. So seat based subscription still there, rock solid, not going anywhere. Then we have these massive upgrade paths to the new innovation. Customers still like the predictability of this approach, and they're committed to long-term transformation on our platform. Now we are also enabling elements of consumption based pricing, as AI agents become a potent value driver for the enterprise. While we could have launched an additional SKU and offered AI agents as an add-on to drive more immediate revenue growth, our strategy prioritizes accelerating adoption. So by foregoing upfront incremental new subscriptions, we are enabling faster penetration into our customer base and monetizing the hockey stick of usage over time. As the agents become increasingly productive they will drive the consumption pricing meter. And that, of course, will be in addition to the seat based licensing foundation, you'll get both. The consumption of assists with agentic AI will be a multiple factor higher than that of a standard Now Assist query. This approach ensures customers can access our AI capabilities as quickly and as seamlessly as possible, while simplifying the sales process at the same time. This is the most transformative technology in decades. We are solidifying our leadership position as the AI platform for business transformation. The bedrock strength of this business model is built on driving the success of our customers. Some examples include Petrobras works with ServiceNow connecting data across more than 6,000 applications and catalog items, processing over 250,000 requests monthly to improve decision making and governance. A large DoD agency works with ServiceNow, getting immediate visibility into critical data and assets previously trapped in manual processes and outdated legacy systems. New Zealand Parliamentary service is using ServiceNow to reduce employee request response times from weeks to two days. And our largest non-profit deal to-date, Scouting America will leverage the ServiceNow platform to digitally transform its legacy HR and customer service processes with AI. Grupo Bimbo will revolutionize its factory operations using ServiceNow to get real-time insights and boost production efficiency. Toyota, Rolls-Royce, the federal service desk, NTT Data, they all work with ServiceNow to put AI to work for people. As always, there's so much more to give you a complete picture of ServiceNow's progress. We told you about the launch of Workflow Data Fabric, which is significantly expanding ServiceNow's addressable market. The increasing traction on agentic AI is surging awareness of workflow data fabric and our RaptorDB, Pro offering with new customers like NTT signing this quarter. We're further augmenting Data Fabric capabilities with the new Oracle and Google Cloud integrations announced earlier today. In terms of our key strategic industries, the public sector is poised for a major modernization effort this year and beyond. The United States government alone spends $125 billion a year on IT, much of which is unauditable not cataloged and not tracked against actual usage. That's why we're so enthusiastic on the new Department of Government Efficiency mandate from President Trump. If you look at our track record across all federal government customers. ServiceNow is saving millions and millions in costs through efficiency improvements and millions and millions of hours by automating mind numbing work. There's so much more we will do to help. In terms of our partner ecosystem, there is growth happening everywhere. ServiceNow and AWS expanded our collaboration with new capabilities to accelerate AI transformation. This enables use of multimodal models developed on Amazon Bedrock and additional solutions are available on the AWS marketplace. ServiceNow and Google Cloud are expanding our partnership to deliver AI-powered tools to millions of users. ServiceNow will launch on Google Cloud Marketplace, and Google distributed cloud to address demand from global enterprises. ServiceNow and Visa are expanding our strategic alliance yet again. Visa will use ServiceNow disputes management, built with Visa's solution and together with ServiceNow, we combine AI capabilities. ServiceNow and Five9 expanded our partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified experiences. The streamlined solution reduces operational costs, increases agent efficiency and simplifies contact center operations. ServiceNow and Microsoft are expanding our alliance to accelerate disruption in the CRM category. This is built on Microsoft CoPilot and ServiceNow AI agent collaboration, leveraging the unique strengths of both platforms. It's a good time to remind you at CRM and industry workflows is ServiceNow's fastest growing business. There's a reason for that. ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to take action and fully automate workflows across the enterprise. We have a key differentiator at the architectural level. We don't have to try to translate between our AI models and some third-party system. We sell, fulfill and service on one platform, one architecture and one data model, absolute beauty. Other software vendors need to communicate across multiple systems and stitch them together to make their software work, resulting in poor customer experiences saddled with technical debt. We're just a front-end AI agent. A customer is limited in their ability to take action across the enterprise to drive the ticket to resolution. ServiceNow enables AI agents to seamlessly collaborate across the entire enterprise with our single database and single architecture. Our peers, agents perform simple tasks while our AI agents work together and leverage the entire system to solve complex tasks and enable true business transformation. We know that agentic AI promises exponential increase on the ServiceNow platform, this is an exponential increase in seamless automation. On a fragmented platform like many others, there will be an exponential increase in complexity and failure rates. Autonomous AI running on a fragile foundation bespoke integrations between disparate systems is a recipe for exponential disaster. Industry analysts have acknowledged ServiceNow's completeness of vision. ServiceNow is named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for the CRM Customer Engagement Center. ServiceNow is also recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave task-centric automation software. The global marketplace is noticing too, just today's ServiceNow was recognized as number two on Fortune's world's most admired software companies and even better. We were number one in innovation and number one for building a people-first culture. Forbes named ServiceNow is the number two on the first ever most trusted companies list right behind NVIDIA, pretty good company, if you ask me. The American Opportunity Index, which ranks companies based on creating opportunity for their employees, ranked ServiceNow in the top five in the world, number one in software. These are just some of the many awards, all of which are rooted in a world class team that is completely obsessed with serving our customers. In summary, ServiceNow is full speed ahead. We are putting AI to work for people, our innovation, growth, profitability and brand leadership position us as a class of one in enterprise software. The market is moving with ServiceNow. With this combination of start-up passion and scale maturity, we have the right strategy to deliver immense shareholder value in the years to come, that's why I keep reminding our team, our $15 billion plus by 2026 midterm guidance is only one chapter on our path to $30 billion plus in revenue and beyond. When the world works with ServiceNow imagination is the limit. Thank you all for your time and confidence. Before we take questions, I'll hand things over to our President and Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono. She will illuminate our unique ability to sustain profitable revenue growth, even as we add the revenue equivalent of like a number six scaled market-leading software company on top of ServiceNow every year. Pretty exciting stuff. Gina, over to you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q4 was a great quarter, capping a year of incredible innovation and execution. Once again, we exceeded all of our constant currency growth and profitability guidance metrics, demonstrating the strength of our platform and the extraordinary efforts of our team. 2024 was a pivotal year in driving customer adoption of our generative AI solutions. By embedding powerful AI capabilities into our offerings, we've enabled organizations to reimagine how work is done, unlocking new levels of efficiency, creativity and value. Customers across industries are embracing these solutions at a rapid pace proving the immense opportunity, AI and data bring to our business. Turning to our results. Q4 subscription revenues were $2.866 billion, growing 21% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 50 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $22.3 billion, representing 26% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was $10.27 billion, representing 22% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 50 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, manufacturing posted impressive growth, surpassing 50% year-over-year. Public sector grew nearly 40% year-over-year, driven by the strength in U.S. federal and state and local government. Transportation and Logistics also reported significant growth during the quarter. We delivered a very strong 98% renewal rate in Q4, highlighting the trust and value customers consistently place in the Now platform. The number of customers generating over $1 million in ACV rose to 2,109, even more remarkable, the number of customers contributing $20 million or more in ACV was 35% year-over-year, fueled by continued success in securing large deals. We ended the year with approximately 8,400 customers as our strategic focus on landing the right new customers continues to deliver results. The average deal size of our new logos has consistently grown, marking the sixth consecutive year of expansion. And in Q4, we landed our largest new logo deal in company history. We closed 170 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including 15 with new logos. What's more impressive is that 19 of these deals exceeded $5 million and three deals were over $20 million. Our Gen AI net new ACV to date continues to trend ahead of any new product family launch for the comparable period in our history. In fact, Gen AI net new ACV stepped up meaningfully in Q4 from Q3 as we saw momentum accelerate for our Plus SKUs. As Bill noted, the number of Now Assist service desk deals, which include ITSM, CSM and HRSD grew over 150% quarter-over-quarter. Furthermore, the number of customers who bought two or more of our Gen AI capabilities doubled quarter-over-quarter. Our Plus SKUs also maintained a greater than 30% price uplift over Pro in Q4, a strong indication of the tremendous value they deliver. For example, a multinational conglomerate customers are a 45% reduction in live chat from July to December with Now Assist and the company is now targeting to save millions by the end of 2025. For the addition of our AI agents to many of these SKUs, we think the value proposition becomes even more compelling in 2025. We're also seeing great early traction with our RaptorDB Pro offering. Since the announcement in just September, we already have five customers over $1 million in ACV, a leading multinational technology company that adopted RaptorDB Pro in Q4 is already achieving performance improvements that exceed expectations, with database response times up to 3.5 times faster than previous benchmarks and a database size reduction of over 30%, driving significant cost savings. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.5%, driven by OpEx efficiencies and our top line outperformance. Our free cash flow margin was 47.5%. For full year 2024, operating margin was 29.5%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, and free cash flow margin was 31.5%, 50 basis points above our guidance and up 100 basis points year-over-year. Total free cash flow for 2024 was a robust $3.5 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet of $10 billion in cash and investments. In Q4, we bought back approximately 293,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $266 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Given our strong cash position and our strategy of managing the impact of dilution, we announced today that the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $3 billion of common stock under this program. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our outlook. As we enter 2025, we're not just planning to win today, we're making bold strategic decisions to position ourselves for sustainable strong growth in the years ahead. This year, we will incorporate more elements of consumption based monetization across our AI and data solutions. For instance, we will include AI agents and our Plus SKUs for going upfront incremental new subscriptions to instead drive even faster adoption and monetize the hockey stick of usage over time. We're optimizing our go-to-market approach and evolving our business model to create even more integrated solutions and sees the massive agentic AI and data opportunity in front of us. Our guidance prudently reflects the flexibility to make these moves while delivering higher incremental free cash flow building on the accelerated margin trajectory created by our outstanding 2024 outperformance. With that in mind, for 2025, we expect subscription revenues between $12.635 billion and $12.675 billion, representing 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint in a constant currency basis. This reflects an incremental $175 million FX headwind since the end of September and assumes a more pronounced back half weighted seasonal linearity in our U.S. federal business due to the change in the presidential administration. We expect subscription gross margin of 83.5%, reflecting the diminishing impact of the change in useful life of our data center equipment as well as incremental data center investments related to public cloud partners, geo expansion, and AI. We expect an operating margin of 30.5%, up 100 basis points year-over-year driven by OpEx leverage across the board, including sales and marketing. We expect free cash flow margin of 32%. This reflects an incremental 50 basis points of margin expansion on top of our 2024 outperformance and in spite of an incremental cash tax headwind of 100 basis points year-over-year. And we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $210 million. For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $2.995 billion and $3 billion, representing 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. This reflects an incremental $40 million FX headwind since the end of September and the previously noted Fed seasonality assumptions. We expect CRPO growth of 20.5% on a constant currency basis. I would note that CRPO saw an incremental $205 million FX headwind since the end of September. We expect an operating margin of 30%, and we expect $210 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, 2024 was an amazing year, but we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. Our ability to seamlessly orchestrate and govern AI agents, coupled with our unified data architecture positions us uniquely to bring all your data, people and processes onto a single platform so you can take action on it. The moves we're making in 2025 aren't just about maintaining our lead, they're about expanding it. We're setting ourselves up to define the future of agent powered automation, solidify ServiceNow as the AI platform for business transformation and deliver strong growth year-after-year. Finally, Bill and I want to express our deepest gratitude to our employees around the world for their unwavering hard work and dedication. You are the heart of our success. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Wow. What a superb quarter and a fiscal year end as well. Bill, a question for you. Can you talk a little bit more about your decision to do a hybrid consumption and subscription? And the reason behind your confidence that you can walk both those tracks very well. And Gina, if you could do a pro forma, had you not done the consumption? What would the subscription revenue growth outlook would have been hypothetically? Thank you once again. Congratulations. William McDermott : Thank you so much, Kash. Our goal is to combine both subscription and consumption pricing. So customers can start with a base subscription, which they like. They want that flag in the ground, so they can predict their spend and their current ROI schemes. But then, they obviously want to take advantage of agentic AI and yet at the same time, the industry is early in its formation. So we're actually innovating faster than they have deployed it. So they want to scale with us in harmony and in partnership. So with our Pro Plus version, they'll get access to our agentic AI agents and will give them a meter based pricing methodology where they will take out the sole crushing business process work that is tedious and complex that people actually don't even want to do and agentic AI agents will do that for them. They will see a very nice ROI on that. And by definition, if the meter is running up, that means they're using it and deriving financial gain from it, and they're happy to pay and share with us the profits. So in a certain sense, cash, it's the Goldilocks model where you get it both ways. You get the same revenue and predictability you've been used to. But now we have a hockey stick formation that can turn into a sensational growth shoot for the company. So I think we really got this right and with Amit's leadership and our great engineering team, the way we're pressing innovation into the market is truly, truly stunning, and I'm so, so excited. I just want to give you one thought that nobody ever talks about. And that is, no matter where you travel in the world, and I just got done with a global road show, there are millions of technical jobs that go unfilled year-after-year. With agentic AI agents, you can now fill those jobs and at the same time, improve human productivity and the productivity curve of these businesses in a dramatic way. And nobody actually talks about there not being any such thing as artificial intelligence without human intelligence. And that's why we are putting AI to work for people, and that has landed in a very pleasant way with our customer relationships. So everything we're doing is on the right side of customer success. Amit Zavery : So \u2013 hey, Kash, thanks for the question. This is Amit here. Just to add to what Bill was saying. The way we are thinking about this, the Pro Plus we have 1,000 plus customers already who will be able to now take advantage of the innovation we're bringing out with agentic, and it is subscription. So they're still paying for that kind of capacity. If they go beyond the capacity and the assist, which is the meter gap capacity, if they go beyond that, they're still buying assist packs. So it's not like one assist per time in terms of consumption. So it's not really subscription packs in a way, but just that they can now go and tier those things much more easily versus having to do everything upfront, right? So they get the predictability and the confidence of the usage and the value and they grow with it. And they assist with a genetic really scales very, very fast because each assist -- each agentic call requires many assets. So we just started getting them seeded and get going and the subscriptions really keep on growing as they start using more and more. So it's not completely like pay as you go per meet per individual assist. It's really packs of assist in a way. So subscription pricing and we are giving them some flexibility as well and then giving the ability for customers to see value instantly. Gina Mastantuono : And then on the second part of your question, Kash, as always, we're beginning the year with a thoughtful guide, right, that sets a strong foundation for success. And I talked about two factors that we prudently factored into our guide. We just talked about the monetization of the agentic AI. I won't go into that further because I think Bill and Amit explained it quite clearly. The other piece is that we anticipate a more back-end weighted deal linearity in 2025 for federal, reflecting the outcome of the U.S. election. And so what I\u2019d say is that we\u2019re giving you a 20% constant currency guide while derisking the guidance. And to your question on what would it be if we didn\u2019t do that, I would say higher. Kash Rangan : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Murphy : Thank you so much. So Bill, regarding the DeepSeek models, I'm very interested how you're assessing this moment where we have a Chinese AI model. It seems to perform well at a fraction of the cost, and I'm curious, if it's something like DeepSeek, is that an option for ServiceNow or is it too risky with the data protections? And just more broadly, what do you think ServiceNow can do to exert its leadership as this cost of one of your input costs, which is the underlying models, it seems like it's starting to drop at a faster pace. William McDermott : Yeah. Thank you very much for the question, Mark. It's actually a fantastic news for ServiceNow because as these models are being commoditized at a rapid rate and probably more rapid than anyone could have dreamed of. It's super, super exciting for platform. and app vendors like us since the competitive differentiation will happen at our level in terms of the applications, the business processes, how you can help these companies run better and then ultimately get a business outcome. And again, what I think helps us a lot financially, you can see the gross margin benefit of that, but you can also see our customers that have been investing in these LLMs, getting a lot better deal now, so they kind of past the hardware, the infrastructure and the LLM and that price is dropping on everything, they'll have more left over to invest in ServiceNow. But we're truly set ServiceNow apart is our platform's ability to orchestrate and operationalize AI to create meaningful outcomes. So our customers are using ServiceNow to turn these AI insights into real tangible actions whether it's automating workflows, resolving issues proactively or enhancing productivity across the enterprise. And as it relates to DeepSeek, I would just simply say, we have a deep belief here in basically measuring twice, if not 3 times in counting once. So we believe very strongly in understanding what's really going on, and we're highly committed to responsible AI, and I know Amit and his team are taking a look at that right now. Amit Zavery : Yeah. To add to what Bill said. We definitely are going to -- we are supporting third-party large language models. And we continue to work with many of those providers and doing a lot of integration with those technologies as well. The way we've architected our platform today, it's very easy for us to keep on adding any innovation which happens in that place and give that outcome from our applications. So it's really the combination of workflows with AI and the data is what our power is. And we would take any technologies out there, which helps our customer and get them the best outcome. So that's really the goal, and we continue to work with all the large language providers, and we will look at DeepSeek. We already have teams kind of investigating that. But the goal is that architecturally, we can support everything out there as needed. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Gina Mastantuono : And then Mark, on the cost side -- on the cost side, I would just say, this is not unexpected. We've been talking about the innovation and investing in innovation in AI for quite a while, and yet we continue to accrete margins. Our guide next year is for 100 basis points on operating and 50 basis points on free cash flow on top of overachieving in '24. And so really great cost discipline at ServiceNow while we continue to out innovate. Mark Murphy : Well, congrats on having that foresight in delivering that efficiency and thank you, for taking my question. William McDermott : Thank you, Mark. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh : Thank you for taking the questions. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. Bill, when you think about this year, I kind of have sympathy for a lot of enterprise customers, every vendor in software is going to be pushing their agentic capabilities. So Bill, could you just detail a little bit about your agent strategy in that more fragmented landscape, what's going to give ServiceNow, the license to win? And also importantly, what are you contemplating from a go-to-market change perspective that's associated with this move to agents and the move to a hybrid subscription/consumption model? William McDermott : Yeah. I think the number one most important thing is our AI orchestration serves as the control tower for business transformation. And if you think about our core strength in IT, and how we handle all things IT from servicing the business, running the operations, the assets, the security of it all, and then moving into the employee and the experience and giving them all the things they need and think about the customer, it's literally sell, fulfill and service all on one platform. And then from a creator perspective, with natural language wiping out 60% of the productivity drag to actually get them to doing the code and inventing something. We're handling all of that today on one platform with one architecture and one data model. So we'll give you our agentic AI solution in all of those domains. But best of all, because everyone is pounding them with their siloed solutions, it's become highly credible to customers that somebody has to be the controller or the orchestrator for all of these other agents as well if they decide to implement them. And as soon as they see the architectural advantage of what ServiceNow has. They say, I go for this one. And there's another thing that's happening in combination, thanks to Amit and the great engineering here. We now have RaptorDB, and I do remind you that Amit had an amazing career at Oracle before GCP. So he understands all of this at a very deep technical level. And frankly, we have some amazing talent in our company on database. And RaptorDB is a sensation, not only in its speed and its ability to be fully automated on the ServiceNow instance and make big companies go 3 times or 5 times faster, but we also now have connectors into Snowflake, into data bricks, into Oracle, into all of the hyperscalers, including the announcement today with GCP, we had AWS and Microsoft. Interestingly, AWS is number one and number four biggest deal ever in the enterprise, with ServiceNow customers running in AWS. So they know us well. Everybody knows us really well. So now you're controlling east to west and you're going north to south up and down the stack, and then you ultimately integrate in all these systems of record where we have been moving that data into ServiceNow for years. But with RaptorDB, some customers are saying, well, why don't I just move it all into ServiceNow and skip the fragmented step of hundreds of broken fragmented installs that have been put in there departmentally over the last 55 years. And we tell them, have it your way. You want to leave the data where it is, we'll make a zero copy. You want to move it into ServiceNow, that's fine, too. You want to run it in the hyperscalers, including running your ServiceNow instance with some customers want to do, we let you do that, too. And as Amit said, we already integrate with all the LLMs. So I mean, seriously, if I'm sitting back as the CEO, I spoke with one that runs the largest insurance company in Asia, and I think that I'm going into an insurance call telling them how we can improve insurance claims and all this sort of stuff, and he said, Bill, I want to be a data company. Actually, I don\u2019t want to rely on the old business model of my agents shaking everyone's hands. I want agentic AI to do that. I want to be a retail company. And then I explain our story and he tells me I have no idea. I said, well, we're still a young company, but now that you do, what do you want to do about it? I want to go with you. I said, great, I'll send them the team. Let's get it done. So when they hear this story properly presented, it's game set match. So our challenge is just simply to help you and the media and the customers get the memo because once you get the memo, this is the only viable option. Sanjit Singh : I appreciate the vision, Bill. Thank you so much. William McDermott : Thank you so much. Appreciate the question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matthew Hedberg : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats as well and Gina, congrats on your expanded role. Really great to see that. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you, Matt. Matthew Hedberg : Bill, so obviously, a lot of -- Bill, obviously, a lot of enthusiasm on AI, which is great to hear. Just given your global perspective, you have such a good pulse on overall IT spending trends. Did you see things improve from what we last talked on September results? And how do you feel at this point versus, say, this point last year, like, are things improving out there in general? William McDermott : I think that -- Matt, thank you for the question, by the way. And I couldn't agree with you more on Gina's promotion. She is stunningly fantastic and it's an honor to work with her and has been for the five years we've been together, and I'm just so proud to see her richly rewarded for what she deserves as a leader. So I think it's great and congrats, Gina. On the IT spending environment, I think it's similar in the IT spending environment to what it's been. But I do think the big change is the move from AI fascination to AI business model innovation. And it's clear to me that the best CEOs in the world have AI at the forefront of their mind. In fact, I actually see them even extracting AI from the CIO and the CTO remit, and it's not because they don't respect or really take pride in their CIOs and CTOs, but they believe they have to be AI-led companies. And so they're actually creating AI leadership and data leadership within the construct model of their org charts and those individuals are showing up in their boardrooms because these CEOs really understand that if they don't capitalize on this moment and they end up with second mover advantage. It might be a liability. So they're really on their tippy toes. And therefore, if you have a great agentic AI story, you plant that flag in the essence of a great business model like we have, and you do the end model on what Amit very appropriately said on our agentic AI portfolio with Now Assist and you have a win-win relationship on consumption, value, and we both benefit from that. It is an extremely pleasing story. And on that dimension, they will open up the pocketbook and that is the key because they're getting value from it. And the other piece is, in the public sector, I see a complete renaissance happening which I think is truly outstanding. Nowhere in the world do I go where they don't want to talk about those and what's happening in America. And so the administration has done a very good job of getting everybody aware that something big is happening here. And because we have such a strong foothold in the agencies, in the military establishments and the defense establishments from all of them that you can possibly think of that really matter, including veterans, affairs, we have a great reputation. And so they know when we come in, we make work simple for people. And so if you think about sending everybody back to the office and telling them good luck, you're going to announce swivel chair between 17 different application experiences, which will eat up a 30 (ph) productivity a day, they'll probably take the package and leave. So the ServiceNow solution becomes even more relevant. And the fact that we could take cost out, bring productivity in and inspire the best in people is extremely inspiring. The other thing that's really inspiring, and this is true in the private sector too, but in the public sector, they know they're inheriting more than half a century of disasters. So they're not interested in the rip and replace. They're also not interested in layering silos. They really want to rethink how things are running. So because we can extract the data from the systems they have. We have RaptorDB and the connections to all the best companies in the world, and we could orchestrate the AI transformation. They\u2019re like, how do we get started? Because only you guys came in here with a price that I can afford, and you\u2019re going to have me up and running in weeks instead of years and congressional trips. So we\u2019re a whole different allocator when it comes to serving the government than anyone else. Matthew Hedberg : Great answer. Thanks, Bill. Best of luck. William McDermott : Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Matt. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Wonderful. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around customer employee workflow. It continues to represent a real key source of incremental growth. We certainly hear about real strong traction in the channel, is there anything to call out there? There's a lot in those two offerings. So would love to get any thoughts from you on what's driving the strength there? And my notion is that perhaps Now Assist is starting to kind of pull customers into those applications? Are you seeing any kind of halo effect or pull-through, if you will, as customers are getting ready for Now Assist in those categories? Thank you. William McDermott : Yeah. It's a great question. Brad, the whole agentic AI revolution is a lot like the chicken and the egg, right? Is the agentic AI pulling the core or is the core pulling agentic AI? In our case, both are working for each other, which is truly a beautiful thing. If you look at customer workflows, they're performing extremely well, as I said that, and the industry workflows are the fastest growing in the company. And in most cases, when you talk about CRM, you're personalizing that to an industry and a specific use case, which is perfect for us. And if you think about it, field service management, a really incredible quarter, large DoD agency, multinational imaging and electronics company, a European health care company, a semiconductor manufacturer, air transportation, communications and IT top energy. I mean I can go on with the list. Suffice it to say this and I want you to register this carefully. We have the best CRM solution in the market. CRM is not SFA. CRM is how do I sell to you in every channel, how do I fulfill what I sold to you and how ultimately do I service you and we can do it on one platform. And our unfair advantage in IT is, we know all the assets, we know all the operations, we know all the customer stuff in the ServiceNow platform today. And now that we can sell fulfill and service on one platform, the world is standing up and taking notice. They have had it with literally, in some cases, big companies. They have hundreds of disparate implementations from different suppliers out there that are not integrated to begin with, but when they're not even on the same instance, can you imagine the chaos. So this is extremely pleasing. We're going to run the table and it's going to be a big, big thing. And that's where we're seeing tremendous uptake in agentic AI. I want to tell you a story about ServiceNow because we drink our own champagne. Hear me out on this. We have AI agents servicing 85% of customer self-service in the company. We're automating 37% of our customer support case workflow through routing categorization and similarity detection. And agentic AI is transforming complex incident data into automated requests. It saved us 400,000 labor hours already. And we have 80% case deflection in the last six months. I'm not talking chatbots here. We have them six years ago. I'm talking agentic AI agents, and they're driving developer productivity by more than 20%. And here's the big thing on go-to-market, which I think a lot of people find interesting. The AI agents are helping to increase our prospect conversion rate by up to 16x and that's because they can curate the best leads based on the heuristics of all the data sources and put the top ones in front of the rep so they could sell more. And I could just tell you like seeing things going 99% fast to the customers answer and going from four day response to 8 seconds, is something that a lot of customers are getting excited about. So we have now on now here, a great team that does it. We did 8,500 now on now engagement with customers last year. It's estimated this year, we'll do 20,000. And with regard to the employee, from recruiting, hiring and onboarding to providing all the services, just think about combining all the functions of a company to serve the employee and everything on the mobile but you get to know them so well, you're actually pushing solutions to them. They don't have to ask for it. But when they do ask for it, it's instantaneous. And this is freeing up 3 million hours of capability within ServiceNow. So literally, when Gina talks about \u2013 we just did 200 basis points of [Operator Instructions] margin improvement we\u2019re thinking about more of the same because we run the whole company on ServiceNow. And where we do have a system of record somewhere, it\u2019s literally, you have to go into the basement and take the elevator down like several floors to find it. Nobody even knows. So this is a whole different way of approaching enterprise software. Brad Sills : Super exciting. Thank you, Bill. William McDermott : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. Gina, I'll echo the congrats very well heard. Bill, maybe first a question for you. Just you mentioned now a couple of times how the deflation in costs at the computing level will unlock budgets in the application layer and the platform layer, like for ServiceNow. I'm just curious if we've been getting feedback from either early customers or those that were in the pipeline that there is a budget constraint or a tough decision as being having to be made, and that's what's leading to that confidence in the unlock or is it more of just a high-level observation. Just maybe help us understand what gives you that confidence that those dollars will shift over and have you already seen a change in the conversation? William McDermott : I think the conversations are clearly -- and they have been for some time now. There's no magic ones here. It's all -- you've got to work hard. And working hard means, the industry, you have the best-in-class solution. You have a well composed design thinking, business case. Is it desirable? Is the dream there? Is it feasible? And meaning can you do it in the right amount of time. And then ultimately, as a viable, does it have the return on investment that customers need to say, yes. And you can't skip steps in this process. You have to do it the right way. But what agentic AI does is it opens up a fundamental reinvention of the business model and how you can innovate entire corporations. Just think about entire corporations rethinking what business they're in, what industry they're in, what offerings they can give to the customer, that's on the revenue side. But on the finance side, why do I need to hire X thousands people? Why don't I just put these agents to work to complement the people I already have or perhaps as I attract people I don't backfill them. I backfilled them with agents and my revenue per employee explodes through the roof. So I got you on the margin and I got you on the growth. And that's why I am a guy that truly believes that this revolution is even greater than the Internet, it's even greater than the cloud and the iPhone moment with mobile business because it encompasses all of them. And that's why it's a $20 trillion GDP movement between now and 2030 based on the business impact it has. It's a 1 :5 ratio. For every $1 wisely invested in AI, you'll get $5 on the other side. So it really does come down to proving that your tech is there, your understanding of the business is there. The value is there. And once that's clear, there's nothing standing in the way of a decision that says, let's go. Samad Samana : That's great. And Gina, maybe a follow-up for you. Just I think there is already a consent development. I think early on in the Pro Plus SKU, where if there's a certain amount of other tokens or coins associated. What have you observed from the early cohorts of customers. How many ended up getting into a level where it required the consumptive element? And maybe just help us think about how that will impact CRPO or what goes into CRPO going forward? Gina Mastantuono : So Samad, thank you for the question. What I'd say is that you're absolutely right. So our Now Assist have -- already had a consumptive piece to it, right? You have seat-based. And then if you use more than what was anticipated, you would have to buy more tokens. Up till now, that extra token monetization has not been significant. What we're talking about now is very similar in that the agentic capabilities that we're bringing out now, we are not -- we're not making a new SKU. It's going to be in the Now Assist. So those 1,000 customers that have already bought it have it automatically. They get to use it. But once they start using the agentic for the assist, that's going to run the meter a lot faster. And so the expectation is that, again, the baseline subscription is required and necessary, but the monetization of the hockey stick of when those agents really get deployed and are really driving value is when you're going to see that hockey stick of growth. So not very different than what we've been doing before. It's just now being applied to agentic AI as well as the core Now Assist. Does that make sense? Samad Samana : Yes. Thank you so\u2026 Gina Mastantuono : And then Amit is going to add something. Amit Zavery : Yeah. I think with agentic, as I was mentioning earlier, Samad, the amount of tokens you require for a lot of these tasks \u2013 because you\u2019re breaking the particular intent of the user into multiple pieces of the task and each of this requires a lot of work in the back end, that\u2019s where this amount of assist you require just keeps on going up very, very fast. And this is where this idea that today, your subscription will have some amount of it, and they keep on adding to it as they use more of it. So it makes it very easy for our sellers to go and talk about this thing. Customers can start using. We have 1,000 plus customers already using it. So it becomes a very easy, scalable and win-win for both us and the customer. Gina Mastantuono : Thanks, Samad. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Michael Cikos : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to cycle back. I know in the press release and the prepared comments, you had cited this go-to-market optimization. Can you just provide a little bit more color on that front as far as what ServiceNow has in store? And I think, Gina, to the top of the Q&A with Kash's question on impact from consumption or federal, but do the go-to-market optimizations in any way play a role in your guidance philosophy here as well? William McDermott : Yeah. I think it's very important that you understand that we are building strength on strength. We still have everything just as it was in the fundamental business model of ServiceNow : the subscription-based pricing, the focus on industry-specific solutions, packaged and targeted for personas across an enterprise, on the best platform in the business. That's where we are the control tower for AI transformation. In addition, we have brought about RaptorDB, which is an incredible database, based on PostgreSQL, open-source standards. We acquired a company called Swarm64. We got the best database watchmakers in the world to put some secret sauce into making that a ServiceNow sensation. On top of that, we have the connectors into all the other major data sources in the world from the hyperscalers to Oracle all the way through to Snowflake and Databricks where we'll be able to use that data and the automation of work. That is yet a net new business for ServiceNow. It also happens to be a $250 billion TAM, and we're in the early innings, but we love what we're seeing. And on top of all this, we have this beautiful platform that has been enabled with what we call Now Assist, which is our agentic AI portfolio. So when you, as a customer, procure our Pro Plus version of the platform that you've grown to love, you now are going to get these agentic AI agents with that platform. We will also give you some ability to look at thousands of different things you can do with it. That's included in that subscription price. But as you do more and more with it and more and more with our agentic AI agents, a meter kicks in, and we make more money on top of the core. And the customer gets tremendous return on their investment because now instead of people doing all this stuff, they have their agents working for them, and they wouldn't do it if it wasn't a great business case anyway. And the consumption is smart because if you're using it, you're doing it and you're getting value from it. So now we're all on the same value page. So that's that. So we still are going to market with Paul Smith, who runs our global field. He also became a President. Congratulations to Paul. And we have a gentleman that is named Paul Fipps that is running the regions to give more bandwidth to the executional excellence of running the number every quarter even as we build out new dreams in harmony with Amit and Paul to invent the $30 billion version of ServiceNow. And so what I'm really super happy about is we're not just focused on big enterprises. We have a great commercial business. And we also have a great direct-to-consumer business that we're building out because we're very happy with $50,000, $150,000, $200,000 deals on top of these $100 million. And we want both high value and high volume. And when we put this all together, you're dealing with a company that's performing at the Rule of 54. You're dealing with a company that's blown through $10 billion, on its way to $15 billion plus by 2026, that has a bold ambition for $30 billion plus going forward and I would say a great management team. And that's all part of the go-to-market incidentally because no grass has grown underneath our feet. We're not measured by how many e-mails we got done in the office. We can do them in the back of a car on our way to a customer meeting. So we brought in the best engineers -- engineer and the great leadership of Amit and who incidentally is also our Chief Operating Officer in addition to being the President and the lead of all of our engineering efforts. And he is an expert in product packaging and pricing. So that interplay with our innovation and go-to-market has never been sharper than it is right now. So that's kind of an outline of what's going on, and we're putting agentic AI to work in all these processes. I'll give you an example. We just did a sales kickoff meeting in Vegas. We had about 8,000 of our closest friends there. And we showed them how AI is going to do their territory management for them. So they'll take all the use cases, all the data that exists already, and they'll compile their road map of first things first with their customer relationships all the way down to here's the solution, he is the best-in-class offering and he is the customer you need to take it to. That's cutting out so much of the busy work that the sales professionals are super excited. And that's true of all position types in the company. Does that help you? Michael Cikos : It does. It does, Bill. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. William McDermott : My pleasure, Mike. Thank you. Gina Mastantuono : And Mike, just from the -- your specific question on guidance philosophy, of course, everything we're talking about is factored into our guidance. Top to bottom, east to west and north to south, all of these impacts and thoughts are very thoughtfully put into our guide. So very specific answer to that question for you. Michael Cikos : Excellent. Thanks for closing the loop there, Gina. Thank you. William McDermott : Absolutely, Mike. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. The final question comes from Derek Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Derek Wood : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess keeping on the same theme, Gina, I just want to unpack your comments around foregoing new subscription revenue for basically incremental consumption of agents, but it will take time to build up on the consumption side. Is the message here that you expect some kind of near-term headwinds in seat growth as more workloads are being pushed to agents and that it just takes time to start really moving the needle on the consumption side? And if that's the case, just how long do you think this will take for this new hybrid pricing model to be net accretive versus kind of your previous Pro Plus sales motions? Gina Mastantuono : Yeah. So Derek, thanks for the question. Just very, very clearly, not foregoing new subscription revenue. At the end of the day, Now Assist continues to grow extremely well. We talked about 150% growth quarter-on-quarter, fastest new growing product launch of our history, and we absolutely expect that to continue to grow. The agentic AI hockey stick of value is going to take some time as customers start to use it. And so we're absolutely not foregoing. We're continuing to have strong subscription revenue growth, 20% constant currency at our scale at $12.675 billion. Never been seen before. And on top of that, you will get the hockey stick of agentic AI, multiple AI growth in as customers really start to get value in it. So it's an and, and not an or, and I want to make sure that that's clear outside the gate. William McDermott : And may I just say one thing, Derek, to build on what Gina said. And Amit covered this earlier, but I don't blame you for asking questions because one thing I want to make sure everybody understands, if we didn't have any consumption attribute to the pricing model, everything stayed the same. You still have to subscribe to the Now Assist portfolio, and that is the same subscription model we have today. The nuance here is we've actually added what I would call an accelerator to the consumption idea because my idea really is that they'll buy more subscription because they're actually getting the agents included in it. And then as they consume that subscription, and Amit very nicely said, they will quickly because they're going to get so much value from it, we actually then kick in an accelerator or a turbocharger to the existing business model. We still have the existing business model easily as it is. And someone asked a great question. It could be that knowing with the Now Assist portfolio and the speed of our innovation, they get the agents for the subscription. That might actually significantly increase the subscription. We just got to let it play out. But in any case, once they start consuming those agents and those processes are being done by the agents and those assists are happening at mass scale, from an investor standpoint, you're going to really like ServiceNow a lot more. Derek Wood : Okay. So yeah, it sounds like you're really building up a springboard that's net new that the hockey stick hopefully around the corner. That's clear. Thank you. William McDermott : Thank you, Derek. Gina Mastantuono : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
