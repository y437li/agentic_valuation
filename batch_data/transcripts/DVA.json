Baird Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Kim, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin sir. James Gustafson : Well, thank you Kim, and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations; and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Garry Menzel, our CFO; Craig Samitt, President of our HealthCare Partners Division; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, included in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent Thiry : Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for your interest in DaVita HealthCare Partners. Q1, disappointing financial performance in HealthCare Partners. Strong financial performance in Kidney Care. I will discuss this performance as well as we will update our outlook, but first as always, I will review our clinical outcomes. We continue to present our clinical outcomes first, because that is what comes first. We are first and foremost a caregiving company. On the Kidney Care side, we now serve approximately 165,000 dialysis patients in the United States, approximately 35%; and in this area, CMS recently released the quality incentive program payment results for 2014 payments. I remind everyone that the way they structure the quality incentive program is with penalties only, there is only downside, so that's why we will use the penalty word. They had established four clinical measures, central venous catheters, AV fistulas, URR, less than 65, and hemoglobin, less than 12. DaVita ranked number one in the industry in all four clinical measures, and if you look at the percent penalties in aggregate, only 1.6 of DaVita clinics had any penalty, compared to 6% of clinics for the rest of the industry. This performance is even more notable, especially when you adjust for socio-economic factors given we have more lower income people and people of color in our patient population in the overall nation. Nonetheless, we had a 59% lower rate of penalty centers versus the rest of the industry in four counties, and we improved our rural clinic performance year-over-year, while the rest of the industry saw rural clinic performance decline. Moving on to HealthCare Partners and clinical metrics in that area, one of the areas of focus is reducing hospital readmissions in the second half of 2013, looking at California and Nevada, we had a 14% readmission rate, that is 24% below the national benchmark of 18.4%. This alone means our patients avoided more than 700 readmissions over the last six months, relative to the rest of the nation. For these and other clinical outcomes, for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners, we compare very favorably to national averages, and our superior clinical results in healthier patients and lower taxpayer costs. Now, moving on to operating performance, where I will jump right into discussing HealthCare Partners. I will discuss both Q1 and the lower guidance for the year. Q1 was amiss, it was a big miss and it was another in the series of misses. This is embarrassing for us, and no doubt, worrisome for you. So legitimate and expected question is, what is going on? And the explanation for the quarter and the year are pretty much the same. So I will discuss most of it in the context of the year. Number one, the primary driver of this shortfall, is the fact that in the first phase of the DaVita HealthCare Partner's combination, there was a small group of new market, new business deals done, which have substantially underperformed plan. The deals fell into a few different categories, including acquisitions and assuming some risk contracts. In aggregate, these deals explain about half of the $50 million reduction in the midpoint of our guidance. Within this category, the largest was Albuquerque, and on this front, the new and incremental bad news, is that the health plan acquisition of the Lovelace plan by Blue Cross, Blue Shield has not yet been approved by the government, which means our globally capitated arrangement does not fully kick in, which creates incremental losses each month, and also makes the post approval, if we assume approval recovery, incrementally tougher as well. Separate factor for the $50 million, we misestimated the average MA rate we will receive by 0.8%, eight-tenths of a percent on our patients across our geographies, which equals $16 million for the year, $4 million per quarter. Next, the third and final contributor to the decreased guidance, but it does not constitute underperformance, is that we have incorporated this expectation of $10 million in startup losses in our new Tandigm joint venture, with independents Blue Cross and Philadelphia. This was explicitly excluded from our guidance last quarter. So while we corporate it, means that we go down in under $10 million in guidance, it does not constitute any underperformance versus prior comments. There is a potential offsetting upside to the scenario we just laid out. We had a contractual contingency in one of our new markets, that could very well lead to recognizing another $30 million to $45 million in revenue this year, of which $10 million to $24 million would be attributed to 2014 performance and activities, and the balance to 2013. Now the next question you might well ask, how can you possibly expect us to feel comfortable going forward, given the magnitude of this change? And the answer is, we probably can't make you feel comfortable, until we start doing what we said we would do. But we can tell you, that the team that did those deals, was displaced many months ago. The next question might well be, when will the new markets get better? Assuming no contingency payout this year for us, we would be disappointed, very disappointed if they did not do better in 2015. Next question, how much better should we expect them to do? And on that front, we are not comfortable estimating at this point. We fear it would be too unreliable. The next question is, while separate from the economic underperformance of this portfolio of early deals, how should we think about what that says for our overall value proposition? And here the good news is, that in each of these situations, we are adding the clinical value we are supposed to add. We are getting good physician leadership momentum, as we are supposed to and we are advancing the integrated care capability of our partners and affiliate physicians, as we are supposed to. So we are fulfilling the fundamental value proposition in these situations, despite the underperforming economics. Next question might well be, as you stare at the numbers and reflect on this explanation, would be, given the explanation of the shortfall, it seems to apply that the three big legacy foundational markets, California, Nevada and Florida, are performing solidly. And the good news is, that answer is an unambiguous, yes. If you were to strip out, what we might call legacy ACP from the four deal portfolio, they generated approximately $76 million NOI and $116 million in EBITDA after allocating all corporate overhead, and a couple of minor non-recurring item adjustments, and those numbers, as you well realize, would put us right on schedule. Next question, what does the series of events do to your confidence, my confidence, our confidence, and the team and the business? And our answer has a few parts. That the new team, the new HealthCare Partners leadership team, does deals with traditional DaVita discipline. Having said that, we are doing new things, and there will be an experience curve. And as to the broader question, a broader question about the industry, our views have not changed, and greater care and population health management will grow. We are good at doing that with physicians in the lead. Thank you. I look forward to your questions, and now on to LeAnne Zumwalt with an update on policy issues. LeAnne Zumwalt : Thanks Kent. I will cover two topics. One, the recent ESRD legislation, and two, the 2015 Medicare Advantage rate notice. So first, as part of the reason, physician SGR legislation, Congress partially addressed dialysis, reimbursement underfunding. The key legislative highlights are, as in the 2014 ESRD rule, the 2015 rate would be essentially flat with 2014. The good news, is that the remaining dialysis cuts were reduced and stretched over three years. In 2016 and 2017, our bundled payment rate will be updated by market basket minus 1.25%, and in 2018, market basket minus 1. The bundling of additional oral drugs is delayed until 2024. This is positive outcome, as there was substantial risk that CMS significantly underfunded these drugs in 2016, resulting in a de facto rate cut. Overall, this is a good victory for the care community, as these changes were scored by the congressional budget office, of putting about $2.2 billion back into the dialysis payment system. Having said that, we still on average, lose money on our Medicare patients. The absence of full market basket increases over the next few years, the Medicare reimbursement will be further below our cost of providing care. As a result, we will expand only in geographies where there is a healthy subsidy from the private sector. And geographies without the private support will remain flat, or be a contraction of service, as we will be forced to close some centers. Second, in April, CMS announced the final Medicare Advantage benchmark rates for 2015. Based on the final roll, we expect 2015 rates to be roughly flat for us, compared to 2014. We and others benefit from the rollbacks in the planned risk recalibration in 2015. Although this presents uncertainty in 2016 and beyond, as CMS moves forward with the new model. Going back, the risk recalibration is good for beneficiaries, as it will help prevent more dramatic benefit changes in 2015, moving to the new model could create adverse selection or encourage payors to take steps to avoid serving higher cost patients, whose health needs are the greatest. Its encouraging that CMS ought to protect MA benefits and acknowledge the clinical improvements that Medicare Advantage Program is making. Saying, and I quote, enrollees are benefiting from greater quality. Over half of enrollees now in plans with four or more stars, a significant increase from 37% of enrollees in such plans in 2013. Note that in HCP, we have over 80% of our patients in plan, that are four star rated and above for 2015, well above national averages. I will now turn the call to Garry. Garry Menzel : Thanks LeAnne. I will walk through a few more details on the numbers. First, some additional comments on our Kidney Care operating metrics. Kidney Care adjusted operating income of $387 million was up $1 million from the prior quarter. Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 5%, when normalized for days of the week. Dialysis segment profitability was down $21 million sequentially, due to two negative factors, offset by three positive factors. The two negative factors were; one, three fewer treatment days in the quarter; and two, an increase in patient care costs of $4.42 per treatment, which was due primarily to an increase in EPO unit cost in the quarter, and seasonally higher fixed and central level expenses per treatment, because of the fewer treatment days in the quarter. These were largely offset by three positive factors; a 2% increase in treatments per day, as a result of strong non-acquired growth. Two, a $0.77 increase in dialysis revenue per treatment; and three, a $4.19 decrease in dialysis segment G&A, $1.50 of which is due to impairments that were recorded in the fourth quarter, and the remainder is a combination of tighter G&A controls, and normal quarterly fluctuations. During the quarter, we lost $6 million in our international operations, in line with our prior international outlook of $25 million of losses. However, at the time, this specifically included any costs for our Saudi Arabia expansion. As our planned ramp up in Saudi Arabia will create $15 million in additional operating losses in 2014, we now expect to lose $40 million internationally, which is included in our increased Kidney Care guidance. Kent has already discussed in detail the performance of HealthCare Partners, so I will next review some key metrics for the overall enterprise. First, our debt expense was $106 million in the first quarter. Second, the effective tax rate was 40.5% in the quarter, in line with our expected range of 40% to 41% for full year 2014. Third, we continue to generate strong cash flows, as operating cash flow was $419 million in the first quarter. We still expect operating cash flow to be between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion in 2014, excluding any payments associated with the potential settlement of physician relationship investigations. Finally, we have updated our 2014 operating income guidance. Our updated enterprise operating income guidance is $1.725 billion to $1.84 billion. This includes one, reduced HCP guidance of $205 million to $260 million. Two, increased Kidney Care guidance of $1.52 billion to $1.58 billion. Note that this Kidney Care guidance includes $15 million in 2014 losses to ramp up operations in Saudi Arabia, which were not included in the prior guidance. So combined with the $10 million for Tandigm, that means we are including $25 million in expenses previously excluded. Therefore, on apples-to-apples basis, the bottom of our consolidated guidance range is up $25 million and the top is up $5 million. I will now hand the call back to KT. Kent Thiry : Thank you, Garry. I'd like to add one editorial comment on the policy front. The ESRD Kidney Care victory was a big one, and once again, we led the community to a thoughtful strategy and through formidable campaign. I'd like to step back for a moment, and just think about our two primary businesses, Kidney Care and our Medical Group, and think about each of them across four parameters, as we look out over the next two to three years. Rate minus expense times volume and then factored by execution risk. On the Kidney Care side, rate, there is more downside than upside. Although, we do have somewhat of a reimbursement safety net, as the government cannot afford to have many centers closed. On the expense side, things look relatively stable, compared to historical norms. On the volume side, things look relatively stable, probably a bit slower than the rate we have enjoyed the last few years. With respect to execution and reliability, Kidney Care looks pretty solid. On to HealthCare Partners, our medical group. As to rate, there is more downside than upside. As to expense, there is probably more downside than upside, but hopefully, we can make those words not true. As to growth, unit growth looks very promising, and as to execution, reliability, the legacy markets look solid, the new markets look poor. Now if you step back to look at the aggregate enterprise for a moment, we still think it is a differentially solid platform for the long term. A strategic position is good. The market positions are strong. The talent trajectory is good, and our capital structure and our capital efficiency and our cash flows are all solid. Thank you, and let's move on to Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Justin Lake with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Thanks. Good evening. First question, you mentioned the operating income for HCP, and you gave us a number of metrics that basically allowed you back into these recently acquired practices are losing about $80 million for the year in your guidance. Can you tell us what the plan is for turning this around, Kent, and how much we can expect to improve for 2015? Kent Thiry : Justin, could you repeat the numbers you threw out please? Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Sure. You said the legacy business is running $76 million, the reported numbers for HCP are $54 million positive. [Indiscernible] back into these newly acquired centers, running about $20 million a quarter of losses? Or $80 million for the year. So obviously a very big number in terms of losses there. I am curious, what you are doing to turn that around, and how quickly you think you could turn around? Kent Thiry : Yeah. First, without getting into a lot of complexity, you can't just subtract the two and take the difference, and then attribute all of that to new markets, because there is some other stuff going on, like the MA rate predictions, etcetera. There are some issues that cut across the two categories. Its not quite as clean as that. And in addition, some of those losses were absolutely planned and intentional, part of establishing ourselves in new markets. But separate from fine tuning the actual number, what we are going to do, to make it better, is going to sound pretty vanilla on our call. We are working on the rate side, the expense side and the unit side. But the biggest single swing factor, is having the transaction in New Mexico be approved by the government. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Can you give us a number on the swing factor for that? Kent Thiry : I don't think that would be in your best interest, Justin. So I think we will have to hold back from that. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Okay. And then, on HCP again. Last quarter you mentioned you're working with plans to try to get the contract structures that were a little more reasonable, in terms of times, when there was pressure on reimbursement. We are just curious if you can give us an update on how those negotiations are going, and whether you're feeling more comfortable going into 2015, than you did in 2014? Kent Thiry : Yeah, I would say, we made tiny bit of progress in the quarter, that's actually not disappointing, in the sense that a lot of contracts aren't appropriate to change, until they are up for renewal, and we don't necessarily want to precipitate an extensive renewal conversation with everyone at one time. So its not disappointing when I say tiny, nor is it impressive, its kind of a tweener. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Okay thanks. I will jump back in the queue. Kent Thiry : All right. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Good afternoon. Kent, just wanted to clarify again? You said the three big legacy foundational markets was doing -- was at $76 million of operating income, or was it $176 million? Kent Thiry : It was $76 million, its actually right in that $75 million to $76 million range, and the other number was $116 million in EBITDA after allocating all corporate overhead. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Then, can you give us a little bit more color on the potential upside? Is that all dependent upon the deal -- the Blue Cross deal in New Mexico going through, or is it something else that you're thinking about, that you don't know about yet? Kent Thiry : We can't disclose exactly where that contractual contingency sits, because of some confidentiality agreements. And so, all we can say is that, that contractual contingency exists within our new market portfolio, and there is a good chance, better than 50% chance that it will in fact be triggered. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Okay. But we don't have any idea on the timing? Kent Thiry : Since every prediction on the timing has been wrong so far, I think we will shy away from venturing into predicting again. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Fair enough. And then, as for the Medicare Advantage, obviously pretty positive news on that front. But just curious, how close are we to achieving parity between the [indiscernible] parity. Isn't that a year or two out? Kent Thiry : Most of our counties are in the two year or four year phase down periods. So 2015 will be the final year for our counties and the four year. We do not have any membership of significance in the six year, based on [ph] counties. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Okay. So 2015 really is the last year. Okay, great. Then last one on HCP, looking at the decline in operating -- the ratio of operating income to care dollars, have gone from 10% a year ago to 5%. What's your long term objective, where could this go and what's going to get us there? Kent Thiry : Kevin, say the question one more time please? Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : The ratio of operating income to care dollars under management this quarter came in at 5%. A year ago, it was 10.4%. is that just contingent upon improving operations, and one out of HCP, I guess I am trying to get some idea as to what a normalized ratio should be? Kent Thiry : I think I am hesitating, because there is a bunch of variables that could push it one way or another. For example, we will probably be doing more joint ventures with payers, and that may very well b e low margin business, because we are splitting the equity and the upside. But on the other hand, it could be incredibly capital efficient, and in the long run, as we have talked about for 15 years, its cash on cash, return on capital, that ultimately determines a company's long term future. And so in some cases, we may be actively seeking, what looks like low margin business, but is incredibly attractive in terms of risk adjusted return on capital. And then, looking at it from a different perspective, we will also still be doing some of the good old traditional global care business, where we and our physician leaders take the entire bolus of it and manage it with ever increasing capability. So how those different factors are going to net out, combine with just in general, increase competition in the space, is pretty hard to predict. So I think -- what we will have to get good at doing, is just parsing out these different variables. So you can see, where any movements in margin are good news, bad news, or neutral news. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Kent Thiry : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Zimmermann with Goldman Sachs. Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs : Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us some updated thoughts in potential closing of centers. The CMS rate is going to improve and just curious if you're still planning on going ahead on closing centers? Kent Thiry : Unfortunately the answer is yes, and we are probably going to be closing in the neighborhood of 20 in the near to intermediate term, as much as it breaks our heart, when the government cuts our reimbursement, and holding it flat constitutes a cut, given there are certain cost pressures we face, that we simply can't get down to zero. That in some geographies, where there are not enough private patients to subsidize the federal government, we and other people are going to have to close down some centers. We will do so with incredible care and respect and oversight, in order to take care of our patients and our teammates. But in the end, we are caring a lot of money losing centers, and we can't continue to carry that many, if in exchange, our rates get cut. Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then on the patient care cost side, I understand that they went up per treatment, but you did a pretty good job containing costs from the G&A side. Can you give us a bit more detail on what those G&A cost controls were, and do you see additional opportunities in the next couple of quarters? Kent Thiry : I do not think we are going to see a continuation of tremendous accomplishment, so that's where -- that we pulled off over the last year. We started thinking about it and planning for it, a full two, two and a half years ago, when we expected the government to be squeezing reimbursement, and so it was done with a lot of foresight, with a lot of warning and planning, and so it is not to disrupt people's lives nor our company's operations, and of course most importantly, our patient care. Having said all that, there's limits to how much can be done there, and so, I think you are looking at, pretty much the end of that run of progress. Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then my last question is on capital deployment. You're sitting here with $1.1 billion on the balance sheet. Can you give us an update on thoughts towards acquisitions or potential repurchases? Kent Thiry : Well, we are hoping, although it sounds funny to use that word, that we will be taking a big chunk of that cash to execute on our settlement with the federal government, and that would be about $390 million or so, and at our new size, we certainly want to keep -- certainly want cash on hand. Having said that, we don't need to have $1 billion in our wallet, and we will go through our normal exercise, consistent with how we thought the last 15 years, in comparing at that time, our business opportunities, our repurchase opportunities and our debt reduction opportunities. And so right now, we don't have a position on that, and of course, we welcome any input from all of you, which you would prefer. Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Thanks a lot. Kent Thiry : Thank you, Brian. Operator : And your next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Thanks. Hi everybody. So wanted to just may be ask a little bit more about some of the deals that you're referring to, and if I guess if you could may be help us think through where you think you miscalculated the most, in terms of entering these new markets and the types of structure you had, its clear in Albuquerque, you miscalculated with regard to the payor landscape and the ability to forge a better relationship there with Lovelace, hopefully that changes. But, can you maybe help us think through how else you have miscalculated, and how this strategy may be pivoting, so that you can avoid that? Kent Thiry : Darren, it\u2019s a right question. But the correct answer to it, is that the team that did those deals, was not thoughtful. It did not do the right kind of rigorous analysis, reflection. Did not weight the relative merits of partnership versus fighting, and in particular, in one instance, didn't correctly calibrate what had happened after fighting a battle in Albuquerque. Both Lovelace, the hospital and the plan, and us, both sides came out significant losers. The only ones who benefited, were our collective competition. The new team has since turned relationships around in that market, and we are readying employees to work collaboratively, with both Lovelace and the new plan. The way these things should work, assuming that we do get government approval on that transaction. So rather than go through what would sound like a relatively vanilla characterization of different types of mistakes, the root cause was the team that was working on it did not bring the right discipline and thoughtfulness, and those people are not doing deals with us anymore. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay. That's fair. I guess may be that turns me to the next most obvious question is, you just announced a fairly significant transaction, this Tandigm joint venture. So may be just, given that there is a new more thoughtful team, I guess, that put that one together, give us some background on how that deal came about, what the model looks like, and may be talk a little bit more about how that strategy will be different? Kent Thiry : Let me go ahead and take a quick stab, and then Dr. Samitt may want to add. But this is the type of arrangement we might end up doing in other places, and we certainly have a lot of major payors, who are talking to us about types of arrangements like this. IBC is the leading payor in that market, with a very strong market position, and a good reputation, as a citizen in the healthcare community. So we like that type of partner. The way we structured it, is the new venture is incented to succeed. So neither parent company, so to speak, can get in the way, because of any other considerations. The new management team and the Board of Directors are incented structurally to deliver success for patients, physicians and shareholders through that venture; and that's the only way to attract the kind of challenge you need to tackle the challenge, in a market that does not have any significant integrated care penetration. Lastly I would say, the way its structured, although it will not lead to any quick profit drop-through is very capital efficient; because we are not having to make any large acquisitions, and because of the way the economics are structured, the upfront operating losses are quite modest, in particular, quite modest, relative to the long term market opportunity. Craig is there anything you'd like to add? Craig Samitt : Sure KT. Just four additional points. The first is that the IBC-Tandigm transaction allowed us to review lessons learned from the prior deals that KT described in the past, and focus on avoiding risks, that we were faced with some of the other deals from prior to 2014. The second is, as you can see, this is our new pilot in forging a team of equals relationship between a payor and a renowned delivery system. And so, we are optimistic that the shoulder-to-shoulder partnership will be highly effective. In terms of structure, we are through Tandigm, enabling primary care physicians, with supports from both the payor side, which is very data and analytics rich, and healthcare partners, which is clinical care model and population health rich, in managing the transition of Philadelphia marketplace from volume to value. And fourth, is the reason why this is a prime market for us is that, Philadelphia is one of the highest cost of care marketplaces in the U.S., with in fact the highest admission rate per thousand in the country. So our expertise is very much needed in that market. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Makes sense. My last question just about Tandigm. What is your enrolment target, if we think about this couple of years down the road, how many lives do you think you will have in that arrangement? Kent Thiry : It\u2019s a fair question, but there is just too much uncertainty at this point. So giving you a number would be tantamount to just guessing -- if we succeed, the number could be significant. But succeeding is not going to be easy. There are reasons why markets have high admit rates, and part of our challenge is to establish a collaborative constructive relationship with the leading hospitals, in order to collectively bring quality improvements and appropriate savings to the table, shared by everyone. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : Thanks for taking the question. I guess going back to Albuquerque; specifically, it would appear that there was a meaningful decrease in performance sequentially. Can you give us any more details around what was worse than you had originally expected, just over the last quarter or so? Kent Thiry : I think Gary, we don't want to go into any more micro detail on individual market. So if you could just allow us to stick with having disclosed much more than we typically do already in individual market, because we felt we needed to, in order to answer the legitimate questions. But I think we best leave it at that. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : Okay. I guess may be then, a little bit bigger picture on the underperforming deals. Can you may be discuss, how much risk you feel is still there? Is there still some meaningful downside of things don't get better or on the same technology, or do you feel like it sort of bottoms out? Kent Thiry : I would say, we are much closer to bottoming out, and so the ratio of upside to downside is attractive, a breath of fresh air, in an otherwise stuffy room. So that's good news, I would say. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : Okay. And then do you have any concern that the Blue Cross deal does not close in Albuquerque, or is it just typical stuff that's maybe going to take longer? Kent Thiry : We don't have any insight really. The Department of Justice keeps those things close to the vest certainly, and periodical evidence would suggest, that the deal will get approved. But you never know for sure, and particular, if in the government's mind, Blue Cross Blue Shield is unwilling to agree to reasonable conditions, then all bets are off. So we don't know enough to handicap other than these things typically, as you know, get closed. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : Okay. And then, does any of this change the guidance you had given on the acquisition pace at HCP, which I think was sort of two this year, more next year, and then a lot the year after? Kent Thiry : I would say at this point, we are not changing anything. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : Okay. May be one question on the international comments that were made, the losses, I think Garry, you said were $40 million, and that changed. What was it before? Garry Menzel : $25 million. Sorry Gary. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : That's very helpful. And may be last question on dialysis, what did you guys think of the revised parameters around the accountable care demo with the ESCOs? Kent Thiry : Before I answer that Gary, let me go back and tweak my response to your question about the expected pipeline of significant deals in HealthCare Partners. I think we probably should dial back that expectation a bit, because we need to prove quickly, that we can reliably deliver on what we say we are going to do, before we should run around deploying any more of your capital. So probably, we pull that back a bit, and can't quantify right now, but at least directionally, I think you should think about it that way. On the ESCOs, we know that we are incredibly passionate and bullish on our capability, to dramatically improve quality and substantially reduce costs and deliver incredible patient experiences in an integrated care, globally capitated or anything like it world for Kidney Care, and we have proven it. And we have proven it at significant scale with breadth and depth, and so we so much want to bring that value to America, and in so doing, forcing others to invest and get better and better at the same time. And we are very grateful that CMS has put so much time into trying to figure out a way to introduce a vehicle for making all that come true. Having said that, and being very appreciative of some of the changes they make, we were disappointed in what they came out with, and I think I will just stop there. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : Would you say they are headed in the right direction and just need some minor tweaks, or is it still significantly off-base for what you would need to really ramp up your involvement? Kent Thiry : We think there is just a couple very reasonable changes that would open up the gates to a beautiful pilot. So we think its very doable and very reasonable. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : You can't share any of those specifics with us? Kent Thiry : I don't think that would be good to get into on a big public forum. We are sharing our thoughts with them, and we are incredibly grateful that they are listening. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gurda with KeyBanc. Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thank you. Kent, if we think about a deal that actually works out as it expected to, how should we or how should we expect to see the multiyear impact on margins play out? Is it one to two years of initial losses, followed by ever increasing margins after that, or --? Kent Thiry : Yeah, it\u2019s a tough one to answer Jason, because in HealthCare Partners, every deal could be quite different, depending whether we are primarily partnering with a hospital or a physician group or a payor or all of the above, and whether or not they already have risk, or whether or not we are just starting a new risk contract. And so, unfortunately, given unlike dialysis, every deal could be quite different. You need to stare at our track record, in order to draw the right inferences and extrapolations. This is where we have made your life very difficult, by having a lousy track record of doing new things. And so, we recognize the torturous position that our performance has put you in, and we hope to make amends over the next couple of years. Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets : All right. Putting aside the Albuquerque decision. You will be facing more Medicare Advantage rate cuts in 2015, making additional expansion in investments. Should we expect operating income growth at HealthCare Partners next year? Kent Thiry : At this point, I think we ought to stay silent on 2015, until we get a little more time and experience under our belt. We are not comfortable saying, OI is going to go down. We are not comfortable saying its going to go up. We are not comfortable sayings its going to be flat. We need a few more months under our belt, before we can give you a value added estimate. Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. My last question would be, I think you have warned in the past, that the exchanges offer more downside than upside, I think that's the way you put it. Is there any early read on your relationships with the payors on the exchanges that, any takeaways from the first quarter? Kent Thiry : Although its very preliminary, because as you understand, there is a lot of lag time, in finding out exactly who is going to exchange, and what exchange is going to pay and all that kind of stuff. So with a big caveat, on the fact that it is preliminary, the early results are positive, in the sense that we thought it was going to be quite bad, and so far, it is not. Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thank you. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. I guess a few questions on HCP. You mentioned that -- I think you said half of the issue was related to deals in new markets, and you mentioned contracts, what was that comment related to? What was the other issue there? Kent Thiry : There are three drivers of the shortfall Kevin. Half was the new market, new business acquisition portfolio. The second was the Tandigm $10 million previously excluded, so doesn't represent underperformance. The third component was a mistake, we were 0.8% off in forecasting our actual MA rates across the markets, and that 0.8% equals $4 million a quarter, $16 million on a year, right off the bottom line. Its of course embarrassing for us to make a mistake like that, but we did. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess though, in that source bucket we see -- you said the deals fell into buckets of new acquisition and then taking on new risk contracts. I just want to understand what you meant when you meant risk contracts, as opposed to deals being new market entrants? Kent Thiry : Got it. I am sorry Kevin, I understand the question now. There is one example where we just took over a network for a payor, it was an unsuccessful MA network that they have been running by themselves and with some others unsuccessfully and we took it over from them, with no exchange of capital involved. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So you've basically assumed a new risk contract? Kent Thiry : Correct. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is it a new market or an existing market? Kent Thiry : This was a new market, and while we expected losses, because we knew what their current economics were, and some of that we were cushioned from, and then some not. The problem is, the actual losses have exceeded the expected losses in the assumption of that contract. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess broadly, because that sounds hard to sell, I guess sometimes, maybe they are hard to differentiate. But when you look at HCP, would you say that it is more a cost issue or more a contract issue; because it feels like one might be easier to solve in a short period of time than others? I just wanted to get your thoughts around that. Kent Thiry : Our primary problems there have been from unthoughtful contracting non-thorough due diligence and one very bad business decision. Not our ability to drive integrated care, not our ability to work with physicians in the community to drive quality improvements, and savings and utilization etcetera. The news on those scores is positive, and so I think your diagnosis is correct. The stuff that was done wrong is easily fixed and we think we are there. Now also I want to add, again, we are doing new stuff and different stuff, so there will still be an experience curve, and there will still be a [indiscernible] issue. But we already are way, way, way better on the dimensions that cause us the problems a year, year and a half ago today. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I guess, I understand the shortfall this year makes you reticent to kind of make predictions about next year. But I think at the Analyst Day, you were kind of thinking that, you could be flat year-over-year in HCP, depending on how the final rate came in with the risk adjusters. It feels to me like the final rate for 2015 was better than one might have thought at the time. This years numbers are lower, it sounds like you feel like you understand to some degree that there is a contracting opportunity into next year, and yet you're not comfortable to say that you will be better next year versus this year. When you think about the swing factors, if its not your ability to manage costs, and that feels like its in control of the next year, what are the factors that you could understand going into next year? Generally where the rates are, generally what the contracting issues are that would stop you from growing next year? Kent Thiry : Yeah, its very good logic Kevin as usual, and I think the honest answer is just that, if you're sitting in these chairs, having been wrong now a few times, we simply don't want to represent, until we have done a lot more work, analytical work on every aspect of the business, before we start talking about stuff that's a year or two out. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, then I guess just last question. California Duals, do you have a sense there of how you will be participating in there, what the revenue opportunity might be for you? Craig Samitt : Yeah Kevin, this is Craig Samitt. We are in active discussions with multiple payors, who will be participating in the California Duals program. We hope to be able to participate in the program, but don't know yet if we will, with which payors or for how many patients we will be providing care for. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. Kent Thiry : Thanks Kevin. Operator : And your next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Couple of things I guess to start, Kent. Is there some sense that the window of opportunity for transactions is tightening on you, given both the lag between when you have been able to announce large transactions, and that's perhaps what's being manifest in the need to move towards more partnerships than [indiscernible] acquisitions? Kent Thiry : Let me take a stab and see if I get it right. There aren't very many mature proven MA risk management NDs that are around and independent anymore. So there is not a lot of eight point bucks out in the forest. And the good news is, those that are out there, are differentially interested in us, because of our legacy and our reality of physician leadership. So that's the bad news and good news on that side. But we do these other partnerships, not have a sense of need or not because of some notion that they are second best. We actually think that they can be absolutely as good and effective, as the conventional acquisitions. And in fact, the deal in Philadelphia is starting off with a very collaborative partnership with a leading physician IPA in the market. Its not just a payor DaVita partnership. The leading doctors who want to bring the improved quality and savings that comes from integrated care are very much onboard with the effort. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Okay. And then, looking at that Pennsylvania opportunity is kind of your first big foray in the northeast. Are there other obvious markets in that region that makes sense for you all, assuming that you're able to prove out the kind of the performance with this one? Kent Thiry : Yes. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Excellent. And then I guess the only other question is, on the international dialysis side. The Saudi Arabian contracts, and you have given us some good details on the startup there. How quickly can that be a material contributor? Is this really going to be a multiple year process to bring that to something that moves the needle for the dialysis franchise internationally? Thanks. Kent Thiry : Its going to be a couple years, just because there is so many centers involved and so many patients, that will be in a constant state of having a bunch of young immature centers, where we have got operating costs but not many patients, or zero patients as we build them, and then just the classic issues of having overhead, that's disproportionate to the revenue, and tell you have enough centers up and running. So its going to be a couple of years. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Thank you. Kent Thiry : We will of course work very hard to provide analysis that allows you to gauge our progress, and not just force you to sit back and wait for years until the portfolio matures. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citi. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Hi, good afternoon. A few questions; one, I just wanted to follow-up on the California Duals -- maybe I am incorrect, but it was my understanding at LA County, the plans were enrolling to Dual eligibles already. So I would have thought, they would have had provider networks in place, but it doesn't sound like that's the case? Kent Thiry : That is correct. The first phase of enrollment has begun. Again we are in active discussions with multiple plans and do hope to be able to participate in the program. We are not enrolling to-date, at this point. Craig Samitt : And therefore the plans do have lives that they are accountable for, that they don't have organized networks for and people just keep on going to their existing provider, with whatever management the plan itself can overlay. But for them, its just highly imperfect, but pretty normal way to get something like this started. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: So there is no revenue, no operating loss -- income or loss expectations associated with this in the guidance or there is a little probability weighted something in there? Craig Samitt : Right now, the premise is that, there is nothing big that's going to go on good or bad with Duals, and if we cut a deal that we think is material, we will get back to you the moment it happens. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Got you. On the other and corporate drag on the growth Kidney Care operating income, which typically runs $22 million, $26 million a quarter was actually zero this quarter and the gross Kidney Care operating income was down. Was there a reclass or was there some unusual benefit this quarter? Kent Thiry : Would you just repeat the question please Gary, and then either Jim Hilger or Jim Gustafson can hopefully nail it for you. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: I am just looking, year-over-year, dialysis operating income a year ago, $408 million. You had $22 million of losses in other and corporate to take you through a net $386 million operating income. This quarter, the gross was $387 million, you had zero net other and corporate, to get a net $387 million. So its up $1 million year-over-year, but obviously the loss is from international ancillary and corporate were much lower than they typically are. So I didn't know if there was a reclass between those, or some unusual benefit in the other and corporate lines this quarter? Kent Thiry : Jim [ph], can someone give a good answer? James Hilger : The improvement is in DaVita RX and in international. Year-on-year the accounts are almost solved. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: And is that recurring? Kent Thiry : Why don't, Gary, you give us a minute, because it just sends too much tentativeness in the answers. So give us a couple of minutes and we will get back to you. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. So unrelated though, I mean, Kent, you characterized dialysis performance as strong. So the gross dialysis operating income was from $408 million a year ago, down to $387 million. How does that translate to strong -- Kent Thiry : Very fair, and by that standard it wasn't strong, relative to our guidance and our fears about what 2014 might look like. We actually feel -- on our side, we are feeling very-very good. But compared to the standard that you just set forth reasonably, you're right, you could then say it was just -- you could say whatever you want. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. Last question, and maybe I will reveal my ignorance here. You said treatment days, down three days year-over-year, and I calculate weekdays the same and Saturdays the same. So was that weather related or am I just not understanding how you calculate treatment days? James Gustafson : This is Jim Gustafson. That's sequential Gary from Q4 to Q1, not year-over-year. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. That makes sense. Okay, that's all I had. Kent Thiry : All right. Thank you. I will point out one, I think it was mentioned earlier in the call, but we did have a significant increase in some of our costs, including EPO, which is part of why you see the OI number on the dialysis side, that Gary you were talking about. Okay, operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. John Ransom - Raymond James : Hi. I just want to demonstrate my grasp of the obvious. The deal in Pennsylvania, just to think about expectations for that division. You're probably going to have to do five to 10 of those deals and its probably going to take a couple of years, before we start seeing some material EBITDA from that strategy, is that a fair way to think about it and is that a reasonable pipeline? Kent Thiry : Yes sir. John Ransom - Raymond James : Yes on both? Kent Thiry : Say again please? John Ransom - Raymond James : Yes to both questions? So you need 5% to 10% or its going to take a couple of years? Kent Thiry : Maybe better say both questions again, so I am not being -- I am not too cryptic. John Ransom - Raymond James : No I am saying, it looks like it would take a couple of years by your own reckoning, and then may be you have to do, five to seven deals like this and a couple of years before you start to see some material EBITDA to the enterprise, is that a fair way to think about it, and is this the new template going forward? Kent Thiry : Well, if we are successful, the Philadelphia joint venture could be of pretty serious size, just like healthcare partners in California and Florida and Nevada. And so, the numbers could be substantial, therefore, you don't have to do lots and lots of them, if you succeed and they grow at a nice steady pace. Having said that, we do want to do more than one. We do not think this will be the last time we use a model like this and in many other instances however, we will still be a majority owner. In this particular case, the payor had such a strong market position, and because of some other aspects of the agreement as well, 50-50 just seemed like the right thing to do. John Ransom - Raymond James : Now the other question, you have a fairly small percentage of their MA lives in total. What's the trigger to get more than what you have? Or is it -- are you in the short term, or you just kind of limit these 300 primary care doctors, or is there a trigger to expand this beyond, what I'd call kind of a [indiscernible] to a broader relationship with their other MA lives? Craig Samitt : John I am sorry, I missed the beginning of the question. Can you repeat that again? John Ransom - Raymond James : Sure. I am sorry. You have a fairly small percentage of their MA lives. I am talking about the Blue Cross plan. What's the trigger to get a bigger percentage? Are you limited in the short term, that is the 300 docs? Craig Samitt : We are beginning to venture with the 300 physicians. But the hope and expectation is that, we would expand the contracted network with Tandigm beyond the 300 physicians through this year and into next year as well. So our expectation is that, our membership of both MA and commercial will grow in this venture. John Ransom - Raymond James : But its not -- you have to wait a year or you can grow it during the year, and next year there is something like -- we are going to try this for a year and see how it goes, and then we will extend it. So you can grow this as it happens? Kent Thiry : There is no specific trigger, before we can expand this network. John Ransom - Raymond James : Okay. Thank you. Craig Samitt : But I will add you don't want to take too many lives, if they are being cared for by physicians who are not committed or positively interested in the new model. Okay, operator. Thank you. John Ransom - Raymond James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Lisa Clive with Sanford Bernstein. Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein : Hi. Just one question, going back to integrated care on the dialysis side. Your Village Health business has been going along for several years, and obviously with ESCO not quite exactly the way you want it. What should we think about for the outlook of integrated care on your non-Medicare fee-for-service patients? Kent Thiry : The question is, what kind of growth can we expect on the Village Health side? Is there a reasonable care price? Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein : Yeah. And maybe not specific growth, but sort of what are your long term plans there? Is there a way to move into integrated care, without the ESCO program, or is there -- how are you thinking about that clearly? DaVita RX is a big platform for you, but what else should we think about as opportunities there? Kent Thiry : Village Health, we can grow it outside of the ESCO program. Not as cleanly and as aggressively as we could, if there was an attractive ESCO program. But yes, we can continue to nudge it along and push it along. In addition, one of Village Health's great benefits, is it adds value to our fee-for-service clients, who then can take that value into account, when we are negotiating dialysis rates. So just because we are not capitated or at risk with them, doesn't mean that they cannot appreciate the impact on quality in total costs, and how that reflected and monetized in part through conventional fee for service rates. But to the first part of your question, where we will continue to strive to grow Village Health everywhere, we can. It just won't be rapid without a government program that works. Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, great. And then maybe actually just one last question on the ESCO program itself. Under the current ESCO 2.0, it seems like the size is still pretty limited. Assuming you can get over your or you can reach an agreement with CMS on the few outstanding issues that you have, how many patients would you ideally like to enroll in this product program? Kent Thiry : Oh, if we like the program, we like to take the whole program to ourselves. I think they are putting a cap of 15,000 or 20,000 and of course, they would never allocate more than X percent to us, and we would take that in a second and double it if we could, if we just get a couple of changes. Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Thanks very much. Kent Thiry : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we do have one question that just queued up, Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird: Thanks for squeezing me in. You guys gave the OI for the legacy HCP markets, but can you also share the revenue and how margins would have compared versus the prior year? Kent Thiry : We can't do it spontaneously, and we will think about doing it for the next call, let us sort that out. We want to make sure there is reasonable boundaries on how much market specific stuff we talk about; because in general, its not in your best interest for us to go to deep market-by-market. We violated our normal policy, because we felt we had to do it in order to be responsible in discussing our current performance to you. But I am not at all sure we are going to want to go, where you're going. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird: No I can appreciate that. But I guess may be directionally, can you confirm that margins were higher this year versus the prior year? Anything to kind of point us in the right direction without divulging too much specific data? Kent Thiry : I think not, and let us just reflect after the call, and if I am making the wrong game time [ph] decision, Jim and Garry will correct it. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird: No, that's fair. Thanks a lot. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we show no further questions. Kent Thiry : All right. Thank you all very much. We will -- wait a minute, we have some breaking information. James Gustafson : Just wanted to respond to Gary's question. Gary the answer to your question is, we had better overall results in our ancillary businesses, which includes international. And the management -- the corporate charges were down, because we are allocating corporate costs among our various operated segments. And that is a change on the corporate charges. Kent Thiry : Okay. So hopefully Gary, that took care of that one, and our early answer we apologize was misleading. So I am glad we are able to correct it quickly, and thank you all very much for your interest in us. We will do our best to do what we said we were going to do going forward. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time.",

My name is Jenny, and I will be your conference coordinator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita HealthCare Partners Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference now. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, Jenny, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in the company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Garry Menzel, our CFO; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. First, I must apologize for the delay in our press release today. Our wire service messed up and didn't get it loaded in time. We'll make sure this does not happen in the future. Next, I'd like to move with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry: Okay, thanks, Jim, and greetings to everyone else. I've been out sick so far this week, so if there's some moments when I push the mute button, it's to save you from hearing a bunch of coughing, so please bear with me. First, our enterprise had another solid quarter, as you've seen in the press release. That consists of 2 parts : a strong quarter in Kidney Care with their OI of $402 million, and I'll let Garry cover most of those results; and then not a strong quarter in HealthCare Partners, and I'll take care of discussing that. But first, as always, we'll talk about our clinical outcomes, as that is what comes first. We are taking care of about 35% of the patients in dialysis centers in America. 98% of those are achieving a Kt/V of 1.2 or better, 73% have a fistula in place. In addition, there's many other complex clinical improvement programs, among them, for example, fluid management, where we've decreased by 15%, the number of patients with excessive fluid gain between treatments over the past 10 months, which for those of you that are clinically oriented, you realize it's a big deal. On the HCP front, we take care of nearly 830,000 patients on a comprehensive basis, and our 2013 HEDIS clinical metrics are pretty outstanding across-the-board in each of our legacy markets. Right now, we'll just focus briefly on California results and just talk about cancer screening and diabetes management, where we're either 4 or a 5-star across all of our Medicare Advantage MA patients, including 80% of our patients receiving colorectal cancer screenings that compares to a 2012 national average of 62%. And if you go back to our 2012 numbers, we were already at 80% back then, so the gap is a legitimate gap. In addition, 64% of our diabetic patients with cholesterol scores below 100 versus a 52% national average. And once again, our score back in 2012 from whence that national average comes was comparable back then to today, so it's a legitimate gap. So the clear message on both fronts is that our clinical outcomes are relatively outstanding, leading to healthier patients, higher patient satisfaction and, importantly, savings to taxpayers. But onto the HCP operating performance. You see the reported OI of $82 million. That overstates the performance for reasons I'll get to in a second. But within that number is very solid performance again in our 3 legacy markets, which generated $77 million in operating income and approximately $118 million in EBITDA, and this was, of course, to some extent, offset by our expenses in new markets, particularly New Mexico and Arizona. Trying to get right to the bottom line question, the overall, the recurring normalized OI is about $55 million. Now let me do some parsing to help you understand those aggregate numbers. The OI for the quarter benefited from the recognition of some net deferred revenues, approximately $20 million related to the maintenance of existing physician networks in some of our new markets, of which $6 million was related to the first quarter of 2014, and of the remaining $20 million, most of it primarily related to 2013. In other words, even though we knew it was likely, at the time, we couldn't realize these revenues at the time, but the first quarter of '14 was $6 million better than we could report at that time and 2013 was nearly $20 million better than what we could report at that time. There were also some non-period-specific items in the quarter. They effectively offset each other for a net of approximately 0. On the positive side was MA revenue. There was finalization of some of those rates and true-ups, which historically doesn't happen until Q3 and it happened in Q2. On the other hand, we had some negative increases to our medical loss reserves for prior periods and some error adjustments related to 2013. And again, the net of those puts and takes was about 0, leading to that normalized Q2 OI run rate of about $55 million. Our guidance already assumes lower margins in the second half, which mirrors historical trends because sicker patients with higher risk scores, some of them expire in the second half of the year and some younger and healthier patients age into MA, and so that's a natural annual trend. Some other good news is that in terms of MA patient growth year-over-year, in our 3 legacy markets, non-acquired MA patient growth of about 12% and non-acquired MA growth across all markets, 18%. So very nice, robust unit growth in the MA segment. One of the piece of good news is that it is highly likely that in New Mexico and Arizona, the 2 most economically significant new markets, their performance in '15 should be at least $25 million better in OI next year, maybe more so. Obviously, we can't lock and load that as a total certainty, but it's highly likely, at least $25 million better in '15 versus '14. And in both cases, we have a stronger team and a better strategic position than we had 6 to 9 months ago. On the organizational front, as many of you know, I'm stepping in to run HealthCare Partners for the foreseeable future, and I'll be spending a significant majority of my time there. It's been a difficult 18 months for all stakeholders and would be difficult for me to overstate how excited I am to step out under the field myself and lead that wonderful physician-led organization that puts a great value proposition of coordinated care on the table. And on that point of physician leadership, two of my key physician partners will be Dr. Tyler Jung, who was our recently named new Chief Medical Officer, who first joined HealthCare Partners in 1996 as a working hospitalist; and Dr. Chen Chuong [ph], our new Chief Clinical Officer, who's been with HealthCare Partners since 2002 and was the primary direct report to the previous Chief Medical Officer, so deep, deep experience on the physician side; as well as Dennis Kogod, who was, as you will recall, Chief Operating Officer on the Kidney Care side and now is picking up some pretty significant tenure as COO on the HCP side. People might ask questions about Kidney Care, but you see in the results that Javier Rodriguez and Mike Staffieri, currently the CEO and COO on the Kidney Care side, have a combined nearly 30 years\u2019 experience with DaVita Kidney Care and are well ready to carry on the momentum that currently exists since they were some of the primary creators of that momentum all along. So I'd just step back for a moment and look at the strategic position of our 3 businesses. On the U.S. Kidney Care side, we're well-positioned from a relative performance basis. There's consistent market growth, and we've consistently grown faster than the market. Our clinical outcomes are outstanding and getting better every year. At the same time, we've got to acknowledge the substantial environmental risk, especially on the reimbursement front. With respect to international, we are continuing to move towards establishing a solid foundation that could be a platform for years and years of risk-adjusted attractive profit growth for the enterprise. And as a minor anecdotal tidbit, we will open our first center in Saudi Arabia under our bid contract there within the next 8 weeks. On the HCP side, population health management, as just about everybody in the call knows, is a seemingly pervasive trend throughout America. And our value proposition is strong. Our foundation is strong. In the near term, we may have to weather some significant reimbursement headwinds. As you all know, we'll be stabilizing some of the new market performances. We're going to enhance our value proposition, including in legacy markets, and I look forward with a particular eagerness in working on that with the teams there. And then we start to grow. We've got a lot of growth opportunities. We've selected a handful, we'll probably select a handful more, and we look forward to having those mature in the years to come. Now Garry Menzel will walk through some more detail, particularly on Kidney Care. Garry E. Menzel: Thank you, Kent. First, additional comments on our Kidney Care operating metrics. Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 5% when normalized for days of the week. Dialysis segment profitability was up $21 million sequentially as a result of 2 factors : first, there were 1.5 more treatment days in the quarter; second, there was a seasonal decrease in payroll taxes from quarter 1 highs as our teammates hit annual caps. Our international losses were $9 million for the quarter. That is in line with our forecast to lose $40 million in 2014 as we ramp up our startup costs in Saudi Arabia in the second half of the year. Moving to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $106 million in the second quarter, excluding the $98 million in nonrecurring refinancing charges. As previously announced, we have refinanced our bank loans and much of our bond debt, reducing our effective interest rate and extending maturities. We expect quarterly debt expense to be approximately $100 million going forward. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 40.5% in the quarter, in line with our expected range of 40% to 41% for the full year 2014. Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $262 million in the second quarter and $1.77 billion over the last 12 months. Finally, I would like to address our outlook. Our updated enterprise operating income guidance is now $1.755 billion to $1.840 billion. This includes, number one, reducing the high end of our HCP guidance so that the range is now $205 million to $240 million. This includes the onetime Q2 revenue benefits that Kent discussed earlier. And number two, increasing Kidney Care guidance of $1.55 billion to $1.60 billion. We still expect operating cash flow to be between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion in 2014, excluding any payments associated with the potential PRI settlement with the government. As always, these guidance ranges capture a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mr. Justin Lake, JPMorgan. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First question, just, Kent, maybe you can give us some color as to what drove the decision-making on the leadership change at HCP. And then can you give us also some color on what your -- how much of your day-to-day time is going to be spent at HCP going forward versus what it was over the last 6 to 12 months? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the questions. On the second question, I'll be spending a significant majority of my time on HealthCare Partners. On the first question, as you know, historically, we don't typically comment on personnel issues. So I think I just stay away from that and reiterate how excited I am to step into that role after the last 18 months of some difficulty, as you know. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Sure. Maybe, Kent, the way -- better way to ask it is just if maybe you can lay out for us the 2 or 3 or 4 things that are on the top of your agenda to get accomplished as a change agent coming in there? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. I think it's the things that I mentioned. And they're going to sound relatively generic, but hopefully, they'll emerge in a very substantive and nongeneric way. But it is to deepen the value proposition in existing markets with respect to MLR management and patient loyalty, ability to attract and retain physicians, et cetera. So it's sort of power alley, fastball down the middle, improvements of the value proposition in legacy markets. It's to stabilize, continue to stabilize and improve things in the 2 new markets that have consumed the most economic resources, and it's to selectively grow. And as I mentioned, we've already identified a handful of very promised opportunities and are in various stages of execution on those and are picking from a bunch more for the next handful. So I think that's kind of the trilogy of focus. If that's helpful, I recognize it's quite generic at this point. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And last question, just on HCP again. One, you mentioned that you expect $25 million of improvement. I didn't catch what was driving that. And then secondly, in terms of the startup losses or the new market losses, can you give us a reasonable trajectory as to when you think you can get them back to breakeven? Kent J. Thiry: On the first question, Justin, I don't think we want to break out the $25 million because it's a couple different markets, it's a lot of different variables. I think the important news for shareholders is just that we're feeling good at, at least, a year-over-year $25 million pickup, which is a very significant amount, especially in 2 markets where we have a nontrivial market position to build from. And then as to exactly what their net economic statuses and when they hit it, I don't think we want to get into that level of detail. And in part, there are decisions in each place, and we may decide to have losses go on longer. Because of the returns we think we'll ultimately get, it's really too difficult to predict. So unfortunately, I got to stay away from that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank. Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Dana Nentin in for Darren. Just as it relates to HCP on the new market entry strategy, can you just discuss progress with Tandigm Health JV in Philly and then maybe update us on any similar types of relationships you have? Kent J. Thiry: Tandigm, the short answer is it's going well, but of course, that has to be qualified by the fact it's still in the early stage. We hit our target of 300 primary care physicians who signed up to work with Tandigm, which is exactly what we wanted. They are the physicians we were hoping would join. They are physicians that are committed to moving forward with IBC as a big payer and us in order to start to improve managed care in that community. And so without at all underestimating the business challenges to come, so far it's right on track. We've got the right partners, we've got the right tools, we've got the right momentum, but there's a lot of work ahead of us and time will tell. And then I guess, Dana, the other question is, might there be others? The short answer is yes. It's a model that attracted a lot of interest. We just have to decide how many we want to do at what pace. Now we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of our capabilities. Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, got it. And then continuing on HCP, can you just discuss medical cost trends in the quarter and whether your margin outlook has changed given the utilization environment? Kent J. Thiry: I don't think we have anything material to say on that. There hasn't been anything dramatic going on one way or another within the quarter. And so it's sort of business as usual, which is not to say it's a smooth line, but there's nothing noteworthy, I think, in the quarter itself. Operator : And next we have Mr. Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So I guess I just want to understand how the offsetting dynamics in the quarter that you mentioned in HCP works. You're saying that the Medicare rates you don't expect to happen in Q3 happened in Q2, so maybe it was net neutral to this quarter. But is it still net negative when you think about the yearly guidance? Kent J. Thiry: Well, certainly, it means that Q3 will be missing that incremental boost. It would have already happened, but that reality is incorporated into our total guidance for the year. And so it doesn't change our guidance, the fact that it moved from Q3 to Q2. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. Then just to understand the guidance then because you basically got $20 million of out-of-period revenue, but you kept the low end the same, you took the high end down by $20 million. So did you really take the low end down by $20 million and the high end down by $40 million on a 2014 kind of earnings space then? Kent J. Thiry: Could you repeat the question, please? Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Well, so your guidance for HCP, I believe, kept the low end of the range and reduced the high end by $20 million. But you're saying you got $20 million out-of-period revenue and, theoretically, operating income. So if you're just trying to focus on what you actually earned in 2014, did you essentially take the low end down by $20 million and the high end down by $40 million. Jim Gustafson : No, we did not, this is Jim Gustafson, because we had already incorporated the probability-weighted impact of this into our guidance. So that had already been incorporated into the guidance. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. So the potential to kind of pick up prior year revenue for things like this is something that we should expect to happen and therefore not -- every year and therefore not to adjust out of the operating income even though it is related to the prior year? Kent J. Thiry: Let me take a stab at that. There's a certain amount of puts and takes in an IBNR-intensive business that happen all the time. And so what we try to highlight for you is when there's an unusual number of them, which we've had a time or two in the last 18 months, and when it's more than normal offsetting puts and takes. Does that help answer -- there's no black and white answer. You never expect a year in this kind of business without some prior period adjustments, but you also don't expect too many of them. Is that answering the question? Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Well, I guess maybe the better way to ask it is when you talk about next year being better by $25 million, do you mean it off of this current guidance rather than off of the 2014 actual earnings in the current period? Kent J. Thiry: Okay, I get the question now. I apologize for missing it before. The comment on $25 million improvement was focused on the 2 significant new markets of New Mexico and Arizona, that in those competitive arenas, we are confident of a year-over-year $25 million OI improvement. That $25 million then would become a factor in the aggregate HCP performance, which we're not commenting on now. We were just highlighting a delta in those 2 new markets. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. But I guess -- I think you said that the network $25 million number was mostly new market. Is that right? So either with that extra new market income this year, you're going to do $25 million better than that next year? Kent J. Thiry: That is correct. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. All right. And then I guess when we think about -- you mentioned that there's a number of things that you're analyzing now, there's a number of things you've kind of got in the hopper for the next round of things. How do you think about the competitive landscape? I guess there was recently an article about how there's a record number of ACOs and doctors and hospitals competing for physician alignment and things like that. Do you as a company look at this and say, \"We kind of have to do more than maybe we're ready for in the next 12 to 24 months because if we wait 5 years, all the partners who are the strongest partners will have done something?\" How do you balance that as you analyze the opportunity set? Kent J. Thiry: Yes, very fair question. In general, on the one hand, there is increased supply of competition, more and more people trying to do population health management. On the other hand, there has been a proportional increase in demand for the same. And so I don't think there's been any fundamental change in the demand-supply relationship, which is what really matters, and nor are things going to happen quickly or I should say, there will not be a lot of successes quickly. An awful lot of the people who are getting into this space or who've gotten into it in the last year or 2 or 3 are failing, if not on an absolute basis, on a relative basis. And so I think from a strategic point of view, the important thing is to maintain a differentiated better product, and in that context, there'll be no shortage of opportunities for the next 5 to 10 years. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Kent, just wanted to kind of follow up on the ACO questions. What are your updated thoughts on the care coordination model and even maybe greater use of certain physicians maybe even in hospital medicine? Kent J. Thiry: Can you elaborate a little further on the question? I think I would be groping if I answered now. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Yes. Sure. So one of your big competitors recently made its entry into the Hospitalists industry, and it was kind of an interesting move. Obviously, a lot of hospital medicine is used in the ACO integrated care model. I'm wondering if you guys could look to expand into that area specifically in terms of improving the coordination of care between acute and post-acute patients. Kent J. Thiry: Okay. Let me take a stab at it. You let me know if I'm not responding. We have some of the best Hospitalists operations in America now embedded within our existing markets and up to this point, have opted not to try to create what we might call a vertical and take certain capabilities outside of our legacy markets and sell them, market them, implement them on an isolated vertical basis. However, strategically, that is something we talk about regularly. Just up to this point, we've never opted to do it. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : No. That's helpful. And then going back to your comments about population health management. Just wondering, what do you think are the keys to driving improvement in outcomes within population health management? And then also, do you think there are any hot button issues in that category as well? Kent J. Thiry: Well, I think one of the primary tenets of our answer to that question and one of the ways in which we're highly differentiated is that we believe putting the physicians in the spot of operating leadership is critical, and that's part of the legacy of HealthCare Partners, it's part of why we've been as successful as we've been. So I think that and investing in technology over the next 3, 5, 7 years, those are 2 of the primary components of the answer. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly -- no, actually, 2 questions. Thoughts on biogenerics coming in on the ESA front like Mircera. Do you have any pilots or plan to have any pilots where you could use new ESAs? And then could you prioritize uses of capital? Kent J. Thiry: Okay. On the biogenerics, we, of course, like any customer, like it when there's -- when our suppliers, whether they be vendors or partners, have competition. And so no surprise, we're in favor of there being new entrants into all products and drugs and biogenerics that we have to purchase. We're wildly in favor of that. And we will work with some companies bringing new stuff to the market if the terms make sense. And at the same time, we value very highly our historical relationship with Amgen and the clinical value of the drug that they provide. On the capital allocation, I think the way we've answered this best historically is to have people look in the rearview mirror and see that over 15 years, we've done a lot of different things in terms of our leverage ratio, in terms of buying back stock, in terms of paying down debt, in terms of changing the nature of our debt, in terms of investing in acquisitions and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And so I think we bring a pretty open mind to what is the right way to think about capital allocation that's very time-specific, fact-specific, et cetera, always trying to manage the risk-adjusted upside for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Could you talk a little bit about how you view the change of the risk adjusters next year on the Med Advantage business and how significant of a positive that could be to HCP? Kent J. Thiry: Well, I would just say, our expectations on that are baked into our guidance for this year, and next year, we've not provided guidance for. And certainly, whatever the government decides to do -- well, I guess, can you repeat the question? Are you talking about '15 or '16, Gary? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : '15. Kent J. Thiry: Well, there, we have the positive of some adjustments to what they were doing on risk adjustments versus the negative of reductions to the underlying rates. And so as we provide you with guidance for '15, there will be a netting of those 2 effects. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess how are you thinking about '16? Kent J. Thiry: Who knows? I mean it's just so hard to predict what the government is going to do with -- if they compress acuity scoring, that hurts us because we have a lot of high acuity patients, and we think it would be a big mistake for the Medicare program to do that because you want to attract investment in the ill people and make them healthier, that's when the whole system works in a virtuously reinforcing way, clinically and economically. So if they compress acuity scoring, that's bad. On the other hand, of course, if they leave that the same but drop underlying overall rates, that's bad too. So we kind of have to wait and see where they come out. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then your comments regarding new markets on HCP. It sounds somewhat more bullish than maybe you've been in the past. I guess in the past, you've talked about entering, refresh my memory, 2 or 3 markets this year, with a couple more next year and a lot more the year after that. Is that still the way to think about that? Or could that be accelerated somewhat? Kent J. Thiry: I would not presume any acceleration. And in fact, in the last quarter, I, if anything, nudged expectations towards deceleration. But I think that the difficulty here is sort of the unit of measure. We are going to do some new things and then probably more new things next year and more the year after and so on. If you just use that as sort of the crude metric, those words are probably still true. However, the math on a lot of those things is going to be quite small in the early years, just like Tandigm is not something that's going to have a huge, immense impact for a whole bunch of reasons tied to our strategy with our partner. And so the number of things we do might be quite significant, but the math of it is very hard to predict and is probably not going to be as significant as the unit number. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then probably maybe just an update on the recovery in Albuquerque? Kent J. Thiry: I don't think it's a good idea to go into a huge amount of individual market detail. Again, we did want to convey that in the 2 new markets that have been consuming the most resources, we're looking at a very nice year-over-year improvement, '15 over '14, and the odds of that will happen are very high. And probably just leave it at that. As you do know, the government approved the acquisition by Blue Cross Blue Shield of the MA plan, and that's a good thing for us because it puts us back in network and our number of lives, our MA lives has gone up in a very nice fashion since then. But to start slicing and dicing it, I don't think is a good idea. The aggregate math is probably the best way to characterize it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Margaret Kaczor, William Blair. Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : A few for me. First, you guys haven't talked about the number of international patients you have right now in a while. What is that number today? Kent J. Thiry: Between 5,000 and 6,000 at this point. Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then at what point really does that become material? Because I think that's about 100% growth year-over-year. Is that right? Kent J. Thiry: Off hand, I don't know, but it must be something in that ballpark. It's -- we have not provided a forecast of patient growth internationally for a reason because there's going to be too wide a range of outcomes at this point. We've been very pleased with the growth that's exceeded our expectations. And so I think we just have to stop there and keep on reporting it. But it's too -- there's too much uncertainty right now as you divide it across the 10 countries that we're operating in to allow us to give you a high confidence forecast. Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the growth in home dialysis? Are you guys still investing in that? Is there still opportunity in PD or HHD? Or is it kind of penetrated now with the bundle? Kent J. Thiry: Home dialysis continues to grow, and we think that trend will continue. Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then one more for me. Can you give any update on kind of the dual eligible contracts that you've seen right now in California? Is it something you've kind of been walking away from right now or still kind of in negotiations? When should we hear something about that? Kent J. Thiry: We're quite excited about dual, strategically, and we have 1 contract buttoned up and signed and a few thousand lives already signed up. And at this point, we would estimate in that contract alone, we might very well end up with 10,000 or so. In addition, we're still in discussions with a couple of other parties. But even with this 1 contract, we're very excited that we're going to get an opportunity to develop some new muscles and demonstrate the power of some old ones. And so, so far that's playing itself out very, very nicely and hopefully going to lead to a lot of growth in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch, Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to ask on HCP. If you can talk at all about how your payer contracts have evolved, if at all. Imagine with all the changing reimbursement, is that a place where you had intense negotiations over the last year? Or is it then sort of steady state on that front? Kent J. Thiry: Yes, there've been intense negotiations. And as we've said consistently, the portfolio of contracts will be amended over time and, in general, where we come from, is making them more and more partnership-oriented, with aligned upside and downside as opposed to confrontational upside, downside or whatever is the opposite of aligned. And some payers are very philosophically open to that, others are not. Hence -- and in either case, there's intense negotiations as to what that means. So we've made some nontrivial progress, but the portfolio will take a while to resolve itself. And some parts will never be aligned. Just like in Kidney Care, when we stated that we wanted to move towards more bundled contracts in the private sector, we did so over 5 years, but still, to this day, are not to the point where every private contract is bundled. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And given some of the challenges that you had with HCP, has that made you think more or less about the possibility of offering HCP as its own plan, if you will, either on your own or in some form of partnership? Is that something that you have any change in interest in, in the last 2 years? Kent J. Thiry: No. It hasn't changed our views on that at all, which is to say, strategically, we are open to being a plan. If at any point that makes strategic sense and if we have the right relationships and contracts with existing plans that may never be necessary. Operator : And there are no further questions on the phone at this time. Kent J. Thiry: Okay. Thank you, all, for your interest in DaVita HealthCare Partners, and we will do our best for you over the next 3 months. Have a good day. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Kim, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Garry Menzel, our CFO; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn over the call to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry: Thank you, Jim, and greetings to all. Thank you for your consideration of our company. In Q3, we had solid results in Kidney Care, in HealthCare Partners and overall. Kidney Care OI being $408 million, adjusted for nonrecurring items, and HealthCare Partners being $47 million. As always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first, because we are, first and foremost, a caregiving entity. On the Kidney Care side in America, we take care of 35% of all the dialysis patients. 98% of our patients achieved a Kt/V of 1.2 or better and 73% of patients have a fistula in place. Turning to HealthCare Partners and our 836,000 human beings for whom we provide integrated care. I'd like to talk a little bit about 2013 HEDIS clinical metrics, which most of you are familiar with. There are 12 clinical measures in HEDIS, all of which feed into the Star rating system. And I'm looking at a page right now that has those 12 rows and it has 3 columns, one for each of our legacy markets. So a total of 36 cells. 24 of those 36 are 5-star rankings, 7 of them are 4. And then there's only 5 left that are 3, with none below. There are very few providers of any scale in the entire MA program that would have anywhere close to a rating system like that, and we're proud of it. It's good for patients and it's good for our payer partners. The clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners compare very favorable -- very favorably, excuse me, to national averages. We have healthier patients. We have higher patient satisfaction. And both of those things, besides being good in and of themselves, saves money for taxpayers and employers. Now a little elaboration on HCP's operating performance, which was solid. You'll note that the guidance assumes lower margins in the fourth quarter. This is a normal trend because of the fact that sicker patients with higher risk scores expire as the year proceeds. Younger, healthier patients age into MA, and there's typically some uptick in medical utilization as we enter the winter months. On the HealthCare Partners business development. We've increased the level of activity modestly. And it's a lot of high-quality conversations that have been started. We still have a long way to go in terms of capabilities, and the sales cycle itself is long. But the way we think about it is pretty much divided in 2 categories : mainstream and new models partnership. On the mainstream front, as most of you know, we recently announced an exciting acquisition of Colorado Springs Health Partners, the leading group in Colorado Springs, Colorado. And we look forward to growing with them, not only leading them into a world of coordinated care, but also growing on the fee-for-service side. And then, separately, we've got a number of creative and exciting hospital partnerships at the very serious stage, one of which was announced today. A 50/50 joint venture with the Centura Health system here in Colorado. It's a leading health system in the state. These 2 different Colorado deals are entirely separate. We are the 100% owner of the Colorado Springs health care partner group, but we look forward to having our group work with the joint venture with Centura and, moving forward, pursuing and managing global contracts. We'd also like to initiate 2015 guidance. The enterprise guidance is $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion. In other words, relatively flat to the current reality. Underneath that, the Kidney Care operating income, $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. This reflects the sad fact that it'll be the second year in a row with no Medicare increase, and we'll face normal cost increases. Things are getting more intense because of stuff like this. We expect to have 15 center closures by the end of the year. That's more than any other year I can remember. And we are still carrying 200 unprofitable centers after that point, and that's excluding any new de novos. It's also a tougher commercial pay environment. The growth in more restrictive narrow-network plans means that we may very well lose some market share on the commercial side, as we will be unwilling to accept lower commercial rates. We need, unfortunately, high commercial rates to subsidize the losses that we incur in the 90% of our patients that are government. Moving on to HealthCare Partners and guidance of $225 million to $275 million. This also reflects relatively flat MA reimbursement in the face of normal cost increases. And on top of that, we are investing in infrastructure and capability improvements. And finally, we will, once again, always have some losses in new markets, or at least hopefully always, as we hope to enter some new markets each year. And in many cases, the most capital efficient way to do that is with low-capital models that therefore have losses, operating losses, in their early years. Moving on to 2016. We'd like to go beyond providing 2015 guidance in this case, because we have 2 serious headwinds that are potentially quite material. The first of those and the biggest is Medicare reimbursement on both sides of the house. And then, secondarily, the tough commercial pay environment, that I already cited on the Kidney Care side, is not going to go away in 2015. And so, that -- or those 2, combined with the earnings headwinds that will come from the new markets we hope to enter, means that while it's too early to provide any specific guidance for 2016, the factors I just mentioned lead us to need to communicate to you that there is a real risk that 2016 operating income could be lower than 2015. I'd like to segue into a quick editorial on Medicare Advantage, in particular, and just the incredible importance of CMS needing to get those rates correct. America needs the sickest patients to join Medicare Advantage and those likely to become the sickest, because those are the patients where we add the most clinical value for the patient and economic value for the country. And we are at risk of moving into a danger zone, where the economics of making the right investments in those 2 sets of patients become unsustainable. If I step back from 2015 and '16 for a moment and just quickly look at the strategic position of our primary businesses. U.S. Kidney Care is well positioned, as we've talked about in the past. We have strong clinical outcomes and that increasingly matters. We're growing faster than the market. It's a life-saving therapy. And our ability to manage total patient costs, not just dialysis costs, is increasingly differentiated. However, we do live in the uncomfortable world where we rely on higher private pay rates to subsidize the government. On the HealthCare Partners front, despite a rocky first 18 months, the fundamental value proposition remains intact. Integrated care and population health management are what we do well, and that's what lots of people want to move to. We have a solid foundation in our legacy markets. And I'd like to talk about what I'm focused on in the near term, since I've now been quite engaged for 4 or 5 months. Not in order of importance, but number one, adding to the team; number two, adding to the capabilities; number three, fix the problem spots; number four, explore new partnership models, a couple of which I've already talked about; and number five is pursue selective growth. All of this is, in the context for HealthCare Partners, good news, which is that everyone expects MA growth to continue because it is a superior way of taking care of people and taking care of America's economics. On the international front, I'll just say we're continuing to make solid progress. Of course, there is risk in that venture, but the potential is huge as health care service is a growth industry across the globe. Now Garry Menzel, our CFO, will cover some more stuff. Garry E. Menzel: Thank you, KT. Starting with Kidney Care. Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.9% when normalized for days of the week. Profitability was up $6 million sequentially. Our international losses were $13 million for the quarter and we now expect those losses for 2014 to be slightly above $40 million. For the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $100 million in the third quarter. This is a good run rate for debt expense going forward. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $36 million in the third quarter, which is also a good run rate going forward. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 38.7% in the quarter, and we now expect the full year rate for 2014 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40%. Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows, as operating cash flow was $848 million in the third quarter and $1.88 billion over the last 12 months. This was unusually high due to : one, the timing of cash tax payments; and two, the timing of various working capital items, in particular a reduction in accounts receivable DSO, which we do not expect to repeat next year. We now expect operating cash flow to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion in 2014, excluding any payments associated with the settlement with the government. We expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, lower than 2014, but in line with our historical trends. The reason for this year-on-year decline is that 2015 will not benefit from the 2 factors that helped 2014 : number one, the cash tax benefit related to our refinancing; and again, number two, the timing of various working capital items, in particular the reduction in accounts receivable DSO. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. Finally, some comments on capital deployment. Even after making the $400 million government payment last week, we have a very strong cash balance today. We are in the fortunate position of having various opportunities, where we may be able to deploy our capital in each of our business lines. We are constantly reviewing our capital allocation to make sure that we sustain the long-term health of the organization and achieve appropriate aftertax cash returns on capital. To put our historical practices in context, in the 5-year period prior to the HealthCare Partners transaction, we allocated 40% of our capital to acquisitions, 23% to internal development, 26% to share repurchases and 11% to debt repayments. We favor a situational approach to capital deployment and will continue to review our options. And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q and A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess my first question is around 2015 guidance. And just hoping to get a bit more color on what sort of assumptions you're making in heading into next year. And just especially, if you look at that dialysis side, guiding down year-over-year. Just curious to get a bit more insight into what's behind that number. Kent J. Thiry: I don't know that we have much to add because it really is driven by the stuff we mentioned, the absence of a Medicare increase for the second consecutive year. We did an awful lot of expense squeezing in the face of the first flat year and can't do that again with the same kind of return, and then just what's happening on the commercial pay side and some of that dynamics there. Those are the big issues. Those are the drivers. It's not a lot more complicated than that. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And can you remind us what percentage of your commercial volumes are -- what percentage is commercial volumes on the dialysis side? Kent J. Thiry: About 10%. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : About 10%. And then you mentioned some on the issues on the HCP side. And since taking over leadership, you've identified some areas you want to address. Could you give us a bit more on just sort of what you mean by fixing problem spots and pursuing selected growth? Kent J. Thiry: Sure. In the case of fixing problem spots, I'm referring to the 2 deals that were done right after the close by some of the prior executives that didn't work out well. And we've, in fact, made strong progress in the last 5 months on each of those. And we referred to that in our last call, where we said we're going to be -- we're still confident that we're highly likely to be more than $25 million better in '15 versus '14. I should say, $25 million more or better, but $25 million is probably the best number to remember. So that's the fixing problem spots I was referring to and that's going quite well. On the selective growth, I think the 2 best examples to make that more tangible are the deals that we've talked about this week, which is, one, the purchase of a leading physician group in a substantial American metro area. And second, a health system joint venture, where we still have to sort through all the terms of the definitive but we're -- both sides are very committed to driving it to closure and moving forward. So those are 2 examples of selective growth. Am I answering the right question? Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. I'm just curious to get a bit more detail behind that -- those initiatives. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Wanted to follow up on the question on dialysis and maybe come at it from just a different angle in terms of 2015 outlook. Kent, over the last few years, your actual dialysis results have been significantly better than what you've guided to initially. I'm just curious if you could look back at the actual versus expectations, and give us any color around what those upside drivers were, if there's any consistency there. Kent J. Thiry: A fair question. I don't know that I can spontaneously do a good job of going back 2 or 3 years, but let's play with it for a moment and see if we can add some value. I know in these past 12 months, the concerns we had about exchanges turned out to be much greater than the reality. And so that was one very big dynamic and one very big variance. I'm trying to go back to the prior year and I'm just not sure on that one, Justin. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. So in the -- I guess you're saying that -- and I think payer mix and just private pay, whether it's mix issues or reimbursement pressure in general, seems to have been -- in addition to whatever rate pressure you're facing on Medicare, has been something that the company has faced and obviously done a good job over time. And we'll see if you -- we'll see how we go for 2015. I guess my question is, when you look at those, if we just direct it at the commercial pay side, that's been an area of potential pressure and ended up being better than expected or less significant than expected, if we're going to use those words. Then, is there any reason for us to believe -- is there a higher level of conviction that this time it's going to be different versus the last 2 or 3 years, where it's been less meaningful than you thought? Or do you feel like this is just the typical level of prudent posture going into a new year? Kent J. Thiry: Yes, very fair question. Maybe let me use an analogy. If you win the first 2 games of the World Series and you're about to start game 3 and you're up against a superb team that made it all the way to World Series, you don't look at the rearview mirror and say, \"Well, we won the first 2 and therefore it's 80% probable we're going to win game 3.\" You say, \"Against a tough competitor, you win some, you lose some, but you don't win them all.\" And I think we have to look at our never-ending battle, if you want to call it that, with private payers to say that, \"Yes, we've been able to hold the line,\" in part because our entire industry needs to subsidize the government, and so it's a common plight. But whatever the reason, we've had a couple of good years. We just think it would be inappropriate to, therefore, by -- based on that rearview mirror, pretty view, get overly confident about next year. Separate from that metaphor, which I think is important, but beyond that, it is also just a case that there's a lot going on in the commercial sector and many of you are more facile in discussing it than me. But it's -- and players are getting more and more creative with what they're doing on benefit design. They're getting much more open to doing different things, with exchanges and narrow networks just being one example. And so when 10% of your patients drive, whatever, 115% of your profitability, I'm not going to get the exact number right, but the subsidization of the Medicare program is substantial from the private sector, that you've got to pay a lot of attention, because relatively small changes can wreak a lot of havoc in your year-over-year momentum. And so I would posit and we would posit that the world is different in '15 versus what it was in '14. And if you had to say, does it lean different harder or easier? You would lean harder. And in particular, for us, because the way it could show up is that not we lose rate, it's that we lose share to other people who are willing to cut rates. And that's something that we can't control. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Garry, maybe could you give us a little bit more color on the reduction in the DSOs? Is that just a timing thing? Or was there one specific payer or something that's going on? Garry E. Menzel: It isn't one specific thing, Gary. It's just a trend that we've had over the last 18 months or so, but it's not something that we expect to continue. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Is it around a specific item or a specific dynamic? Or is it just a whole bunch of different things? James K. Hilger: Gary, this is Jim Hilger. It is a number of different things. It's improved collection processes and results. We've also had high write-offs. You can see our Medicare bad debt expense percentage was increased in the quarter. But we feel very good about the quality of our AR. But in aggregate, all of these things are driving our DSO down. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Wouldn't collection -- more proficiency with collections, wouldn't that carry forward, though? James K. Hilger: Yes. But the structural impediments to improving DSO from 50 days are quite large when you look at the fact that our biggest payer, Medicare, pays us about 22 days after the end of the month. So when you factor that into the math, it's going to be very hard to significantly lower DSO from here. But it doesn't mean that we can't try, but it will be hard to do big strides. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Got it. That's helpful. And then, Kent, the other large national dialysis provider said they'd begin doing tests with Mircera in the U.S. this quarter. Do you guys have any plans to do that? Kent J. Thiry: Not right now, but we're very open-minded on the topic. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then assuming that, that drug is available in the U.S. at some point in 2015, have you baked that into the guidance at all? Kent J. Thiry: Well, I'd say that we bake everything into our guidance. And trying to predict -- and especially the history in this arena, trying to predict when something, in fact, is going to be introduced and how it's going to be introduced and how it will be priced and how penetration will evolve is really hard. So I don't think we presumed anything particularly bullish or world-changing in that regard. However, we do think the fact that competition is highly likely in the near and intermediate term is a good thing for everybody. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess even as you go into 2016, the potential for perhaps 3 competitors on the market for the drug, have you taken that into account when you're thinking about 2016? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. We've taken it into account. But, again, while we're not sharing our different probabilistic scenarios and the math associated with the each, because obviously there's a range of outcomes and all the variables I cited before, that we are hopeful for a meaningful change. But within the time frame of 1 year, or 15, 18 months, we're not presuming that life is fundamentally altered in a dramatic way. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. I mean, maybe just to go down that route a little bit more. I mean, if in 2016, there were 3 drugs available and you -- isn't it conceivable you could see a 20% decrease to price on costs that's over $1 billion for you? Kent J. Thiry: Well, we do think that new entrants are going to have to offer lower prices to get penetration, just period. There's no 2 ways around it, and it's going to have to be significant. We also think strategically that Amgen is going to want to stay competitive, as they have in other countries around the world in similar situations. And so that all, directionally, is very good news. And at the same time, we just want to remind people that if the entire community realizes certain benefits from cost reduction that, ultimately, that will appropriately be reflected in Medicare reimbursement. Now since we're at a deficit, we still should come out ahead, because part of what Medicare hopefully will do is start to reduce the deficit. But the notion that they would let anything along the lines of what you mentioned just flow through permanently, I think that's unlikely. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe could we get an update on the Tandigm partnership and how that's doing? Kent J. Thiry: It's doing fine, but it's so early that it doesn't mean so much. We've got a wonderful response from the physicians in the community. We're in high-quality conversations with a bunch of the hospitals. IBC and us and Tandigm are working very well together, but it's a little bit like the preseason. The real tackling doesn't start until January 1, so we don't want to get too excited about winning some of the preseason games. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : This is actually Joanna Gajuk, filling in for Kevin today. Just question -- follow-up on the comment around 2015 guidance again. I guess, just specifically the comments around the loss from, I guess, new deals. So are you including additional transactions on top of what you just recently did? And I guess in relation to that, can you comment on your comments from prior calls around trying to enter 2, 3 new markets next year and more after that? So is that what you sort of bake into your outlook when you talk about '15 and then, I guess, '16 as well? Kent J. Thiry: We would be disappointed if we didn't do, on the HealthCare Partners side, 2 good new deals next year. And by saying new, that probably means in new markets as opposed to an additional one, an existing market. Anything done on those places will probably be less material. And then we're presuming that one or both of them could be of a similar structure to the ones we're doing now, where we are launching a substantial population health management initiative. And therefore, in the beginning, you've got operating losses, just like when we build a de novo on the dialysis side. So that's how we think those 2016 losses will emerge. Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then on, again, on HCP. I guess on the quarter that you just reported, the G&A costs of I guess $86 million versus $77 million in Q2, and I guess as a percentage of revenues also increased. So any comment on that? Garry E. Menzel: Yes, it's Garry. First of all, on the margin, you have to remember it varies by quarter because of a number of different factors : seasonality, there are nonrecurring items in there, there are government true-ups. And so I will point out, though, that across the year, we have maintained consistent cost trends. Operator : And our next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I did want to just come back to part of what you were asked before about the investment that you're making in some of these activities. And I guess I was just hoping if you could bucket them a little bit better for us for 2015, just so we can maybe isolate some of the underlying trends in both segments. So just taking them apart. In international, can you give us some flavor for how you're thinking about the investment there? And duals, I know that that's something that you'll be ramping up your lives in California, I think. So is that an investment? Is that a positive? And then to the extent that JVs in other new markets that you've just announced here with HCP require investment, what does that look like? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. Fair question, Darren. And maybe we'll lay out more math next time. I don't think I'm well prepared to do that right now. But I would say international in '15 will be comparable to '14, with the ramp-up in Saudi and the rest of our growth, so that'll be comparable. And then, duals, I wish we could tell you exactly what that number is going to be, but we've got to watch that population very carefully, and we'll keep you posted. But right now, it wouldn't be right to speculate. And then, on the joint venture side, given they're so young, it's really hard for us to go very far in a satisfactory way because there's so many variables, and we just don't know. We can feel good about where it's going to be 2 years from now, 3 years from now, 4 years from now. But the notion that we can predict operating losses in months 1 through 15, that would be -- while we have our pro formas that we're managing against, there's a pretty significant range of possible outcomes. Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. So well, I guess, the follow-up then is just when we think about maybe how you've communicated around Tandigm, and I think there have been some numbers floating around. But the sizing of that, so 50,000-or-so lives, in that type of JV versus what we're reading about today, Centura, 1.2 million lives over time. Obviously, a very different type of situation. But just trying to understand a little bit more about how some of the investments flows might be related to these different types of JVs so we can at least just frame that in the model from a new market perspective. Kent J. Thiry: Yes. I think we have to get better at working with you on that, Darren, you and your peers. And I will not make any great progress in that area on this call today. And then, on the Centura, we cherish our partner's optimism, and they have far more experience in this market than we do. Nonetheless, our pro forma does not have 1.2 million lives in year 5, and so we would hate to have you bake that in. But we sure as heck hope they're smarter than we are. Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : All right, last thing for me. Just you brought up 2016, you're obviously cautioning us. I guess what is it about 2016? If you could, maybe, list 1 or 2 things that keep you up the most and that we ought to be rethinking about in our models? Kent J. Thiry: Okay. I'll be redundant and then we can go back and forth and see if we add some incremental value. Game 1 is just Medicare on both sides of the house. What are they going to do with rates? And in some cases, what are they going to do with certain architectural rules and regs that equate to significant math? But it's Medicare and it's rates. And then, second is this commercial side, just given how darn leveraged it is. And when there's so many things going on in that space, it's just a little nerve-wracking for us, particularly when it could come down to us, as I mentioned before, losing share out of our control because we can't run around offering discounts. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Malik with Everest. Vijay Malik : I just wanted to circle back on capital allocation, which you discussed earlier. Specifically, you mentioned, prior to the HCP acquisition, 26% of your free cash flow was used for repurchases. About 6 months ago on the call, I highlighted, at the end of the year, you might have $2 billion of cash in the balance sheet. And the question of capital allocation, what to do with that cash is becoming increasingly important every quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how you evaluate share repurchases? Obvious, relative to other opportunities you see out there, but it's hard to believe that a company trading x cash at 10x free cash flow might not be -- your best investment opportunity is just repurchasing stock. Garry E. Menzel: So thank you. It's Garry. First of all, I do want to point out, we won't have $2 billion in cash at the end of the year. So I'll highlight that. Secondly, I think it's important as you listen to the call that whenever you enter into a period of uncertainty, which we are flagging today, that you do owe it to the shareholders to ensure that you maintain a strong cash reserve to go through that period of uncertainty. So that's certainly informing our thinking. And then, beyond that, we look at all of the opportunities that we have in front of us, both for internal development, both for acquisition growth, and then as you point out, share repurchases or debt paydowns. And we take a very situational approach with each one of those to determine what is the appropriate option for us to follow. I don't think we can disclose much beyond that, other than to let you know that this is something that we do, month-by-month, intensely study. Kent J. Thiry: And the only thing I'll add to that is when we talk about times of uncertainty, mean logically that you should hold more cash -- very simplistic, obviously -- that's not just for defensive reasons. It's also in times of uncertainty that there's a way-above-average probability of offensive opportunities popping up. And so we're equally defense- and offensive-minded as we stare at that decision. Vijay Malik : Understandable. When I see the cash on the balance sheet and I don't see share repurchases, it makes me excited about the opportunities you must be evaluating. I, obviously, think very highly of the management team. And frankly, I think it's an asset that Wall Street might be missing. Kent J. Thiry: We hope you are right, and we will do our best to make you right. Please don't put anything in your model. Vijay Malik : There's no model. It's in my head. Operator : Your next question comes from -- I'm sorry, the next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citi. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : A couple of questions. One, I just want to go back to EPO unit cost for a minute. Everyone knows you have the exclusive contract with Amgen through 2017. It seems obvious there's no EPO unit price reduction in the Kidney operating income guidance that it could be flat 2 years in a row. So I guess to get to it, what is the scenario that you can benefit from EPO unit price declines before the Amgen contract expires? Kent J. Thiry: There's some elements of the contract that we're not allowed to disclose. What is publicly known is that we have the right to buy 10% elsewhere, and what is known in the sense of sort of common sense and business wisdom is that they are going to want to remain competitive. And in a contract, in either direction, if one party takes excessive advantage of a short-term provision, that typically has really fundamental implications for the long-term relationship. And so the contract has certain things that we like and certain things that they like and separate from that, we have a long-standing business relationship. And in general, it's our expectation that they'll remain competitive. Do you want to -- I don't know that I can shed any more light on it than that. Do you want to come back at it, again? Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : No. I won't. I mean, it sounds like you to hope to renegotiate, by I won't put words in your mouth. And I don't know if you want to respond to that or not, probably not. Kent J. Thiry: No. Thank you. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : If not, I will -- my next question, just going into the commercial rates. A couple of questions. So it's November 6, today, when do you -- when are 2015 commercial rates finalized? Don't you have pretty significant visibility as we stand today? Kent J. Thiry: No. The way it works is we're negotiating contracts all year long, every week, every month, every year. And lots of times, a contract expires and people just extend it because the negotiations go on another month to 12 months. A lot of times, there's notice provisions and so they automatically renew for a certain period of time, but it's not another year. We have agreements that end every month of the year, even if they're 1-year contracts. So the practical reality is that we are negotiating with payers all the time. And often, it goes months past the technical expiration of the prior contract and we just -- everything is just held in the steady-state while the to-ing and fro-ing is going on. So there's never really a time when you say, \"Okay, we've now sort of nailed down what's happening next year.\" I bet it's only a tiny fraction of our contracts that even have a January 1 effective date or renewal date. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And my one follow-on on that will just be, it sounds like you're suggesting competitors willing to discount rates. I guess kind of our view of the construct of the industry is that you might have 1/3 national market share, but your local market shares are actually often significantly higher than that and, generally, the industry operates at pretty high capacity utilization. So the opportunity for discounters to move share would suggest perhaps there's some significant capacity adds in the industry, although maybe that just means being open on Saturday and Sunday. But are you suggesting that you're seeing capacity adds and that's going to create this opportunity for competitors to provide the service at a lower rate? Or is there something else? Kent J. Thiry: The short answer to the question you asked is no. We're not positing any immense capacity adds. Having said that, incremental capacity is quite straightforward to add because you add a third shift or you add a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday to your Monday, Wednesday, Friday. But more often, it's adding a shift or, in some cases, adding another station or 2 to an existing shift. So there's a lot of capacity that can be added quickly at relatively low cost. But that's actually not the #1 issue. The #1 issue is when private pay is only 10% of your patients, it doesn't take very many bodies to be moved to someone discounting before you materially affect your year-over-year contribution but don't put any serious incremental burden of capacity on the system. Operator : The next will come from Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Two questions. Just another on the private rates on the dialysis side. A year ago, you had mentioned your frustration that a competitor was apparently giving a bit more in price. It sounded like it was around one particularly large contract. And when we last got a comment on this, I think your words were something along the lines that both sides were particularly unhappy, and it sounded like you'd sort of stuck to the status quo. Can you just give us an update on that particular situation? And is that perhaps part of your seemingly more downbeat view on commercial pricing for 2015? And then, a second question on private rates, actually not commercial rates, but Medicare Advantage. You talk a lot about MA in your HealthCare Partners business. But as MA overall has increased as a proportion of all seniors, I would imagine this should have some potentially positive mix effect for the dialysis business. Could just perhaps talk about MA patient count? How that's changed? And whether that does, in fact, have a bit of a margin benefit? Kent J. Thiry: Let me answer the second one first, and I mean I'll probably ask you to ask the first one again because it had sort of 2 parts to it. I want to make sure I don't ramble here, or at least reduce the probability. But on MA, MA growth is good for HealthCare Partners and it's good for Kidney Care. We love it in Kidney Care because those customers, talking about MA plans as customers, care about total costs, and we're really good at that. And so -- both from an immediate margin point of view and from a value-added point of view, and therefore, that informs future rates. We really do like MA growth in the ESRD population. That answered your second question, correct? Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Yes. Kent J. Thiry: And then -- go ahead. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Yes, I was just -- actually one second -- maybe a second add-on to that second question is, you mentioned the -- MA's focus on total costs. Could you also just provide a comment on Fresenius' recent agreement with Aetna on their MA patients? And is that something that you could see moving forward with, with any major commercial players? Kent J. Thiry: We don't know all the details of what they did with Aetna. We know some stuff, and we certainly believe in integrated care and pay-for-performance. And so we're in those sorts of conversations as well, and we would expect FMC to be continuing to do that sort of stuff. And the good news in it is more and more payers are interested and willing to spend the time in actually going through all the hours of discussion and negotiation that are required. A few years ago, Kidney Care just wasn't high enough on the radar screen to get the attention to actually do more sophisticated contracts where everybody can win. So that's the community-wide good news inherent in announcements like that. And beyond that, I would just have to guess that we're both doing similar things. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And yes, my first question, it's really -- I guess a way of rephrasing it is you seem a bit more downbeat on commercial pricing. Clearly, exchanges are one part of that. But I remember you very specifically had mentioned a year ago that there was one major contract, where it sounded like your big competitor had taken a bit of a rate cut. And you had resolved that issue by sort of sticking with the status quo. And I'm wondering whether you've had to shift away from that status quo, and that's one of the reasons why you're potentially a bit more negative in the commercial outlook for the next 12 months. Kent J. Thiry: Yes. We did have a situation, as we talked about and had an obligation to inform you of, where we had serious concerns about a competitor offering serious volume-related discounts, and that would affect industry structure in the way that shareholders would need to know about it. So that did happen. And then, second and totally separate, we've maintained pricing discipline, rate discipline. And we're willing to give up market share in order to do that, because it's very difficult to see a path where we're able to continue to innovate and drive the transformative parts of what we're about in terms of reducing total costs. We just can't do that without some margin. Operator : At this time, I show no further questions. Kent J. Thiry: Okay. Well, thanks very much. I mean, I will add I guess one other point that -- because it's related to what we were just talking about with Lisa. That it is, our patients are uniquely discriminated against. American dialysis patients are uniquely discriminated against in 2 ways, that if their kidney has already failed, they cannot join an MA plan, which is an absolute terrible policy, because it robs them of extra services that improve health and save the system money. So it's an artifact, but a legitimate concern from 25 years ago that doesn't apply anymore, and we really hope it gets changed. And secondarily, our patients are uniquely discriminated against in that they, no matter how many years they pay private insurance premiums, because they wanted insurance in case they got quite sick, they're kicked off of it after 30 months. A situation that no other American faces. And so those are 2 policy areas where we do hope for change. And thanks, everyone, for your kind consideration, and we'll do our best for you between now and the next earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Kim, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Garry Menzel, our CFO; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry: Okay. Thank you, Jim, and greetings to all. Thank you for your interest in our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, we had solid results, all sides of the house. Kidney Care OI, $419 million, but that includes the net $29 million benefit from recognizing the deferred Medi-Cal revenues, so $390 million without that. And HCP OI, $33 million, both results within our previously provided guidance ranges. We'll cover clinical outcomes first, as we do every call. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. CMS issued final QIP results on the Kidney Care side of the house recently. Once again, we led industry. Only 1.5% of our clinics had a 2015 penalty versus the overall industry's 5.6%. In other words, 73% more. This means we've outperformed the rest of the industry each year since that program began 4 years ago and in fact, remained first in 3 of 4 QIP categories this time. We also are leading the industry in 2015 Star rating results with over 50% of DaVita facilities receiving a Star rating of 4 or 5 versus 21% of the rest of the industry. So we're very proud of these results. And while no particular clinical metric by itself or system by itself is perfect, in aggregate, this is indisputably a strong performance for our patients and for the system. And we hope CMS continues to report clinical metrics, and we'll work on them to do so -- and work with them to do so. On the HealthCare Partners side, similarly strong news. Over 800,000 patients now for whom we take comprehensive care. If we just grab Nevada, 1 of our 3 largest markets, and look at cancer screening and diabetes. We have 4 or 5 Star across all of our Medicare Advantage patients, including some other factoid, 70% of our patients receiving colorectal cancer screenings compared to a national average of 65%, and 63% of our diabetic patients with cholesterol scores below 100. Both of those are 5 Star scores and that's compared also to a 55% national average. So for the clinical outcomes throughout the enterprise, very strong. We take it very seriously. And in all these cases, healthier patients leads to savings to America's taxpayers, hopefully a value-add that we can increasingly monetize for you. Let's talk a little bit about HCP operating performance now and expected, and Garry will talk a little bit more about Kidney Care. HCP, $33 million NOI, right in the middle of the guidance for the quarter. But let's hit the bad news right up front, and that is that CMS may make multiple changes to Medicare Advantage reimbursement. And in aggregate, this could mean that HealthCare Partners 2016 NOI could be below and even well below 2015, so unambiguous, potential bad news on that side. We incorrectly handicapped the Medicare Advantage reimbursement cuts last year, and I apologize that -- for that. I got it wrong. This actually is becoming a strategic issue for Medicare Advantage in our minds that it is crucial for CMS to protect the incentive to innovate to create health where now there is sickness and reduce risk where it is high for these patients, and we hope they realize that in their near-term decision-making. Now let's switch to the good news front and here, I'll make 4 significant points. One has already been referred to, the strong clinical outcomes. Two, in our legacy markets, MA enrollment was up 7% year-over-year, meaning January '15 over January '14, excluding acquisitions. And if you include in-market acquisitions, it goes up to 10%. So that's fact #2. Fact #3 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, MA enrollment a year ago was 2,500. It's now about 11,000. And fee-for-service visits per provider are up 20% from last year's low point. And then fact #4 on the positive side of the ledger. We told you 18 months ago that we were going to be exploring 4 different segments : growth through IPAs, growth through payer partners, growth through health system partners and growth through acquiring prominent medical groups. We did the Phoenix IPA back right around that time and since that time, we've done a significant payer partnership, a significant health system partnership and a significant acquisition of a prominent medical group. On the payer's side, Tandigm was a 50/50 JV with Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, the largest health plan in that region, now over 275 PCPs signed up, another 75 joining within about a month. We currently are taking care of 16,000 Medicare Advantage patients; 53,000 commercial patients, about $400 million in annualized revenue being managed in that partnership. The next segment, health systems. We've got a 50/50 JV with Centura, partnering in Colorado. And there it's a very substantial number of doctors. They alone have about 340 employed physicians, a mix of PCPs and specialists as well as a broader network. That's Centura, the largest health system in the State of Colorado. And then the last segment, leading medical groups. As many of you recall, we did acquire a leading group in Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs Health Partners with 51 PCPs. So the message here is that 18 months ago, 20 months ago, we said that we're going to explore growth models in each of those 4 segments. Now 18 to 20 months later, we are doing just that with a strong entry in each one of those segments in order to explore the most capital-efficient, risk-adjusted, optimal ways of growing as the years go by. We continue to be very modest in our business development investment, although it is growing incrementally. Having said that, however, the activities are quite robust. In particular we're in discussions with several major health systems and in particular, in Southern California in some very interesting discussions with a few different health systems, and we look forward to deciding which ones to actually drive to closure and may do some very interesting things. And that's separate from health systems. We're also talking to several high-quality medical groups in a serious way. No one ever knows what's going to happen with the business pipeline, but the quality and quantity of the conversations we're having is better than ever before. Our business development capabilities, as I said, is still quite modest. And hopefully over the next year or so, that will change. Although right now we couldn't deal with any more effective business development, since we're pretty much at capacity. With respect to overall guidance, it is $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion, which is relatively flat. It's made up of Kidney Care operating income. $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion; and HCP Operating income, $225 million to $275 million. I would like to reiterate the comments I made last earnings call, and that is we face 2 serious headwinds right now for the enterprise. Medicare reimbursement on both sides of the house under a lot of pressure in different forms. And on the Kidney Care side, a tough commercial pay environment as you look out over the next few years. Not so much because of any change in negotiating dynamics or leverage, but because of architectural changes in the way the healthcare system is working. When you put all that together, as we said, the last earnings call, there is real risk that 2016 OI could be down from 2015 at the enterprise level. Now even in a scenario where OI is flat, if we just take that premise for a moment, if you look out over the next 2 years between our current cash balance and our free cash flow and then you take out maintenance CapEx, still assume very robust dialysis de novos, and we make our mandatory debt payments. So after doing those 3 things, business as usual, we will still have $2.4 billion in cash to deploy in whatever way we thought was best for you and for the long-term strategic value of the enterprise. So acquisitions, buybacks, et cetera. We very much look forward to discussing our longer-term strategic positioning and our outlook at our Capital Markets Day in New York City on May 5, in conjunction with our Q1 earnings call. More details will come out soon, and we hope to see many of you there and satisfactorily answer all your questions. Garry, our CFO, please take over. Garry E. Menzel: Thanks, KT. Starting with Kidney Care. Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.6% when normalized for days of the week. Kidney Care operating profitability was up $11 million sequentially, primarily as a result of 2 factors : first, the $29 million net favorable impact resulting from the revenue recognition of certain Medi-Cal payments received in prior periods; and second, an unfavorable impact from a $3-per-treatment increase in dialysis and lab segment G&A, which was caused by normal seasonal increases in G&A spending at the end of the year and intentional nonrecurring project investment in IT during the quarter. It is worth noting that despite the higher G&A spend in the quarter, G&A per treatment was down nearly 9% in 2014 compared to the year before. International losses were $16 million for the quarter and $42 million for the year, in line with prior guidance. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be similar to those in 2014. For the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $98 million in the fourth quarter. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $42 million was approximately $5 million higher than our normalized run rate due to recognition of the Medi-Cal deferred revenue I discussed earlier. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners of 33.3% in the quarter was lower due to : one, a reduction in our tax reserves; and two, the incorporation of federal and state tax credits that were retroactively enacted by Congress in December 2014. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. I would also like to provide a few reminders as you model the normal seasonality for the first quarter of 2015 in our business. In Kidney Care, first, Q1 2015 contains 3 fewer treatment days than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenue and higher fixed costs per treatment. Second, our payroll tax cuts reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. And third, Q1 will not benefit from the Medi-Cal revenue that was recognized in the fourth quarter. At HCP, operating income fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 operating income tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average. Also, the severity of a flu season can have a material impact on medical costs. We are seeing higher utilization right now with the flu vaccine being only 23% effective according to the CDC. However, it is still too early to know how the flu season will play out, but we estimate that it impacted our operating income by $2 million to $4 million in Q4 2014 versus the comparable period in 2013. Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $199 million in the fourth quarter and $1.728 billion for 2014, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the previously announced settlement with the government. This was within our guidance range. We expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, lower than 2014 but in line with our historical trends. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. Finally, some comments on capital deployment. We continue to have a very strong cash balance. We are in the fortunate position of having various opportunities where we could deploy our capital in each of our business lines. We are constantly reviewing our capital allocation to make sure that we sustain the long-term health of the organization and achieve appropriate after-tax cash returns on capital. We did not do any share repurchases in the fourth quarter nor have we done any to this point in 2015. We felt that it was prudent to wait until after next week's announcement about Medicare Advantage rates before making any large capital deployment decisions. As we have said before, we favor a situational approach to capital deployment, and we'll continue to review our options. And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I guess we'll start with Medicare Advantage. Kent, you discussed the fact that OI could be down at HCP next year despite what seems like a robust Medicare Advantage membership growth environment. I'm just trying to understand, what kind of rate would it take for OI to be down next year as kind of we think about next week's rate release for HCP? And then can you give us an update on where you are with the contracting initiatives to get plans to give you some offset here on the benefit side? Kent J. Thiry: Justin, on the rate front, I'm afraid there's not a simple answer because there's so many variables that they're playing with now. They're playing with coding intensity, they're playing with the benchmark rate, they're playing with the RAF coding, which we're particularly sensitive to because we have above-average RAF. They're playing with the Star system. And so there's 4, 5, 6 different levers that they are thinking about pulling. And of course, the economics are a result of that net number at the end. And so there's no magic sort of single line to draw and correlate it to 2016 outcomes. On the contracting front, we should have a better answer for you than we do. I know that we have picked up some significant incremental protection through the course of the year, but I can't translate it into sort of a percentage of the book of business or something like that. So why don't we just pledge Garry to have that for the next time around. I think it's been solid progress qualitatively, much better than where we were a year ago but not close to done yet. For example -- and Justin, just for example, the kind of thing, so one that we signed recently, for example, any benefit design changes we and the plan basically spit them 50/50 up or down. The cost or the benefit of doing them is shared, and so we're aligned in terms of our microeconomic incentives. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And just maybe a -- a way to follow-up on the rate side before I ask my other question is the -- I know there are a lot of moving parts, as you said, but they're all going to net out to something. So I'm not asking for a -- to be clear, I'm not asking for a -- all 6 components, Kent. I'm just thinking about a range. Are you saying like -- can you say if the ultimate outcome is you have it all together and it's minus 5%, that's what's going to drive OI -- that kind of rate would drive OI negative? Or is it minus high-single digits like you had in 2014? The 7% to 9% I think you said. Just trying to put a ballpark around when we see this rate, how should we think about it for the data? Kent J. Thiry: Okay. Very fair question to which we do not have a very fair answer. So why don't we take that under advisement. We've got Capital Markets in a couple of months. And by that time, we'll know what they've done across all those things and maybe going forward, we should always calculate that number. But I'm afraid right now spontaneously, cannot do that justice. I mean obviously our forecast is a product of a bottoms-up set of a mix of assumptions on every single one of those variables, but we don't have the magic sort of index number that you're talking about. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. My other was question was on the commercial mix. I'm just trying to get an idea, can you give us an update on where your commercial mix has trended through the year and kind of come out of 2014? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. It's with some little ups and downs. It's basically been flat for 3 years or so now, which is much better than what happened to it a couple of years before then. And we have hopes that if the economy continues to recover, that it will go up. But there's so much noise in the system now compared to before, with exchanges and narrow networks and everything else, that it's not as sort of linear a relationship as it used to be. But the answer to the narrow question you asked is it's been more or less flat for 12 quarters in a row. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And so these impacts, as we've gone in -- we're 1.5 months into the quarter now, I assume you're seeing some further changes from narrow networks and such. Is there anything that you've seen over the last 3 months, let's say, including mid-February, that would give you any increase in line of sight versus where you were when you gave the guidance in terms of mix deterioration that seem to be embedded in your guidance? Kent J. Thiry: Yes, I hear you. Good question. The short answer is no. There's been no material development. We continue to get our normal commercial rates on the exchanges, but we worry about competitors being willing to discount for exchanges, at which point, we would suffer from a reduction in our incremental growth rate. And I could go kind of down a checklist. But the answer to your question is that if you think about the 5 or 6 or 7 variables that affect mix and rate, there have been no material developments that represent any kind of discontinuity from before. Is that responsive? Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : That's absolutely responsive. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just really a follow up on that question there. I think the company is well known for outlining all the risks that are out there that appear reasonable but often times, you guys highlight things that don't actually come to happen, which is great to be aware of them. But at the same time -- just trying to really get to the point here of is there something specifically that you're seeing? Have you seen -- because it really takes 2 to tango in this case of someone has to accept the lower rate, some player has to be of the view that the business model that has historically served everyone is now upside down and now it makes sense to change it. And have you actually seen that happen in at least small instances that make you think that there's a bigger risk here? Or is this just, hey, it's a risk because we're seeing hospitals do it, but we haven't really seen any indication that's happening at all yet? Kent J. Thiry: Fair. I think the answer's a little bit in between. Have we seen any clear irrefutable evidence? No. Are there rumors of 1 or 2 of some consequence? Yes. So it's a bit of a tweener. But no, we cannot point to anything that we know of that would represent -- well, that's the answer to the question. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess that's fair because we do not know how the competitors are necessarily priced. But do you feel like you're getting a lot more pressure from the managed care side? Is that there [ph] -- you have changed dramatically and you're doing all you can to hold the line or has that not really even changed much? Kent J. Thiry: That's always been a pretty unvarnished fistfight and that continues. If anything, to some extent, in some cases, the conversations are less adversarial because we're bringing so much of their value to the table now with reducing hospitalization, reducing mortality and everything else that we're doing on the quality side. So you'd almost push it the other way. But then when you stare at the emergence of narrow networks, the emergence of ACOs, the emergence of exchanges, you look at all that stuff going on, you get -- you have to respect the fact that the architecture of the building is different. And to presume the same sort of outcome is just not prudent. But we are absolutely sticking to our commercial rates for exchange business. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And the data you gave about Albuquerque, I think you said 2,500 members going to 11,000. What was ABQ at when you bought them? Kent J. Thiry: 0. I mean they may have had some -- they certainly had some had Medicare fee-for-service [indiscernible]. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Well, I guess I'm just trying to think, I guess, where are we as far as them rebuilding the book of business or the revenue base? I guess you're right, it was more like fee-for-service even within the capitation. But where are you in rebuilding the revenue base that they had when you first bought them? Are we back to where they were? Or not there yet? How do you think about that? Kent J. Thiry: Why don't we check and get back to you within 10, 15 minutes on this call, Kevin. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just to clarify something you said about the growth in the legacy markets being up 7% year-over-year. Do you characterize legacy being Southern California, Nevada and Florida? Or do you -- now that you've had New Mexico and Arizona, are they legacy now? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. Good point. Legacy is those 3 and then you sort of have Phase I of new, which were those 2 that were done right on the time of the deal that had fairly tempestuous beginnings in Phoenix and Albuquerque, and then Phase II new, which is the 3 that I referred to. So that's -- just from a terminology point of view, that's what we're talking about, and so the growth rate was in those 3. And let me go back for a second and just be clear on something, that ABQ had some MA patients but was just treating them on a fee-for-service basis. We're now treating the 11,000 on a partial-risk basis. And then at some point in the future, we'll move to full risk as soon as our payer partner is ready. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And this is my last question. Obviously, you've gone through ABQ in kind of the fix there. Can you talk a little bit about Arizona? What went wrong and where we are in the progress of fixing that? Kent J. Thiry: All right. Say your question again, Kevin. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess -- historically talked about obviously New Mexico not going well. We've kind of covered a lot of what you've done there to fix that. I guess it sounds like Arizona has not gone as planned either. Can you just talk a little bit about what happened there and where we are in the progress of returning that to normalized profitability? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. Well, let me first just comment. In aggregate, we delivered what we said we would, I don't know, 6, 7 months ago, in that year-over-year there will be an improvement exceeding $25 million. So that's the aggregate net economic result as we committed to you. It would be -- and then specifically in Arizona, we worked out an arrangement whereby a couple unprofitable plan populations got pruned in a very significant way, reduced by about 65%, 70% of lives, which eliminated a huge amount of losses for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : I guess Kent, starting off with the subpoenas that were announced after the close. Can you give us some more information? It kind of really sounds like this might be about something else. Do you have any color for us? Kent J. Thiry: I can't really say anything other than our release said. It's literally all we know. So that's -- if I could read it to you, which, of course, would be terribly redundant, but we don't know anything else. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. See, last fall, I think it was November, Medicare held an ambulance open-door forum and dialysis patient transportation billing and coding was actually brought up on the call. I think there was confusion about the coding. So I'm wondering if they're trying to get information from you guys about that. Kent J. Thiry: Yes. There certainly was a lot of noise around transportation in general, and then including in the dialysis space. We've had very clear policies for our people on that front for a long time and do a very thorough job of reinforcing them all the time, and so we feel very good about that. And as you know, we don't do the transportation. We don't bill for the transportation, not our transportation. So what you're saying is all true. Nonetheless, we only know what we know and we'll have to keep you posted as things unfold. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Sure. Okay. Great. And then can you give us some updated thoughts on Medicare's continual shift to be value-based reimbursement models and how you're positioned? And kind of on top of that, we've seen you do a few deals over the last several months. You mentioned some on the call, but also the Camden Group acquired a small consulting business as well and wondering kind of what your view is in participating in the -- in Medicare's bundled payment for care improvement initiative and whether you think it has legs or not. Kent J. Thiry: Yes. We don't have any particular perspective on that program. So I won't waste your time with just saying some superficial pablum. Our Camden Group, which is for those of you who don't know, is a consulting firm, it does superb work. They have a number of clients who are participating in the program. And so we're watching and we'll continue to watch, but we're not, at this point, doing anything dramatic in that sphere. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Great. And then going back to some of Garry's comments. I think you mentioned you saw a $3 per treatment increase. I guess how much of that's recurring? And then can you just recap again the $29 million Medi-Cal prior period increase? Where did that come from? And that's all I have. Garry E. Menzel: So onto the first question. You may have to repeat the second question for me. The first question, as I pointed out in the per-treatment increase, some of it was -- we did intentional nonrecurring IT expenditures at the end of the year, and some of it were normal seasonal increases. We're not breaking out how much of that is recurring, but I think you can assume on a G&A perspective that the run rate that we have for the average of 2014 is likely to be the run rate that we will have in 2015. Kent J. Thiry: And on the second subject, I think you asked about the $29 million, is that right? Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Yes, yes, that's right. Kent J. Thiry: Yes. And what that is, is Medi-Cal, which is Medicaid in California, instituted significant cuts back a while ago. It became -- it was litigated and so in order to be appropriately conservative, prudent, we couldn't -- didn't want to realize that revenue. And recently, there were decisions which made it clear that the state would not claw back those dollars and hence, it was time to put them through the P&L. Is that correct, Jim? James K. Hilger: Yes. That's correct. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Maybe just to pick up on the -- on that IT cost. Could you talk a little bit more maybe in detail about what it was and how you think about whether -- when the decision becomes whether or not to capitalize the cost versus running it through the income statement? Garry E. Menzel: I don't think we're prepared at this point to highlight what the individual IT costs were, and we certainly haven't made any decisions on capitalizing versus running through the P&L. It depends, of course, on the nature of costs in terms of variable versus fixed. James K. Hilger: Yes, that's right, Gary. We follow GAAP from a capitalization standpoint and the project spend in the fourth quarter was just more of an expense in maintenance type IT as opposed to long-lived assets. It was just necessary spend that, for the most part, was not capitalizable. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then on the revenue per treatment, you had some nice pickup. I don't recall if you said what that was from, but could you give us maybe more detail on what the growth in revenue per treatment was? James K. Hilger: RPT, we call it RPT, revenue per treatment, that is principally -- the rise in the quarter was principally driven by the recognition of the previously discussed California Medi-Cal revenue. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. That makes perfect sense. And then maybe moving on to HCP. Kent, I think you said that at this point, the contracts are structured so that if, I guess, what happened last time, where the managed care providers didn't pass along much or any of the increases to the beneficiaries, you guys would not take a disproportionate share of that. Is that on 100% of the contracts at this point? Or that's on a portion of HCP's contracts? Kent J. Thiry: It's just a portion and then that's where I can see that I -- that we don't, around this table right now, know what the percentage is. And it tends to not be a monolithic number either because, while some of the contracts are now pure in that you're 50% aligned up and down, even-steven; other ones have much more complicated formulas or corridors and some have no protection. And so all I can say is we moved from no protection to having a decent subset of our contracts with some or good protection, alignment's almost a better word. But there's still a bunch that we -- where we are exposed. And it isn't that we suddenly wanted to reopen every single contract we had. First of all, from a capacity point of view, we couldn't do that. Second, you have some of our payers who don't want to do that and particularly, for 1 term of an entire contract. And so it's a bit of a process. So a little bit analogous to when we were starting to move to bundling in all sorts of our old Kidney Care contracts, that it took in the end 3 to 4 years for us to move from 0% to 10% that way to 70% to 80% that way, and I think we're on the same kind of journey. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So are we maybe halfway there? Or is there any way to kind of guess where we are in that process? Kent J. Thiry: I'm looking around and nobody is confident enough to throw out an estimate. So I think we'll just have to tell you at Capital Markets with whatever precision we think's appropriate. But right now it's not a matter of our not being willing to disclose, it's that none of us knows the number right around the table. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then you had said you incorrectly handicapped the potential changes to MA, and you mentioned a couple of the individual items. Is there any more detail you can give us? Was there one thing that was more than another? Or sort of what should we keep our eyes open for when the rates come out? Kent J. Thiry: Well, I think it's the whole package. I mean, any one of the levers can add up to significant money over time. So whether it's the acuity coding, also called the RAF scores, whether it's the benchmark rate, whether it's the coding intensity, whether it's adjusting the Star system that -- on the margin, that math gets to be pretty significant of profits pretty quickly, which is why we are very worried that 2016 could be well below 2015. And then the other point we wanted to make very clearly is that we did not handicap the dynamism around Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates correctly. And for that, I wanted to apologize and make very clear that I got it wrong. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then once the rates come out, how long will it take you guys to go through that? And when could we expect to get some visibility from you on what the impact might be? Kent J. Thiry: They'll come out with a preliminary rule on most, if not all, of those variables on February 20, and then a final on April 10. I think -- April 6, excuse me. So in between, there'll be a lot of drama. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. I guess in terms of DaVita giving us some kind of guidance or direction in terms of where the proposed rates came out, when might we hear that? Kent J. Thiry: Oh, for that, that will be at our Capital Markets on May 5. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Not to beat a dead horse, but maybe just staying with the topic here. I just want to understand, is there something that maybe shifted your view on the Medicare Advantage rates for 2016 in terms of industry chatter, consultants? The reason I'm asking, I guess, because the only really piece of hard information that we got in recent months, to my knowledge, is the trend -- preliminary trend factor, which as compared to a year ago when in December of 2013, it came out with very a worrisome number. This time around, it was actually slightly positive. So I'm just wondering, is it because of where we are in the calendar that you're raising the issue now or have there been things recently that have got you particularly concerned? Kent J. Thiry: I don't think there's any clean answer to that because obviously in staring at it, there's a million different dots to connect from the conversations we're having with people in D.C. and what other people are saying and what people like you say and all the rest. So there's no magical source of data that we have. We do have more susceptibility than others on the RAF coding front because we have an above-average RAF, because we have slightly older patients and we've had them for longer periods of time. And we're more disciplined in both collecting diagnoses as well as acting on them, which is why we have superb clinical outcomes. And so we're more sensitive on that score than others. But then there's the other 3, 4, 5 variables. And right now, our concern is that the administration may not realize how close they are to actually reducing the incentive for people to invest in Medicare Advantage, which has been the source of tremendous innovation, cost reduction and clinical improvements. In a lot of markets, it's estimated now that once you get MA penetration up into that 35%, 40% range, the ripple effect into affecting fee-for-service expenses is quite substantial. There's a guy speaking in D.C. today who's well respected, he talked about as much as a 9% spillover effect. And so we worry that they -- some of them may be trying to, if not kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs, cut off a leg. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And as you look at the -- I mean, you talked to this and you've made some progress on renegotiating some contracts. But do you think that there is some fundamental unfairness in the way that the rate pain comes down between the plans and what you're facing as a delegated provider group? And is that something that might actually make you think differently about being delegated versus going on your own with your own MA plan? Kent J. Thiry: Well, it's a very colorful question. I am sure that at some point in some markets, we will be a plan. And this is no different than what I said before. We prefer to work in alignment with existing plans and feel that's the best way to more quickly get to a good place for everyone, including the patient and the physician networks. But I predict with a high level of certainty that at some point, in some markets, we will be -- we'll be a plan. Did I answer enough of that or was there... Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, you did absolutely. And I just -- sorry, just one more follow-up, sticking with this theme, which is, where are your end markets? And there are -- this is happening in markets that you're not in, but major hospital systems that are forming their own plans. How are you working around that? Are you willing to subcontract with those plans versus that maybe shifting the landscape for you? I realize that's a very open question. So whatever color you can give on that would be great. Kent J. Thiry: No, no. Your intuition is exactly right. I would think as the years unfold, we're going to have some health systems as our partners. And whether it's their plan and we're a subcontractor or it's our plan and they're a subcontractor or it's both our plans and we're fully partnered, that's going to happen. And for a lot of the health systems that are starting to put a plan on the shelf, we're one of the phone numbers they call. Because once you do that, you really get pretty intense about actually managing the population. And so you're absolutely right. And that's why 18 months ago, we said one of the sort of R&D segments we're going to play with from the perspective of developing growth models was the health system segment, and that's why we're working with Centura. It's why we're talking to 1 or 2 others already right now. And we may very well, in some of those cases, be doing a plan with them or a subcontractor to their plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Dana Nentin in for Darren. As it relates to your outlook, I was wondering if you could confirm what, I guess, if at all, you're assuming on P&L investments as it relates to the HCP business as well as your international or ancillary businesses. Kent J. Thiry: On international, I believe our guidance is that 2015 will be about flat to 2014. What you have going on underneath that calm exterior is some nice profitability improvements in some countries offset by the increased expenses as we ramp up in Saudi Arabia, where we won that huge government contract for 5,000 patients. So that's the mathematical answer to that. As to the dollars we're investing in new capabilities in HCP, I do not know the number offhand. It is not a small number because we think the potential for creating long-term competitive advantage is quite substantial. Of course, there's an element of subjectivity. If you add someone in cybersecurity, does that count as new capability that's strategic or is it just a new recurring normal operating expense or is it something in between? So I don't -- for Capital Markets perhaps, we can put something on the table that will give you a sense of what is incremental expenses that are very much tied to creating new capabilities for the future as opposed to just supporting existing. And by the way, if I can just break in, Dana, that someone asked a while ago about ABQ revenues. And they're back to approximately 80% of their peak, which is a significant improvement from 2 years ago at the low. But back to you, Dana. Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, great. And then I guess just as it relates to a couple of your business segments. On the DaVita Rx business, can you update us on, I guess, the revenue in that business? Or maybe if you could size it in any way, like patients served? Kent J. Thiry: We, Dana, up to this point, have not disclosed Rx revenue. And so I will not make a spontaneous decision to change that policy, but we'll take it under consideration before Capital Markets. It has grown, we will say that. It's not -- it's a material amount of revenue. And what was the related question? Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : If you could size it in terms of maybe patients served? Kent J. Thiry: Let me see if I can get permission to share that. Let me put it on mute for 1 second. We're going to -- it's approximately 65,000 patients, and people are going to check and see how out of date I am or how far off I am, but that gives you a ballpark sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citi. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I just had a couple of questions. The first, just going back to kind of the conversation on commercial reimbursement. Now that EPO is bundled on the government side and I think largely bundled on the commercial side, the government is giving you 0 on rate. This modest -- is it fair to say that this modest growth in revenue per treatment is purely being driven by 1/3 of your revenue or so that's commercial revenue? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And so that seems to imply maybe your commercial rate growth is in the 2% range. Is that -- what did that look like a few years ago? Has that changed? Kent J. Thiry: Well, I can't -- Garry is too new to know the past, and I am not going to be able to confidently say what year-over-year increases were 3 or 4 years ago. If I had to guess, I would say on a net basis, probably higher than that by a bit. That would be my -- the odds of that statement is directionality true, probably 80%. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : All right. I know that drug reimbursement was a driver on overall commercial revenue per treatment historically, so you have to parse that out. Is the -- this comment though about the narrow network, is that creating some pressure on your out-of-network revenue? Is that an element of the discussion at all? Kent J. Thiry: Could you please repeat the question? Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes. Kind of your general comment on commercial rate pressure driven by some structural changes in the industry, and I think you mentioned narrow networks. And I just wondered, is there -- DaVita still have a material portion of out-of-network revenue. And if so, is that something that's being pressured by the narrow networks? Kent J. Thiry: Certainly, out-of-network business is always under pressure. I don't think we've ever disclosed our precise percentage. It is, in general, much lower today than it was before. And so I will probably leave it at that. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. Just 2 other quick ones. On the $33 million HCP operating income, I think historically -- I'm not sure if you did this last quarter. It seems I remember maybe the 2Q, but you had talked about what the new market losses were. Is there an update for that number that's embedded in the $33 million? Kent J. Thiry: Yes, I think we're trying to move away from some of that parsing. We did it because, at the time, it was necessary for you to have a fair picture of what was going on. And therefore, we did it. At this point, we think you've got a fair picture without us going into that kind of detail, which, a, can be misleading; and b, sometimes is counter to your interest in terms of how it affects those market dynamics. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Fair enough. Last question. I just want to confirm the $11 million foreign currency headwind is only in other comprehensive income and doesn't impact the reported EPS or the reported operating income or the international operating income loss. Is that correct? Jim Gustafson : Yes. There is some that ran through other income, which is the same line that interest income is in. And that was about $5 million for the year and about $2.5 million for the quarter of a headwind due to the strengthening dollar. The rest that you see runs through OCI. Operator : And our next question comes from Trevor Walton [ph] with Advocate Health Care [ph]. Unknown Attendee : Can you guys provide an update on the hemodiafiltration trial that was supposed to end in the fall? Jim Gustafson : Yes. We -- the hemodiafiltration trial is no longer going on. We stopped that, so we're not doing that anymore. Unknown Attendee : Does that mean results are not favorable? And you don't see use of the product in the future? Jim Gustafson : We did not see it promising and so, at this point, we decided to stop the trial. No details behind exactly why. Operator : And our next question comes from Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : A follow-up question on your ancillary services business. It sounds like from a prior question that much of the growth in recent years has come from DaVita Rx, which is performing quite nicely. Could you also give us an update potentially on the number of patients you have on an integrated care platform today? And really how you see that shaping up in the next few years? Kent J. Thiry: Yes. We don't break that out, and it's not to be difficult. But it really gets difficult to categorize, because you can have a pretty tiny pay-for-performance bonus and then define that as sort of a value-added managed care-type contract all the way to being globally capitated. And so I think from a strategic point of view, the number continues to grow and the sort of weighted average depth and robustness continues to grow. But not in a way that would affect your modeling one way or another, which is why we don't think there'll be any particular utility in us sort of arbitrarily defining what counts and what doesn't. So it's very nice progress. It helps with relationships. It's consistent with our mission. Someday, we hope that we can monetize our capability in a way that makes it worth talking about with you. But right now it's just not. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. An update to that. Could you give us an update on anything that is potentially going on with the ESCO program? Or is that just completely on ice right now? Kent J. Thiry: I think -- I'm going to say words that one should never say. I think it's going to go into effect soon and that's just because I was in D.C. recently. And so I think it's going to go in soon. We are participating out of a sense of citizenship. It's not at scalable program as currently defined. However, we totally applaud CMS for doing all the work to get it where it is, and in particular Dr. Conway and others. And hopefully, we can use this as a platform to take that next step to a scalable program, which will really transform kidney care in America, dramatically improve quality, save a bunch of money, be good for shareholders, be great for families, keep people at work. So we're getting -- we're inching towards the promised land. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. That sounds very intriguing. Just one follow-up question. It's looked like from the initial proposals that an entity of your size can maybe end up something in the ballpark of 6,000, 7,000 patients. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Kent J. Thiry: It's been so long since we submitted the details, to be honest, I don't remember. Those numbers could be about right. Remember, CMS gets to pick which proposals for which markets, and it's sometimes difficult to forecast then even within one of those selections exactly what the enrollment's going to be. But that maybe -- it's certainly not that we're going to have 20,000 patients and it's not that we're going to have 1,000. I mean we could have 0 if they don't award anything to us. So we'd be surprised and disappointed at that. So it's not 25 and it's not 1,000, but beyond that, I don't really remember. I think where CMS was is that, in total, they wanted to have about 15,000 patients in the pilot. Now they may have gotten more aggressive on that, but that used to be the number. And if you assume that if we're 35% of the patients in America, we'd be 35% of the ESCO patients, that would put us right about exactly where you were estimating. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schaper with William Blair. Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : It's actually Margaret Kaczor in for Scott. Kent, you had mentioned at the beginning of the call that you guys were really going to invest into 4 main areas for HCP : the ICPs, the JVs, et cetera. Which of those to date and going forward do you think will have the best ROI? Which one will have kind of fastest growth in MA patients? And if you were a betting man, which you're probably not, which of the 4 horses would you want to really grow the most on a 5- or 10-year basis? Kent J. Thiry: Okay. Well, I'll first give a qualitative answer. They will all develop slower than you would like. But then separate from that, if we compare the medical group segment to the health system segment to the payer segment to the IPA segment, the one that we're, by virtue of our DNA, most compatible with and attracted to is the medical group segment. I mean we're a physician caregiver organization and so medical groups are like finding cousins or long-lost brothers or sisters for us as opposed to the other categories. And so I think that's the one that we're sort of philosophically drawn to. But as to which one will end up being the best vehicle for good risk-adjusted return on equity, it's just too soon to tell. If you forced me to bet right now, even though I'm not a betting man, I would go medical groups. Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then just one more for me. Anything that you guys are seeing due to some of the weather the East Coast is getting? Are you seeing people maybe miss some of the dialysis appointments, anything on HCP? Kent J. Thiry: On the weather, in general, our teammates do amazing things to help their patients get dialyzed. And I mean amazing in terms of picking them up, in terms of clearing out parking lots when there's no public services to do it, working early, working late, helping babysit for each other's kids so somebody can stay late. I mean it is inspiring to see what our people do. As a result, almost always, almost everyone gets their treatments. Does anybody around the table know anything different this time? Jim Gustafson : I think no. And we do all always see a few -- a higher number of mistreatments every winter. And it just depends on where the storms are and stuff, but there is a little seasonal impact every winter. Kent J. Thiry: We just had -- there were floods in Malaysia. And so we had people that were sleeping and sitting on their roofs because the water filled their houses, and our teammates continued to travel by boat to a stranded dialysis center to dialyze, with at least one caregiver being apart from their family for 7 days straight to make sure that patients got to the center then back in a boat, back to their home. So it gives you some sense of what they do. Operator : And at this time, I show no further questions. Kent J. Thiry: Okay. Well, thank you, all, very much for your consideration. We will do the best we can and look forward to seeing many of you at Capital Markets. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jim Gustafson. Thank you. You may now begin. Jim Gustafson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Vince, and welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will disclose some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jim. Solid results in Q4 for both Kidney Care and HCP. We'll start by discussing our clinical outcomes first, as we always do. 176,000 dialysis patients in America, about 35% of the patients in America; 98% with a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater; 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access. And we'd like to talk a little bit about our VillageHealth metrics, where we're at the cutting-edge of integrated care for these kidney care patients, with numbers like the hospitalization rate 26% better than the U.S. ESRD average; our readmission rate 31% better than the U.S. ESRD average; and as low as 5% catheter rates; and our special needs plans, less than half are already industry-leading companywide rate and 70% better than the U.S. ESRD average. These are wonderfully exciting numbers of incredible clinical and economic benefits for society, cannot be scaled until we have a new government program, and we are hopeful in that regard, and then continue to work collaboratively with the government to try to move us there. On the clinical side with respect to healthcare patients and our 830,000 patients there for whom we provide true population health management care individual-by-individual, but also across the entire population, if you look at 2014 HEDIS clinical metrics, California, our largest legacy market, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and we were four or five star across all MA patients on eight of the nine HEDIS metrics that are directly applicable to providers. So the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners compared very favorably to national averages, which means healthier patients, higher patient satisfaction, and savings to taxpayers. But now back to those solid results. In Kidney Care, that translated into $409 million NOI, and HealthCare Partners $72 million. Jim Hilger will elaborate on the Kidney Care numbers, but I'll just provide a couple of highlights. The biggest good news is that our commercial mix and our rates, both went up a bit. The biggest bad news is that our NAG, our non-acquired growth, went down. The commercial mix number is particularly significant in that it shows that up to this point at least, exchanges are not hurting us as we continue to hold our commercial prices constant for this commercial segment in our mind. And one reason we're able to do that is because more and more payers are paying more and more attention to the total value proposition, which is to say our ability to reduce hospital rates, to reduce cost of care in other areas continues to grow as a factor in determining the prices for the core treatment itself. Now on to HealthCare Partners, solid performance. But there were some one-time favorable and unfavorable items, so you shouldn't actually take the $72 million as the normalized number. Better to think of it as normalized at about $65 million, which is in line with our annual guidance after some of those one-time puts and takes. On the business development front in HealthCare Partners, we are getting better. We have actually added full-time folks in the last few months, the first time since we did the deal. We are not satisfied yet, but we're getting to be pretty darn competitive. We're in some high potential conversations, and our status as the leading independent medical group in America is one that puts us in incredibly good position for some of the high-quality conversations we're having. Separate from thinking about potential transactions, we are sitting at an MA lives numbers that is 8.3% higher than the same time last year. So very nice growth stream underneath those numbers. Moving on to guidance for the balance of 2015 or for the total of 2015 depending on how you want to look at it, our enterprise guidance is now $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. What this means is we raised the bottom end of Kidney Care guidance by $25 million. It's consisting of Kidney Care being $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and HCP being $225 million to $275 million. If I were to step back for a moment and just comment on our outlook, we have two strong business positions, both enjoying some steady unit growth, each with reasonably stable economics, although there is always some to-ing and fro-ing, and we are investing significantly for our future in improving our value proposition in ways that others will matter. And then specifically with request to HealthCare Partners, we're continuing to make very good progress in creating a highly differentiated physician experience, a highly differentiated patient experience, and more of a growth capability outside of the historical markets. I'll now turn it over to Jim Hilger. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Kent. Starting with Kidney Care, our Kidney Care operating profits increased $38 million sequentially, driven primarily by three main positive factors : number one, higher number of treatment days in the quarter; number two, improved revenue per treatment due to improved commercial mix and commercial rates; and three, lower payroll taxes. These positive factors were partially offset by higher dialysis pharmaceutical expenses, driven by higher average unit costs in the quarter and increased losses in our strategic initiatives in the international business. Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.7% normalized in the quarter. This was the lowest in quite some time. While there was no single cause for this decline in our NAG, some of the reasons include higher mistreatments during the flu season earlier in the year and efforts to improve the profitability of our acute business. This has put \u2013 we have been putting a tighter screen on our new and existing relationships, and in some cases, exiting some hospital relationships where rates were too low to be sustainable. As an example, we recently lost a hospital chain acute service contract to a competitor, because we were not willing to accept the low rates the hospitals offered. These efforts have improved acute revenue per treatment and OI, but have had an adverse impact on our growth. Now moving to G&A, G&A in our dialysis business was down from Q1 by about $2 per treatment, driven by seasonal declines in payroll taxes and the more treatment days in the quarter, and also higher-levels of legal and consulting spend that occurred in the first quarter. Please note that due to this higher legal spend in the first half of the year, we anticipate dialysis G&A per treatment to be slightly above last year's levels. International losses were $15 million in the quarter, which includes an asset impairment of $4 million. Including this non-cash charge, we now expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million. Moving now to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $104 million in the second quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to non-controlling interests was $37 million. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the second quarter was 39.2%, after excluding the $8 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the Vainer settlement. We expect the full-year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, again excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. And during the quarter, we repurchased $14 million in stock, but none subsequent to our last earnings announcement. Turning to cash flow, we continue to generate strong cash flows. Our operating cash flow was $335 million in the second quarter, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the Vainer settlement. And we now expect our 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion, again excluding the Vainer settlement. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below the range. And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Your line is now open. Steve C. Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, yes, this is Steve Baxter filling in for Kevin. I wanted to ask about the proposed managed care consolidation. I wanted to \u2013 the plans have largely talked about this enabling them to drive a shift towards value-based payment models. Do you think this could help move markets that are traditionally more fee-for-service kind of down the value chain? And I guess, how do you think about this as impacting HCP down the line? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we hope what they're saying is true. But directionally, we think this kind of additional consolidation of market share is an unambiguous negative. Hopefully for us, because of where we sit with respect to our value proposition on both sides of the house, we can make some lemons out of \u2013 make some lemonade out of the lemon. But we worry a lot about what that combination or those combinations can mean for network adequacy and access for consumers as well as rates for consumers. So we have a lot of concern and we'll do the best we can. And hopefully there will be some opportunities created, particularly for us. Steve C. Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That makes sense. I definitely see how you could perceive it as a negative on the dialysis side, but do you see it that way for HCP as well? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. In general, that kind of increased consolidation just leads to more market pricing power and leveraging rate power, which often then if successful doesn't flow through to the consumer, because of the market pricing power. So we hope that it will create market-specific opportunities for us, because we think some of those folks do want to move to a more value-based world. But the dominant, the dominant directional effect is one that is scary both from the rate to consumer side and the leverage over provider side. Steve C. Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Lieberman. Your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. You'd mentioned that I guess the pharmaceutical costs being up in the quarter were one reason that impacted profitability. I guess going back to the Investor Day, you had made some fairly vocal comments in terms of I guess what your thoughts were in terms of pricing for Epogen as new competition came to the market. Fresenius discussed moving a number of patients to Mircera. And so I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on where you thought the pricing was headed and if you had any conversations that maybe you could share with us? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There haven't been any significant developments since the last call, Gary. We still have our hopes for how competitive market forces will unfold in that sphere. But there's been nothing noteworthy that's actually happened yet nor did we expect anything noteworthy to happen within this timeframe. But I don't know if Jim or LeAnne would want to add anything. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : No, I think that's pretty much it, Gary. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So I guess the assumption that we should be working under would be that you would need to sort of see perhaps Hospira's drug come to market before there is enough of a dynamic in the market to bring down pricing? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well certainly, I think my response would just be pretty generic. The more people that come to market, the better, and we'll do everything we can to encourage it as will other people. And at the same time, of course, we have a lot of respect for the clinical efficacy of what we use right now. But certainly the more the merrier, the sooner the better. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then to follow up on the comments about the lost hospital business and I guess some competition on price, can you give us any more color on that? Was that a large national player that competed on price or a local provider? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : On the spectrum, it was a lot closer to the large size than the small size. And it was a significant account and it went for a price that we would not agree to, and it wasn't that difficult a decision. So it's just important that shareholders know that there is some of those pressures out there, and so you can worry about them at the same time that we are. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Should we be more worried about them? I mean do you see that increasing or do you sort of see this as an aberration? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Don't know. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, all right. Thanks very much. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, Garry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor, your line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Couple of questions from me. First, as we think about the non-acquired dialysis patient growth as we go over the next several quarters, is that 3.7% treatment growth similar to the patient growth? And then in terms of the lower growth, how can we attribute it between two buckets you had mentioned, the higher mistreatments versus the lower increase in the acute business? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me handle the second one first. We're not breaking it out, because it's just a single quarter and there is a fair amount of noise in the data, and so both factors are material. And there's some other stuff that play as well, only we didn't want to break it into four pieces, five pieces, six pieces. And so I think for the quarter, at least we'll just keep it at letting you know what a couple of the bigger drivers were, and that's as much as we can say now, and in each case, that effect may continue. As to the outlook going forward, we hope we can do better than how we did this quarter, but right now we can't guarantee that. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, you guys had mentioned that the commercial mix had increased. As we look at your guidance, what do you include in terms of the commercial mix? Are you expecting that to continue to increase as we go on throughout the year or stay pretty stable with where you are today? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Unfortunately on that one, it's another answer, we don't know. Certainly there has been a nice trend now for a number of months, that's comforting. But we watch each and every month, their earliest minute we can to see what happened to that number. And at this point, we're not willing to predict that it's going to keep going up, but we sure hope so. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. But you're not assuming that it continues to go up in the guidance that you've got it out right now, your operating income? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think in this case, our operating income guidance, we had never specified exactly what we were presuming on commercial mix. And we're not changing whatever we had in there. So there is no change to our guidance driven by what's happened with mix. And then probably the right way to think about it is the movements we've had on mix to be either consistent with whatever forecast we had or move this up within the range of guidance that we have. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And I hate to sneak one more in, but if I could, Kent now that you've got HCP, and then you guys have kind of gotten your hands wet in different models. You're increasing the biz dev group, expanding the business. What have you guys learned in terms of what deals are more or less accretive versus kind of the initial expectations when you had acquired HCP? And is there a model in which you've narrowed in on that's maybe more beneficial for you guys to pursue more aggressively? Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : A very fair question. I think what we like most is investing in growth, in our legacy markets. And that's consistent with what we said we would like a couple of years ago and we continue to like that, that's through organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions and things like that. Second, we really like buying quality medical groups. We're partnering in some serious capacity with major medical groups, like we did in Colorado Springs, and as we are in a few conversations as we speak. So that's probably our second favorite option for growth. And then, third and finally, we still have a lot of excitement around our payer joint venture in Philadelphia with IBC. And for those in general, and for our health system partnerships as we have with Centura in Colorado, but we continue to emphasize that, that is R&D, these are new types of arrangements and will take some time to emerge. So we're positive on them. But at this point, if we had to rank the kind of risk-adjusted, timing-adjusted attractiveness of different segments of growth, we'd put good old legacy markets and partnering with major medical groups at the top. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich. Your line is open. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey, Kent, thanks for taking the question. I jumped on late, so I apologize if I missed some of this. I just wanted to talk ESCOs, If you've covered it already, I can go back and check the transcript. But what's your thought \u2013 we've heard ESCOs being delayed. Is that something that you guys have considered? And I guess, what's your thoughts going forward with that program? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : On ESCOs, a couple of things. Number one, they haven't started yet. Number two, we don't know when they will start. Number three, we're working very collaboratively with CMS to get the design buttoned up. And the good news is, we and a lot of other people in the community and a growing number of people in CMS are quite positive. But to go any further than that would just be speculating and not a good use of your time. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we don't have any further questions on queue. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I will go ahead and add one other comment, operator. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name at the top of the call. But I may have been a little bit off in one of my comments a moment ago. We're not quite expansive enough that we had provided guidance previously at our total treatment growth would be in the 4.5% to 6% range, and we're still comfortable with that expectation. Operator, are there other questions? Operator : Yes sir. We have another question from Mr. Gary Lieberman. Your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the follow-up. Didn't want you guys to get off that easy. Just wanted to maybe go back to some of your comments on HCP and the growth and kind of what you're seeing and what your expectations are for additional deals you might do this year? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I'm sorry, I may have been talking over you at the beginning telling you that we're going to get revenge for your provoking the question period, but prolonging it. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I look forward to that. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But on HCP, we were in some high-potential promising conversations. Having said that, none of them are going to close quickly. If we succeed, it will be a very exciting beginning of our next chapter. But it's not going to happen in the next couple of months. And so I think there's nothing dramatic we can say about what will close or not close this year. All I can say is we are very substantively engaged with some groups that we really like. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Clive. Your line is open. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. Just a question on your VillageHealth program. You started your prepared remarks with some interesting statistics on that. Could you remind us how many patients you have within VillageHealth? And I'm assuming the vast majority or almost all of them are Medicare Advantage. Could you give us some idea of what proportion of your total Medicare Advantage patient population are currently going through VillageHealth? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The definition of VillageHealth that we're using now is a broad one, which is to say the number of patients where there's some form of value-based payment. And so using that broad definition, which in its most extreme form is global capitation, and we have a nice chunk of that both in the Kidney Care side and on the HealthCare Partners side. And then down to having some kind of performance bonuses, shared savings arrangements with individual payers or health systems. And so that total number of patients where we're in some form of value-based payment is about 20,000. So it's significantly higher than what it was a few years ago. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: And is that \u2013 yeah, because I remember, I mean the last time I looked at the numbers, I thought it was more like 9,000. Is that largely because you've included those categories where it's not a sort of full capitation model and so could we assume that half of that 20,000, they're sort of less than full capitation? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, more than half. The, I don't know if we've disclosed the amount of globally capitated ESRD patients we have, but it's probably in the neighborhood of 1,800 or so, which is probably significantly more than anyone else, but that gives you a sense of the mix. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Lisa. Operator : At this time we don't have any questions on the queue. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry operator, what did you say? Operator : At this time, we don't have any further questions on queue, sir. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We'll hold for about 10 seconds or so just to give folks a chance. This is perhaps the most uneventful quarterly call we've had in 16 years. And so we will work hard to hopefully make the next one just as uneventful and hopefully positive for everyone involved. Thank you very much for your interest in DaVita. Operator, are there any other ones? Operator : No questions on queue, sir. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. So that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. And now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Jim Gustafson. Sir, you may begin. Jim Gustafson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Cindy, and welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners' Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'll start with our forward-looking disclosure statement. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for your interest in our enterprise. In the third quarter, we had solid \u2013 strong results in both Kidney Care and HCP. But as always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first, as that is what comes first, we are first and foremost a caregiver company. We have about 177,000 patients in the U.S. now, and that's about 35% of the total dialysis patients. 97% of those patients had a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater; 73% of those patients have fistulas placed for their access for the second year in a row, DaVita is the clinical leader in the CMS Five-Star ratings system. 46% of our centers are Four-Star or Five-Star rated compared to 23% for all other providers, truly noteworthy. HealthCare Partners, we continue to take care of over 800,000 patients on a globally capitated basis and several hundred thousand others on a fee-for-service basis. To give you another snippet of clinical information from HealthCare Partners using the 2014 HEDIS results, in Florida, one of our three legacy markets, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and we are Four-Star to Five-Star across all MA patients on all nine HEDIS metrics, that is outstanding. If you stare at these and other numbers, you see that the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HCP compare very favorably to national averages, healthier patients, healthier patient satisfaction, savings to taxpayers, that's the result. Onto operating performance. On the HCP side, $83 million NOI, that number is a bit misleading in that it includes the net benefit of $22 million from the recognition of some risk-sharing settlement that we do not expect to recur, that was real money that we earned, but it shouldn't have been centralized or concentrated in this particular quarter, but certainly very good news and even independent of that, a solid operating quarter. The big news on the HCP side, as many of you already know, is the announced combination of DaVita HealthCare Partners with the Everett Clinic. The Everett Clinic is one of the most respected, multi-specialty practices in America with a strong primary care focus, more than 350 physicians currently and we and they believe there is wonderful potential for highly robust growth in their market in the years to come. Already they take care of over 300,000 patients, that's mostly fee-for-service today, but there is especially strong interest in that geography by all parties to work with it and moving further down the value versus volume spectrum, we look to close in early 2016 and we're awfully excited. The balance of the business pipeline is strong, I'll leave it at that unless people want to talk during Q&A. On the Kidney Care side, operating income on the other hand was adversely impacted \u2013 affected by a non-recurring incident, $23 million reserve for refunds related to prior reimbursements received by our DaVita RX pharmacy business. So, we had a $22 million non-recurring pickup on one side, a $23 million non-recurring hit on the other side. So the net is the quarter is the quarter, but it's got those puts and takes. Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.5%, usually I don't cover that, I'm covering it this time because it was the lowest in some time, a lot of different causes, just discuss a few of them, we've referred to some hospital contracting changes as of the last quarter or two, that continues to impact our numbers. We're also experiencing significant delays in some states where we are more concentrated than others. Due to delays in state certification and other regulatory issues, we have nearly doubled the number of de novos awaiting certification compared to the same time last year. And in addition, so far this year, we're not picking up any tailwind in terms of treatment growth from decreasing mortality. Nonetheless, we still expect total treatment growth over the intermediate term to remain between 4.5% and 6% as we have previously discussed at our Capital Markets Day, although we could be a bit below this year. And we expect non-acquired growth to remain between 3% and 4.5%, although the near term is likely to be at the lower end of that. Overall, 2015 guidance \u2013 enterprise guidance is now $1.87 billion to $1.915 billion. In Kidney Care, we are raising the guidance just slightly, operating income from $1.63 billion to $1.655 billion now. In HCP, we are tightening the range, operating income expectation of $240 million to $260 million. We're not giving quantitative 2016 guidance at this time, we'll be doing that \u2013 that type of 2016 guidance on the Q4 call, but we do want to provide some directional guidance for both HealthCare Partners and for Kidney Care. On the HCP side, we have two definite earnings headwinds and one potential earnings headwind. Number one is a definitive headwind in the form of reimbursement cuts. And these have been previously discussed for the most part a net $50 million hit in MA reimbursement because of the completion of the 100% move to the new HCC model, which has been previously disclosed and that number discussed. In addition, we expect about $20 million in Medicaid cuts as the State of California adjusts for the data on the Medicaid expansion population that came in earlier in the program and them settling that out at this time. The second earnings headwind is actually, we intend to make good news for the long term, which is some significant infrastructure and next-generation investments on the HCP side. We're at the point now where we can execute in these kinds of strategic moves with more confidence. The biggest chunk of that is on the IT and technology side, everything from improving the point-of-care information for our delivery system, significantly improving the depth and breadth of our mobile applications, significantly enhancing our website presence and features both for internal use and external use, and when we talk about external, we're talking about IPA physicians, we're talking about brokers, we're talking about patients, significant improvement in our data mining capability, in our clinical data warehouse, improvements in patient scheduling, things like that. The second largest area of increased investment will be in compliance legal. The \u2013 one of the other large ones is in increased physician recruiting as our growth potential continues to unfold, but the general title is a lot of infrastructure and next-generation investment. Now, one would reasonably want to ask for a lot of rigorous discussion of any such investment, and at our Capital Markets Day, we will provide just that, and we intend to do Capital Markets in the first half of the year. The third headwind is the potential headwind, which is the potential of the non-renewal of a payer contract due to the fact that right now, the rate offer is unacceptable. We hope it doesn't happen as it will cause significant patient and employer disruption, but it could, but that's a potential. Now the good news to weigh against those two real headwinds for next year and the one potential headwind for next year is our expectation of continued strong performance in our legacy markets. If you look over the last three years, the growth in our MA population in those legacy markets has been 15% on a CAGR basis. And if you eliminate the MA rate reductions on the RAF model side, on the HCC model side, then the CAGR of EBITDA growth in the last few years is approximately 4% or so. So, without those headwinds, we would be looking at some more favorable numbers. Nevertheless, when you put all that together, the net is that 2016 OI in HCP is likely to be lower than 2015, stepping back from that one year fact, our investment thesis still stands. We have a strong and substantial foundation where we are good at doing at scale what others want to be good at and we are working hard to enhance the team and value proposition as we move forward. On the dialysis front, I think we can be quite concise that it would be a year with the typical puts and takes in terms of upsides and downsides, if not for the fact that our Medicare reimbursement will be near-flat, and that's just a difficult headwind to overcome on that side as so many of you know. A few words on capital deployment, from an enterprise perspective, perhaps three points : point number one, in the quarter, we did significant capital deployment with substantial acquisitions in both U.S. Kidney care and HealthCare Partners, and we also did significant share repurchases as our earnings press release reflected; The second point is, we still have a healthy cash balance and continue to generate strong cash flows; and the third and final point is that we look forward continuing to deploy that cash over the next several quarters in the same way that we deployed that capital in this past quarter, evaluating the relative opportunities on an ongoing basis. Now, I hand it over to Jim Hilger, our Chief Financial Officer, who will walk through some more details and some of the numbers. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Kent. Starting with Kidney Care, operating profits increased $17 million sequentially. This includes the increase in refund reserves recorded in Q3 at DaVita Rx. This improvement is driven primarily as a result of two main positive factors : one, an additional treatment day in the third quarter; and two, solid cost management of both patient care costs and G&A expense, with each down over $1 per treatment in the quarter as compared to Q2. International losses were $15 million in the quarter and this is consistent with the last quarter. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million. Now, on to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the third quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to non-controlling interests was $46 million. We expect non-controlling interests to be slightly lower in Q4. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the third quarter was 40.5%. We expect the full-year tax rate for 2015 to be in a range of 39% to 40%, excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. Also, we purchased $341 million of our common stock in the third quarter, which brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $425 million and 5.6 million shares. As you think about modeling the fourth quarter, here's a few things to keep in mind : Q4 is typically the weakest OI quarter of the year for HCP, and dialysis G&A tends to increase in the fourth quarter. Both of these are factored into our full 2015 operating income guidance. Now, turning to cash flow, we continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $679 million in the quarter. We now expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. This range excludes the approximately $300 million after-tax impact of the Vainer settlement. Please note that the strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from the 2016 operating cash flows due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Yes. I'm sorry. I was on mute. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Mr. Kevin Ellich. You may begin. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey Kent, just wanted to start off, could you talk a little bit about \u2013 you named a bunch of headwinds? And also, the $22 million of risk sharing settlement for HCP. Just wondering if you'd give us a bit more color on that, how we should think about that if that is (0:15:35) kind of a one-time item? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. When you \u2013 you're referring to the $22 million positive pickup? Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Yes. That's right. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Jim, why don't you go ahead and cover that? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah, Kevin that amount is \u2013 did occur \u2013 let me start over. That amount covers multiple periods, not just all in this quarter and it was out of trend. That's why we call it out. I wouldn't expect the same level of impact in future periods. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It was a positive development in large part, after a whole lot of back and forth between us and their payer, where the payer agreed that we actually deserved additional revenues and settled up in one fell swoop. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. And then, I know you guys have the non-acquired treatment growth has been a little bit lower and you called out a number of things, Kent. How long do you think this will persist and when do you think we'll see normalized growth kind of back in the 4% to 4.5% range? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's the right question, Kevin, and I'm unfortunately going to disappoint you in the answer, which is, it's not clear. We know, as we've continued to prune our hospital portfolio, that we'll put that behind us and then the year-over-year comparisons will start to be different than the way they look right now. But the certification and regulatory delays are very hard to predict and particularly in places like California where we have a lot of centers and a lot of centers waiting to be built and/or certified and/or occupied, where we're really getting hurt. And if we were more adept in this area in terms of predicting, we would have told you ahead of time that it was going to happen, and clearly, we didn't tell you ahead of time. And then on the mortality front, we've done so well over the last four years, five years, six years in a row, and this plateauing was not something we expected. And so, we, at the same time or in the same way, are not good at saying what's going to happen over the next year to that trajectory. So in two out of the three that I mentioned and then there's a few other drivers that just aren't worth going into, but as you can see, in two out of the three that I did mention, we just don't have the ability to predict, unfortunately. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks a lot. Next question please, operator. Operator : Yes. Our next question is coming from Mr. Matt Borsch. Your line is open. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Just directionally, it seems that you would still be pointing to the Kidney Care side having positive operating income growth for 2016. Can you comment on that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We actually are not commenting on that and we only wanted to comment on HCP because we felt there might be a growing gap in the perception what was likely to happen because you couldn't have insight into how aggressive we intend to be in terms of infrastructure investments and next-generation investment, reflecting a real bullishness on how differentiated we could be a few years downstream. And so because of that, we said, gee, there is no reason to wait because we know we're going to do it. It's not dependent on any intervening development. And we know we're going to have to do a lot of explaining and we're eager to do that explaining. But absent that, we just felt it's not appropriate to go into further quantify guidance at this time. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Let me back off if I could and just ask a high-level question. As we think about the HCP model and certainly I think there's a very compelling case that the physician-led delegated model is \u2013 has historically and will continue to outperform the hospital-centric model. But if you look at the markets where, in essence, you're competing with the hospitals for the hearts and minds of physicians, do you think what the hospitals are doing, I'm sure it varies by system, but is it real here or in most cases, we really haven't gotten into real risk taking in a lot of these markets? It's upside-only bonuses and window dressing and bells and whistles around HCOs. I just want to get your sense of your assessment of the hospital systems and what they're really doing on integration. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me grope around here for a minute and then we can see where you want to take it, Matt. First of all, not surprisingly, the answer differs a lot by institution, that some are far more committed, far more adept, have been working on it for far longer, allocate more talent and capital. And those entities are doing some real stuff, real population health management, really bending the cost curve. That is a small minority of the overall pool. A lot of other folks are acquiring practices and recruiting doctors, where \u2013 with 85% of the motivation being to just secure their referral flow. And they are not making the tough decisions and tough investments associated with actually getting very good at that. And so for us, however, in either case, we look at it with a fresh set of eyes. Some hospitals and health systems are becoming great partners to us. And we will work with them to succeed in both population health management and fee-for-service at the same time. In other cases, we are in fact competing with hospitals as they speak to move down the path or just try to gain control of their referral flows. So for us, whether health system is really committed and getting good at it or actually not committed is independent of our decision of who is friend or foe, and sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. No, that's great. I'll get out of the queue. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. You're welcome back as always. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Your line is open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks. Can you just explain a little more what the pharmacy item was? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : It's just a case where we had built for some items and we got paid for them. And as part of our normal compliance reviews, we uncovered that. We should not have been paid for them or paid the wrong amount, I'm not going to know all the details. And so, we went back in time, identified all those instances, and in some cases, I think going back four years, five years and maybe payments to the government. But because we did it in one fell swoop across three different issues going back in time, it added up to a pretty significant number, and so we felt we better carve that out and let you know. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I guess when you gave the guidance on HCP, you didn't mention there is a tailwind to deal \u2013 that you guys have been pretty active on the deal time to \u2013 you've obviously been ramping up some de novo starts. And I guess there was some thought that Arizona and New Mexico would start to look better next year. So just wanted to see directionally, are those things not going to be contributing into next year or how do we think about that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Very fair question. And the problem with the business model is A), right now, some of these assets are expensive, because so many people would like to have them as their partner; and B), in many instances, they one \u2013 step one is actually to add expense to start building the capability and start negotiating the contracts that are going to lead to the incremental value and the incremental profit. But it means you're adding expense before you're adding revenue with positive contribution margins, and it takes time to get some of the contracts and execute. So, while a number of those different investments we've made are right on plan, those plans are not going to contribute any significant incremental profit in 2016. And in cases like the Everett Clinic, which has a long track record of strong operating performance, nonetheless the growth opportunity is so substantial, we are eager with them to invest, to go pursue that growth opportunity. But in the short term, that means a bunch of expense. So, we understand that it's our responsibility to delineate this with good conceptual and analytical rigor at the Capital Markets Day. In the meantime, the net number is nothing to get excited about from a short-term profit point of view. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I guess, that makes sense. What about the Arizona and New Mexico, I thought those were kind of on a multi-year kind of a rebuild? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think our policy is not to go through every individual market on every call. What I can tell you is that if you look at our sort of portfolio of new markets and joint ventures, some which are two-years-old, some are one-year-old, some are six-months-old, that the 2016 versus 2015 results in aggregate are going to be about the same, and that's a mix of \u2013 of some moving into profitability, some moving into bigger losses and everything in between. But the portfolio is basically a non-story in terms of helping or hurting 2016 versus 2015. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess maybe last question. If the CMS reg was finalized, I just wondered (0:26:13) your interpretation of the provisioning there to kind of include drugs more quickly into the bundled rate. I think there's been some hope that as EPO goes generic, there can be notably a period of time where you guys benefit from the lower cost drug for a while, it seemed like what TLS was trying to do is trying to narrow that window. And so, I just want to understand your interpretation of that, and then also, if in fact Amgen waits a while to match, and one of the drug that's currently out there starts to get used a little bit, is that going to put you \u2013 is that a headwind potentially into 2017, I guess? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me turn that one over to LeAnne. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Yeah. Well there was a couple of questions in there. So let me adjust restate what CMS is doing. One, they have categories which they have identified for when a drug or a service would be new, and so how that would come into the bundle. And number two, as you're specifically referencing, I think, the introduction of IV Sensipar, they have accepted the industry's recommendation that that product be outside of the bundle for a transition period, which time that they will be to able to establish the cost and clinical efficacy, et cetera of that product, and then as they suggest that that period be a minimum of two year. After such period, both that product as well as the oral equivalent will come into the bundled payment system. They don't go through much more detail than that or a little bit more detail, but I'm sure we look forward to working with them over the next couple of years through the detail implementation. I'm not sure if that answers your question, but if you want to be more specific, I can certainly provide a little more data. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, that's definitely helpful. I guess the generic biosimilar, could a biosimilar EPO gets thrown into that same... LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Yeah. So, in the first \u2013 in my first statement, they have identified categories where a new entrant would just come in under existing payment. So yes, the biosimilars, we would expect, would be under the bundled payment system when the FDA approval is complete. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And they're just going to \u2013 weighted average for the use of those drugs versus the average to come up with what the new rate for that drug will be? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Yeah. So, remember, for the ESRD payment system, there is no particular quote rate for any single component of the bundle, but it's the bundled payment system. I haven't thought through for you how non-ESRD clinics would be reimbursed for a product like that. I can give it some thought and certainly get back to you. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. Okay. No, that's helpful. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mr. Gary Lieberman. Your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question on the HCP expenses for the infrastructure and investments. The way you were speaking, it sounds like most of that's going to be expensed. Is there some portion that would be capitalized or are you still trying to figure out how much of that would get capitalized versus the expense? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Some will be capitalized, but not a big percentage. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And so I guess excluding the sort of some of those upfront investments, you didn't say specifically, but sort of insinuated that operating income would be positive without that? Is that a fair statement? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Well, let's see. What I did say was that because of the expected headwinds, netting against the organic growth, et cetera, that we expect OI to be down. I actually \u2013 trying to do all the math in my head, without the investments, I can't answer your question spontaneously. But in aggregate, given the two definitive headwinds and the one potential headwind and given our current sense of organic growth, et cetera, that we expect the net to be unfortunately one that leads OI to be down 2016 versus 2015, so I realize I just restated what I said earlier, but I think I just have to leave it at that. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe on that, the third potential headwind, is there any more detail you could throw us on that, is that a large contract, is that somewhere that you've had issues before? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that would be not in our shareholders' best interest to go into any more detail on an active negotiation. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe turning towards the Kidney Care business and just getting an update on, to the extent that that you can give it on your ESA strategy, specifically I guess the 10% of the drug that you could use non \u2013 not of EPO based under the current contract, are you doing any of that or you're thinking of doing any of that? And then also maybe comment on, it sounds like Amgen is trying to move some customers to \u2013 onto Aranesp to see if you are doing that or what your thoughts are around that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : LeAnne, do you want to go ahead and take that please. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Can you repeat your question please, sorry? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sure. The \u2013 first part of it was, is sort of just an update on your ESA strategy and specifically... LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Yes. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : ...the 10% of your contract that you're allowed to use outside of Epogen? And then the second piece of it was, any comments or thoughts or anything that you're doing regarding Amgen's apparent move to try to get someone dialysis operators to move to Aranesp as opposed to Epogen? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Yeah. Sure. We do intend to do a pilot on the long-lasting Micera (0:32:32) agent in 2016, and certainly we do have availability with that 10% to try both a long-lasting agent as well as one other biosimilar for Epogen that would come in and we certainly will consider both options. As for Amgen-specific actions with respect to moving the industry to Aranesp, clearly that seems in some way for them to be competing with the steroids, the long-lasting agent and making sure that they have an opportunity for the marketplace to test our product. We are not presently doing anything significant with Aranesp. Does that answer your question? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. I think that answers my question. And then, excuse me, really just a follow-up on that, (0:32:24) any questions \u2013 not any questions, any thoughts or comments on the FDA's letter on Retacrit. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : No, just we've seen what's in the public marketplace the same issue and we wish them the best if they answer the questions with the FDA. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Margaret Kaczor. Ma'am, your line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I know you guys don't want to talk about specific kind of partnerships. But you've seen (0:34:01) you've seen (0:34:02) running at a $500 million run-rate. And just broadly speaking, as we go out until year three, year four, and year five, what should we think of top-line growth rate as well as the profitability profile? And then just to follow up on that, as we think of other partnerships that you guys are doing, are you expecting a more similar profitability and top-line growth rate? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we are not in the practice of giving that kind of market-by-market guidance. And even if we were, we would hesitate because there is so much uncertainty in exactly how it will unfold. And we, as you know, ramped up from nothing to $500 million, imputed top line in a very short time, and as (0:35:00) going in the markets to the range of outcome over the next year or two is quite wide. And so, we're excited about it and we have a high-quality partnership with the big-positioned IPA and with IVC. But to go any further would just not be prudent. There's just two wide a range of outcomes. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And in terms of kind of the NAG growth, I know you touched on the impact of acute care contracts and maybe those patients coming in. But can you give us any kind of clarity in terms of what the chronic non-acquired treatment growth was in the quarter? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll have to turn to my partner here, I don't know if it's a number we've disclosed before or not. We have not done that in the past, but we'll let us reflect on it, given our NAG is down and that's one of the reasons it's a very fair question. So let us reflect and maybe starting next quarter, we'll put it out. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I'll sneak one more in if I could. In terms of kind of the delays \u2013 the regulatory delays in opening some clinics, do you expect that to move into different states as well? Are you prepared for that? And is it just you guys that are maybe seeing some of these delays or competitors as well? Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We think everybody is experiencing the same delays on that front. However, we have a significantly higher percentage of our de novas in some of the states that are the slowest right now, California being prominent among them. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Margaret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. (0:36:43). Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Good afternoon. With regard to Everett, you commented that it serves mostly a fee-for-service population, and that you hope going forward, it becomes more of a value-based enterprise. How do we move from sort of the fee-for-service model today to where you want to be in the future? And is that primarily going to come in the Medicare Advantage space or commercial partnered with hospitals, or how do we think about the conversion there? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Got it; three points. Point number one, we think good multi-specialty groups can make significant contribution margins in a fee-for-service world, as Everett Clinic and others have demonstrated. So, we never want to confuse profitability as being only the result of having globally capitated contracts that \u2013 it's our premise that exactly the opposite is true, especially, when we start partnering with a group and they have more access to capital to do some of the things that are quite leveraged even in a fee-for-service world. Second, that the \u2013 one of the powerful levers to pull to enhance the value proposition and profitability of a major medical group is actually to sign some global risk contracts and begin to invest in eliminating waste from this system and improving health. And then third, there's all sorts of less dramatic value-based contracting that can go on in between, whether it's shared savings and bonus plans and new market incentives and combined ancillaries, and so that the menu of intermediary steps that can be taken with plans in a market, or with a health system or with other medical groups is quite long. And so, with the Everett Clinic, we're excited because our five-year strategy encompasses accomplished all three of those fulcrums. Unknown Speaker : Got it. And then just a follow-up on HCP and you sort of touched on this generally. But investors, I would say, have been patient with sort of the business and profitability trends. And I think a lot of people were optimistic that 2016 would sort of be the inflection year, where things generally start to turn for the better. Clearly, some of the things that are going on next year are true business sort of things that will come up, other \u2013 some of it's going to be discretionary. I guess, what would you say to people that \u2013 when should we really start to thinking about an inflection in the investments in the patients really begins to pay off for the shareholders? And I'll leave at that. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that's the X-hundred million dollar question. And right now, we just can't give a date where that happens, although we certainly respect the fact that patients can run thin, and it's part of why we look forward so much to the upcoming Capital Markets session, where we can spend a significant block of time going through this with more analytical rigor. I would remind folks that absent the change in the RAF model, which certainly we've mis-handicapped, but absent the change in the RAF model, we would all be sitting here quite content with our margins and returns and their trajectory. Now, that just so happens to be a major issue. And not to be ignored, and government policy can continue to change although that model of course is 100% implemented in the MA program has an awful lot of political support in terms of supporting the benchmark rate. But we do want to make sure people continue to parse through the impact of that single MA model change from the performance of the legacy market \u2013 from the performance of the new market. And at Capital Markets, we'll attempt to do a real good job of parsing through those different components. And so, you can assess whether your patients should be sustained or jettisoned. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thanks a lot. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Gary Taylor. Your line is open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry. Hi. Good evening, a couple housekeeping items first, I want to make sure I have correct. The refund of the pharmacy payments in the ESRD segment, that was a revenue item? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Yes. That reduced revenue. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And the new revised guidance for consolidated company on operating income, the $1.870 billion to $1.915 billion, that is versus the $1.421 billion nine-month figure or is that nine-month figure actually being adjusted in some way? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : People are reflecting and staring at pieces of paper, Gary. So, can you go on your next question and... Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...I'll come back to you later. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. On that, I guess I'm getting to kind of \u2013 I'm trying to understand just the implied fourth quarter operating income, which I think is $449 million to $494 million, which tied to again kind of your comment sequentially, but I just want to make sure I'm apples-to-apples there? And... James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Gary. Yeah. You said that the year-to-date $1.421 billion, that's correct. Yeah. That'd be non-GAAP adjusted. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And revenue per treatment in Dallas has been stronger year-to-date than we thought, I know in the last couple of calls, you've talked about commercial mix being kind of a surprising positive trend factor. Obviously, that number was stable sequentially, so it couldn't have done \u2013 it couldn't have done much, maybe the growth year-over-year narrowed a little bit. So is that the right conclusion, commercial mix kind of holding stable with that \u2013 that year-over-year improvement, Kent? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Of the two dynamics, one is mixed, and of course, even small increments and decrements can move the dial. And I'm trying to remember at what level we were around on the numbers that you've seen. But if it's a full percentage point, which is my memory, then... Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I think it's right. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...there can be a significant movement within that. And then, second, as you know as well as any of us, that we're always winning and losing some battles on the payer front in terms of rate negotiation. And right now, we're having a few more victories than defeat in that realm, and so some of that \u2013 that's \u2013 some of that is contributing. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Last question, just trying to understand a little bit, going to the ATP segment, capitated number of months down \u2013 no actually pure enrollment, I think down about 18,500 or a couple of 2% sequentially and down a little bit year-over-year. I know you call out in your text legacy markets and for months (0:44:43) approximately flat. So will this include \u2013 you've intentionally dropped some membership in some of the newer markets or is that the right conclusion? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We do have one of the new markets where we very intentionally dropped a plan that led to a significant drop in membership, and that was a good thing for our P&L and for our strategic position. Now, having said that, I'm not sure that explains exactly what you're bringing up, so let me look around the room here. Yeah, Gary, yeah, that is the explanation. It was very conscious and negotiated and has significantly enhanced our P&L. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Erito (0:45:38).Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : I just wanted to follow up on the HCP questions. I think the keyword was patients, and we've been in your stock for a couple of years on in-patient. Is there any way we could get some outlook prior to the Analyst Day in May? Certainly, you guys have made a decision to budget higher expenses. I'd just like to get an idea of what type of return you're looking for to get on those expenses and not have to wait until April or May of next year? Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We will think about it. We are contemplating moving the Capital Markets up relative to last year. And in addition, we're going to give the actual quantitative guidance after Q4. So, I think you'll have two good bites of the apple of getting more information and being able to test it relatively soon. Am I answering the question, or am I missing it? Unknown Speaker : No, I think you got it. That's fine. And the other questions, kind of addressed it, so I won't belabor the point. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, thanks everyone for your consideration of DaVita. And we will do the best we can in the intervening months until we talk again. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

(Broker) Ryan Newman - Promus Capital Operator : Welcome to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the discussion, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And now, I'll turn the call over to your host. Mr. Jim Gustafson. Thank you. You may begin. Jim Gustafson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Vin, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer; Vijay Kotte, our CFO for HealthCare Partners; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start by noting that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in these statements. Further details concerning the risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings included in our most recent annual report and subsequent quarterly reports. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and disclaim any duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all. This will be a pretty high density call, and I'll be covering more topics than normal because of some of the nuances contained therein. As usual, I will first talk about our clinical outcomes because that is what comes first. Second, for each major business unit I'll talk about the operating performance for the quarter, year, and provide some thoughts on 2016. Third, we'll then step back on each business briefly and on the enterprise overall to try to set the table for our Capital Markets Day coming up on May 18 in New York City. And then lastly, I'll talk about enterprise capital allocation. So let's launch right in since there's quite a bit to cover. On the clinical outcome front, excellent news once again. Kidney Care, 97% of our patients with a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access. At our recently final results announced for the CMS QIP program for another year period, once again we outperformed the rest of the community with only 1.4% of our facilities facing a penalty compared to 7.1% for the rest of the industry. Of course, no quality rating system is perfect, but in rating test after rating test, we come out as clinically differentiated. On the HCP front, equally promising results. With respect to HEDIS clinical metrics, we'll just pick Nevada this time. We try to move it around for you geographically. And in terms of subject matter, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and had four-star or five-star across all MA patients on all nine HEDIS metrics. So in both cases, both main sides of the house, our outcomes compare very favorably to national averages. This is good for patients. This is good for the taxpayer. Now, let's move on to the quarter and the year. We'll hit HCP first, international second, Kidney Care third. HCP operating performance for the quarter, $25 million, that excluded the estimated write-down. This was within our guidance range. On a normalized basis, this was actually about $37 million if you normalize for prior-period adjustments, et cetera, which actually is about exactly the same amount of profit in Q4 of 2014 normalized. For the full year OI improved, as you know, from $215 million to $240 million, which is also within our guidance, although at the low end. In order to achieve that, the legacy markets were up a bit, the new markets were up a bit, and the combination of those bits was more than enough to make up for the medical cost inflation and some very substantial investments in capability building/G&A. And Vijay Kotte, our new HCP CFO will discuss those investments and capabilities in G&A in more detail in just a few minutes. But I will say (04:48) move right on to 2016 guidance for HCP. It is $175 million to $225 million. There are three primary drivers of that range. Driver number one, $58 million in reimbursement cuts. This is primarily the result of the new acuity coding RAF model being implemented, the final chunk of the way, a 100% implemented as of that time. As previously discussed, the HCP was more comprehensive in its coding capture. Complete diagnosis of patient conditions is a good thing, but it also left the entity far more vulnerable to any coding reimbursement compression. So $58 million from that source, most of it the model and the model is now 100% in. Second big driver of that range is our investment in additional capabilities. There's two components to this $60 million year-over-year increase. Component A is really remedial. Their prior business leadership essentially stopped investing in the company, it was working to maximize profitability for the sale either knowingly or unknowingly. And as a side note, just want to remind you that we knew that. That is why we only paid a six times multiple in a world where other allegedly comparable assets were then going for nine times to 10 times and now much greater than 10 times in the market. And the second component of that big G&A capability investment is offensive, meaning investments that we think are going to create significant competitive advantage for us over time. The third primary driver is the positive one, which offsets a big chunk of those two negative ones. Solid operating performance, good old solid operating performance. So if you look at the math, you have a $58 million hit from essentially the completion of the RAF model. You have a $60 million hit from the increased investment in G&A, half remedial, half offensive. That would equal a $118 million hit. You then have a $78 million operating performance improvement which offsets all but $40 million of the two negative trends, and that yields the change from the $240 million in 2015 OI to the midpoint of the guidance $200 million for 2016. We can of course take questions on all of that but those are the three primary drivers. 2017 does look better than 2016, the model will be behind us. We continue to make steady progress on our capabilities and our contracting. If we put the P&L aside for a moment and look at cash flow and take as a scenario the midpoint of our guidance, in other words the $200 million for HCP, and simultaneously take the midpoint of our guidance for the total enterprise, that $200 million would equal 11% of total enterprise operating income. However, HCP operating cash flow is projected to be over $400 million, about 25% of total enterprise operating cash flow. This happens because of what we've talked about in the past, low working capital intensity, low CapEx requirements, and a $100 million per year hard dollar cash tax benefit. If we step back for a moment and look back at three difficult years, the total reimbursement cut from the implementation of the new RAF model for us, $165 million. What we had anticipated was a much smaller number than that, in fact less than half, so about $100 million of incremental P&L harm that we had not expected is due to that single variable, $100 million. Now, the fact that it came from that does not make it any less painful than if it came from anything else, but the important message is it did not come from operating problems or operating issues. Looking forward instead of backward, we have six primary markets; California, Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, or more particular the Seattle area. In those primary markets we have six leading independent medical groups. It is in those places plus our joint venture, Tandigm in Philadelphia, of course, but that is a horse of a different color, that is where we'll be placing most of our emphasis in the near and perhaps intermediate term. Prices are very high right now for valuable properties. Our bandwidth is pretty stretched given how much we've grown and given how much opportunity we have in those six markets plus with Tandigm. And then third, we need to prove to you that we can get the right returns and margins in a number of those places before we do too many other significant things. Because of all that, it is unlikely we will do any other big Everett like deals, unless it is through a capital like transaction or is for a very attractive multiple. Other good news to take into account and looking forward instead of backward, I'll list a few of them each of a different type. First, our legacy markets in 2015 once again outgrew their markets in terms of MA growth. The markets grew 6%, we grew 9%. Number two, we've dramatically improved patient service metrics since the time of the transaction. Number three, we've had a number of significant IT advances that have improved our support for our front line physicians. We have a long journey there and Vijay will talk about that a little more but we've got some nice early momentum and victories in better supporting our front line physicians. Number four, we've had a number of forecasting and fire period adjustment issues. You know that painful truth as we do. Our finance leadership team is literally 90% new. And fifth, and finally in this case, if you look at our top 22 executives, we have five great veterans with immense amounts of valuable HCP experience, and 17 new executives that we think are the right people to help take us into that next chapter going forward. So that's it on HCP for now, although Vijay will come back and talk about some of those capability and G&A investments a little bit later. So to move on to international, we underperformed in 2015, $55 million in losses compared to original $40 million of guidance. But why? Well, we had a $5 million AR reserve, which almost entirely came from one country where there were two fiscal intermediaries that became insolvent. We actually hope to get a bunch of that money back. We also are $10 million behind plan or were $10 million behind plan in two countries where we built new centers and patient growth was behind plan. In 2016 for international, our guidance is losses of approximately $40 million. This assumes no unusual AR reserves. We are experiencing payment delays with the Saudi government. So that's a washout, but we have done nothing on that front now, we still expect to receive all of the funds. And the good news is, the Ministry of Health in Saudi is explicitly very happy with our service, and very impressed by the patient feedback they have received. Their words, not ours. In 2017, we anticipate improvement over 2016 on an OI basis, and in 2018 in international dialysis in our current country portfolio we expect to achieve breakeven. We are, in fact, already in 2015 or we did already in 2015 generate positive aggregate EBITDA at the clinic level in eight out of our 10 countries as we continue to grow and cover our G&A. And another reference point that gives you a sense of the per country scale, in 2014 we had an average of $10 million revenue per country. 2015, an increase of 50%, up to $15 million per country. 2016, if we hit our plan will be $27 million in revenue per country. So you can see that at reasonable margins we are making strong progress in covering the fixed nut of global G&A. Finally, most of our growth internationally has been through acquisition. Virtually every one of those acquisitions has been competed for with others. And so these are market valuable assets that real competition wanted to have, and our competitors continue to invest in growing internationally as well because of the returns they see. Now, stepping back for a moment with respect to international, we are still very bullish on the long-term opportunity both in Kidney Care and other HealthCare services. Now, on to the Kidney Care operating performance. Once again, strong quarter, strong year. Operating income, $449 million, and then for the year $1.658 billion. First number was for the quarter, of course, once again excluding some non-recurring stuff. Jim Hilger will provide more detail on the numbers. I'll go right into guidance. We anticipate in 2016 another solid year, $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion. Of course, there's always risk, we'll fall short and there's always hope that we will exceed. This guidance, per our normal customs, does include the international economics, and it also includes the unfortunate fact of flat Medicare reimbursement for the third straight year. The uncertainty in our 2016 performance, as in many recent years, centers on revenue and revenue per treatment. We anticipate our performance in the first half of the year with respect to RPT to be positive, but we have a lot less visibility into the second half of the year, hence the broadness of the range. And regarding the strategic initiatives, there could be some earnings volatility there. One reason is ESCOs, as you know, we have launched, and so we incur those costs, particularly those extra start-up costs now, and we get the shared savings payment later if we perform and the data is correct. And the second variable are some Rx, DaVita Rx renewals. All of this of course is incorporated into our guidance. Stepping back now with respect to Kidney Care and looking out three years, four years, five years, there's one big downside and three attractive upsides. The big downside is what will happen to private pay. It is unfortunate that we have a large cost shift in our dialysis industry in America with private patients paying a lot more to subsidize the 80% to 90% of our patients that are Medicare and Medicaid. And when you put that on top of payor consolidation, distributed risk pools, exchanges and other things going on, it would not be prudent to not be nervous about what will happen with private pay. On the other hand we do have three upsides; one is in the ESA market. For the long term, as many of you know, we spend about $800 million per year on ESAs. We are intensely looking for the right long-term partner or partners and hope to consummate some type of long-term partnership well before the expiration of our current contract at the end of 2018. Second, integrated Kidney Care. We are very competent at this. Regardless of who has the risk, we think we will be one of the sub-contractors of choice. And third, finally, the flat Medicare reimbursement is scheduled to go away at the end of 2018. In 2019 we hope to be back to our normal market basket. All-in-all, our strategic position in U.S. Kidney Care is strong. Now, let's step back to the enterprise overall. The guidance; OI of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion; OCF, $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. But on an equally important topic, how are we thinking about capital allocation at the enterprise level? Well, first with Kidney Care, we stay the course, and since there aren't a lot of large properties available out there, that means they will not use all the cash they generate. HCP, they will focus on existing markets unless something that is capital-light or at a very attractive multiple comes along. International, we will continue to invest to grow. Putting all three of those together, what does our capital allocation look like if you pick something arbitrary like the next three-year period? We will generate in a reasonable scenario \u2013 with of course downside risk and upside hope, but in a reasonable scenario, we will generate operating cash flow of approximately $5.5 billion in the next three years. If you count normal use, meaning our current operating plans, business plans, et cetera, which of course could change, we will use about $3.5 billion for those purposes. This leaves about $2 billion on the side for us to contemplate what to do with, with of course your counsel as well, as we compare other growth opportunities to debt repayment opportunities to share repurchase opportunities. Now, Vijay Kotte, our new CFO of HealthCare Partners will walk through a few more details. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Thanks, Kent. I'll take a few minutes to provide more detail into the investments we're making into the future. As Kent stated before, we are continuing to make both remedial and offensive investments into the business. The best way to look at these items is to put 2015 and 2016 together. When you do that, we have a total of approximately $80 million in incremental investments over 2014. To provide more context into these investments, I'll put them into three primary buckets. First, we have information technology; second, legal and compliance; and, third, next generation capability and change match. In the bucket of IT, we plan to spend $40 million more in 2016 than we did in 2014. This includes the following areas. First, security; second, applications to support population health; third, a community portal to enhance communication between patients and providers; an enterprise data warehouse; our accounting system conversion; and a national IT infrastructure to enable our creation of one company. Next, in the legal and compliance bucket, we will invest an additional $10 million to $15 million over 2014. In our final bucket, we're investing approximately $18 million into research and development related to next generation care management capability, a team we call Catalyst, with applications to our current markets as well as others. Now, Jim Hilger, our CFO, will walk you through a few more details on the numbers in the quarter. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Vijay. First, I'd like to point out a couple of non-GAAP items in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an estimated accrual of $23 million for potential damages and liabilities in our DaVita Rx pharmacy business. We have excluded these numbers from our reported non-GAAP income from continuing operations. A few words about this estimated accrual. The reserves relate to the period from 2010 through 2015. As a part of our normal process, last spring, we initiated an internal compliance review of DaVita Rx, during which we identified potential billing and operational issues. We notified the government in September of 2015 that we were conducting this review of DaVita Rx and began providing regular updates of our review. Upon completion of our review, we filed a self-disclosure with the OIG on February 5, 2016, and we have been working to address and update the practices we identified in the self-disclosure. In addition, as disclosed earlier today, on February 5, 2016, DaVita Rx received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office. The information requested has some overlap with the items we self-disclosed, and we do not know if the U.S. Attorney knew we are already in a process of developing a self-disclosure with the OIG. At HCP, we took an estimated $206 million impairment charge of non-cash goodwill in an intangible asset of certain HealthCare Partners' operating units. These impairments were driven primarily by underperformance of the business reporting units in recent quarters as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate those cuts. The final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. This non-cash charge will not impact go-forward performance or our cash taxes. On to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $103 million in the fourth quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to non-controlling interest was $40 million. Next, our effective tax rate for income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the fourth quarter was 36% and for the year was 38.2%. And we expect the full year tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 40% to 41%. We have also repurchased $151 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, and we also repurchased an additional $249 million in the month of January. As a result of these transactions, we now have approximately $259 million remaining under our current board authorization. As you think about modeling the first quarter, here are a few things that you should keep in mind. In our Dialysis business, Q1 2016 contains one fewer day than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenues and higher fixed costs for treatment. Second, our payroll tax caps reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of a $1 to $1.50 per treatment. At HCP, OI fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 tends to be a bit lighter than the full-year average. Now, turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $437 million in the fourth quarter and $1.861 billion for all of 2015 excluding the Vainer settlement. The strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from 2016 operating cash flow mostly due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. But despite that, we still expect 2016 operating cash flows to be $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, showing that we continue to generate strong cash flows. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, hi. Thank you. Could you maybe just address the areas of operating performance improvement that you're expecting in the HCP business? Maybe just \u2013 I don't know if there's any kind of granularity that you're prepared to give at this point, whether it's by geography or function. I'm just curious the types of things that you think are going to be going better this year versus last? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Matthew, this is Kent. Thanks for getting on the call. It's pretty broad-based. So there's nothing really that jumps out. There's no dramatic disparity in unit growth or margin enhancement, either through MLR improvement or G&A savings or revenue enhancement. So it's pretty mixed across the portfolio. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And let me ask on a different front still related to HCP. As you look at things that are potentially for sale and you mentioned prices are high, is that still principally because of the major hospital systems that are bidding up? Is it, I mean, more of the same hospitals? How much is hospitals? How much is managed care versus other? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's certainly health systems bid sometimes breathtaking amounts for these medical groups, but we have been surprised by some of the other players, including some of the health insurance entities and the offers that they have put on the table as well. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Kent, I guess just kind of big picture, thinking about the guidance, which historically you've had a track record of being conservative. But if you look over the last few years, we haven't seen much growth in operating income. I guess, clearly, there has been some issues with HealthCare Partners. But I guess, broadly speaking, what will it take to get growth reaccelerating? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : A very fair question, Kevin, and one that we are pretty intense about on the inside. On the Kidney Care front, with that flat Medicare reimbursement that's just a real problem that we've got to get addressed. And then, hopefully, through a new partner or the same partner in a new partnership with ESAs, or getting some integrated care runway, we can start to break out of the current trend. On the HCP side, of course, some of the declines have taken away the Kidney Care gains. And so if we just stop that and get back to a reasonable steady growth on HCP, that together with the normal growth in Kidney Care could start to generate some much more interesting numbers. And then, lastly, international is unfortunately just a couple of years away from being able to really help, although, once it starts helping it could be a long-term big deal. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. Okay. And then, going back to your comments on Kidney Care and the potential downside and three factors for potential upside. In the ESA component, you said that contract expires in 2018. Should we expect to see something happen in the next year or two years? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We would like to develop the right kind of long term win-win partnership sooner rather than later. We have the contract we have with Amgen and so if they don't want to do anything new with us, we certainly can't force them to. Having said that, there are other people that we can create agreements with that just wouldn't kick in until the day after the Amgen agreement expired. So our point is pretty simple that we think we can be a great partner for someone for the next five years to 10 years in that area and we're eager to find that party and start working towards that long-term future. Necessarily, even if we got very serious with someone tomorrow, these deals are pretty complicated and nothing would be signed for some time. But that's one of the reasons why we want to start working on them now because it takes a while to put them together. Is that responsive? Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): It is. And can you remind us, I think in the contract you had the ability for 10% of your ESA supply to come from someone else. Are you guys testing other options out right now? And if so, how's that going? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : LeAnne, you want to talk about that? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Certainly. We do plan to do some pilots over the next year. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Will you go with one source or will you try different options, LeAnne? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Certainly we'll try multiple options. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay, great. And then, I guess going to hammer, going to the share repurchase, you guys were very active in January. I think you said you have $259 million remaining. Should we expect to see continued share repurchase activity maybe get \u2013 are you guys going to go back to the board to get \u2013 to re-up the authorization? And even though you don't provide EPS guidance, is that part of your outlook for 2016? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll go ahead and take that one. We're going to apply the same sort of measured calculus we've always applied looking at the alternative deployments, looking at the different scenarios going forward, looking at interest rates, looking at the stock price. As the CEO, I'm feeling a little sheepish about the fact that we bought back quite a bit when the stock was a fair amount higher than it is today and we would have done more value for \u2013 created more value for our long-term shareholders by waiting a little bit as opposed to buying when we were at above historical average EBITDA multiples. So we bring our normal sort of intellectual calculus to it, but certainly we've demonstrated over the last year and certainly many of you were actively engaging and encouraging us too. Certainly, we've demonstrated, as we have at different times in our history, the willingness to going to the market and take some shares out of play. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking question. So on HCP guidance and the breakdown on different elements that are impacting the operating income. Specifically, I recall the company mentioned on the last call, Medicaid headwinds of $20 million. So should we assume that you no longer include that headwind or it's just small that you didn't disclose that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : What happened is we thought it would be Medicaid of $20 million, it turns out the Medicaid is $8 million. And so when we talked about $58 million, $50 million was that RAF model... Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, got it. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...in Medicare, $8 million was Medicaid. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That makes sense. So then I know you mentioned that those headwinds, you expect to be offset by a broad, I guess, based operating improvement. But are you willing to talk about the legacy market's performance in 2015? I don't know whether specific numbers are up or down, or the magnitude of the improvement. And then, what do you think this would be 2016 versus 2015? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. In 2015, our legacy markets contributed to the profit growth, the OI growth as did our new markets. So both were contributors to our ability to offset the bad stuff that happened in normal medical cost inflation and our big investments. In 2016, we anticipate the same that independent of the rate cuts, that both legacy markets and new markets will do better than they did in 2015. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just a follow up on your comment around the dialysis business, and the pricing, that you expect the pricing to be positive in first half, but there's less visibility for the second half of the year. So can you shed a little more light why you think that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's not because of any particular normal negotiation between us and the payor. It's just because of all the noise in the air with everything going on with exchanges, regulatory ambiguity in those areas, what some of the new payors are going to do in terms of getting in and out of exchanges. So there's just so much going on that we're uneasy, increasingly uneasy, and we thought we should share that. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So there's nothing specific to cause because I want to say you mentioned something around some specific contracts, or I guess maybe that was on the HCP side, so maybe that's irrelevant. And I guess that's all for me now. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. I think you might be referring to the DaVita RX renewals I referred to. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But that isn't independent point separate from what's going on in mainstream Kidney Care. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ms. Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. First of all, thanks for all the details in terms of where you guys are investing in HCP. So maybe a question on that. What impact should we expect these investments to have? I might assume it's better outcomes that are going to lead to these higher patient adds. But even more specifically, over what timeframe should we see the fruits of these investments, is it as early as 2017, or is it more 2018, 2019, 2020? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Margaret, we knew this question was going to come and dreaded it because it's going to be the answer you hate. It's not going to happen right away. For example, in technology space it'll take a year, one to two years to get a lot of that stuff done. And then the benefit it has does not immediately leap off the P&L. In terms of our next-gen care management and changed management group, that's got some near term upside. When you're managing $4 billion of medical cost, the spending that extra whatever it is, $20 million with some new talents, with some new analytics, and with some new approaches, you can get a pretty good payback on that pretty quickly. But the whole team is so new and the processes we're putting in place are so new that we would just hate to create expectations and then fail. We're very bullish on the impact they're going to have, but it just is not going to be overnight. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. So maybe to take that even further, and I'm sure you'll appreciate this question as well. You talked about profitability in HCP, maybe improving in 2017, and part of that is that the reimbursement cuts from the RAF model go away. And so that should be, if I'm thinking of it right, about a $60 million tailwind. But then are you going to increase investments further in 2017 to offset that? And then also the final bucket in terms of OI performance, should that improve in 2017 as Centura and Everett start to have a larger impact? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, you do know us well. The elimination of the RAF model that's been hanging over our heads, that's certainly the elimination of a headwind. It doesn't lead to a tailwind. It just leads to the absence of wind, which for us right now would feel pretty good assuming that benchmark rate increases would be, roughly speaking, equivalent to what goes on with medical cost inflation. And so we do want 2017 OI to be nicely higher than 2016 OI because of the elimination of those headwinds and a lot of the other stuff hopefully kicking in. But did I miss a part of your question? Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. So the operating performance of Centura and Everett, what kind of impact will they have in 2017 and 2018. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. On Everett, we would also expect 2017 to be better than 2016. 2016 has some integration expenses. 2016 has some adding talent to take on risk pools. So we have that expense. We have some additional amortization from the deal. We have some special additional expenses that exist for the first year or two years of the deal and then go away. And so we are counting on \u2013 we are expecting a nice operating income trajectory at Everett clinic in 2017 versus 2016, and 2018 versus 2017, and 2019 versus 2018. We have high hopes for the significant growth of the business there. And then on Centura, that is a tougher one. We certainly expect it to do better in 2017 than 2016. It really depends on if we get a quality of risk (41:07) contract, what the effective date is, and then how quickly we can make a difference. So that one could stretch out a little bit based on the timing of all that. We're making nice progress, but right now there's nothing locked and loaded. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just one more from me. You guys were nice enough to provide kind of the DeNovo clinics that were waiting for regulatory approval last quarter. How are those looking this quarter, and should we expect they're still could be a bolus of clinics that we'll see open in the first half of the year? Thank you. Patrick McKinnon - Vice President : Yeah. The DeNovo backlog is still about the same as what it was last quarter, but what we're seeing is a much better improvement in opening new clinics. So that's where we'll see improvement in the first half of the year. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And that person speaking is Patrick McKinnon, Chief Financial Officer of Kidney Care. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Margaret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Sticking with HCP for a second, is it possible to get some color on Albuquerque, maybe just how the recovery has gone on, and where it is today versus where it was, say, a year or two years ago? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Boy (42:28) Gary, this is Kent Thiry. I'll handle that. The difference between a year or two years ago is night and day. This is just huge orders of magnitude, better. So that's the high level answer. The operations have been stabilized. We're in very constructive risk pool conversations with one of the major payors. We're in healthy collaboration discussions with two other significant health systems. The leadership has been stabilized. The management team has been improved. So there hasn't been any \u2013 I mean, the numbers are certainly way better than two years, but I'm not wanting to represent this as we're on some stunningly steep trajectory of profit improvement, but all the fundamentals are better, and now we'll see what we can get done in the next couple of years. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then how much of your time are you spending on HCP versus on the Kidney Care business? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I spend significantly more time on HCP than on domestic Kidney Care. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe just talking about the self-disclosure and the CID both happening on the same day. Is that just coincidence, or is there something else that we could read into from that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's just totally coincidence. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then is there any additional color you could give us around it? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think so, Gary. We just don't know much yet. The good news is that through our own internal normal compliance processes we uncovered some issues, and we did the right thing in investigating them. We did the right thing in reporting to the government. We did the right thing in doing some refunds. All of these were small dollar issues, and transactions that were a tiny, tiny percentage of overall transactions. And we kept the OIG up-to-date along the way as to the work we were doing but not completed, and then we send off our formal self-disclosure document. And then it just so happened that very same day that we got the CID from the Department of Justice, and we have no idea if the Department of Justice had any idea that we were already nine months down the track with the OIG. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then I think you said your analysis went back to 2010, and it looks like their inquiry goes back to 2006. Is there anything to read into that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I guess, it would suggest, again, that the two things aren't at all linked because clearly they were coming up with their own set of issues and their own set of dates, but beyond that we don't know. As you know, in many instances once they decide to take a look, they often that first document is very, very broad because, why not? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on your comments regarding negotiating an ESA contract. It sounds like \u2013 you're talking about it more than I think you had in the past on new contract. Is there anything tangible you can share with us or any hope that it could get done in the near term? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No idea. This is \u2013 we are eager. I'll be redundant, but we are eager to have a long-term partner and a long-term plan, and we just think there's a lot of opportunity. But getting there we'll take either our current partner deciding they want to create the next generation together, or doing it with someone else, in which case the implementation of course would have to wait. But the reason we're talking about it more is people are getting more serious because it's just not that far away anymore, and $800 million a year and growing is a lot to play with. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then, I guess, maybe just last point on that. Is there anything that you can share with us or that you're aware of, of the one short term biosimilar that has been expected to come to market but has not yet? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I personally don't think it makes much sense for us to start talking about individual biosimilars and what exactly is going on. And so LeAnne, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to get out on the table. Anything I do would just be repeating publicly known information. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : No Kent, I think you answered that correctly. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks Gary. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. We're going to get the advanced notice for 2017 MA rates next week, and obviously I don't want to \u2013 it's hard for you guys to predict what's going to be in there. But one thing that's been kicked around is potentially adjusting the risk models to better code for duals. Do you have any thoughts on that, particularly if it was budget neutral, and if not, can you at least give us a sense for within the HCP pool of enrollment how many are duals? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Like you observed, we don't have any idea what they're going to do, and we do believe that currently in Medicare Advantage the sickest people we get under reimbursed for, and the healthiest people they over reimburse for. And for people like us, who are not insurance companies, and we want to keep the patients we have, we do keep them, we can't really determine which new ones come to us, the current reality works to our disadvantage. And then with respect to duals in particular, while we have a bunch, it's impossible to say whether we would benefit materially or not until you know whatever the heck they would do. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And then changing gears here, just with regard to the seamless payor organization rollout or pilot/fall, can you give us a sense for some initial feedback from patients, or just anything with regards to that would be helpful. Thanks a lot. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Is this regarding ESCOs? Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's just too soon. But we can tell you that we've been in a globally capitated pilot with CMS for seven years, eight years now, and it's pretty significant. There's 800 patients there or so. And then we have another 800, 900 globally capitated patients within our HealthCare Partners universe. And in general, and in particular on the Kidney Care side where the C-SNP plan, special needs plan, is focused just on these Kidney Care patients, it's spectacular. The patients get extra services. The doctors have extra support. The referring doctors get better information. The nurses get to provide coordinated care. The patient and family gets support at home. So I can tell you in our mature other where we're globally capitated, it's a spectacular, beautiful, transparent victory. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Kent, you've discussed in the past your desire to reengage in productive conversations with your Health Plan partners to ensure that your incentives are aligned with their incentives, and they treat you as a good partner with the MA rate cuts. And are there just any developments along the re-contracting front that would be of any interest to us? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, is the short answer. I'm not going to get the mix right, but if you ask on Capital Markets Day we'll have it. And Jim Rechtin is not here right now, but I'd say a healthy percentage of our renewals end up with a new agreement where our interests are much more aligned. And that's been true every year. It's a big shift from what existed before. And the same statement is true with respect to health systems in hospitals where a very solid percentage of our new contracts there create a lot more alignment than the old ones which were so zero-sum. So I would say, it's steady progress, nothing dramatic. But it's really healthy in reducing downside risk, and over the long-term will create some shared upside. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And just on Renal Ventures, I don't think I've heard an update. Just maybe I should know this, but just divestitures, FTC, and any sense for the contribution this year. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care, DaVita HealthCare Partners, Inc.: Hi. This is Javier Rodriguez, CEO of Kidney Care. There is no update. We're still anticipating a Q2 close. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And maybe one last one. It's just, any way to get a sense of the size of DaVita Rx now, either by patients or revenue? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Boy, I don't remember what our historical policy has been. It has certainly grown. It is making some money, it's not losing money anymore. And I'm going to have to turn to Jim Gustafson so I don't violate any policy. Go ahead, Jim. Jim Gustafson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. We disclosed we're serving in various capacities 165,000 patients, and that includes both internal and external. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Ryan Newman with Promus Capital. Your line is open. Ryan Newman - Promus Capital : Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. You spoke a little bit about the softness in some international markets, and how other players were attracted to those assets as well. As well, I know you've expanded a little bit in Colombia, in Portugal, China, Germany. Can you just talk a little bit about where the most softness occurred? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Where the most what has occurred? Ryan Newman - Promus Capital : Where the softness conditions existed internationally? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Softest conditions? Ryan Newman - Promus Capital : Yeah. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So soft as in... Ryan Newman - Promus Capital : The worst performance. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Poor performance? Okay. Thank you. Sorry for my... Ryan Newman - Promus Capital : No. I misworded the question. I apologize. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd say the softest performance from a profit point of view, I mean, my mind is racing as to how much I should disclose. Ryan Newman - Promus Capital : Sure. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We've had some profit problems in Colombia. That probably sticks out as one of the softest. In Saudi, we've been growing a little bit behind plan, but the microeconomics appear to be solid. And I think beyond that, I'd have to get into so many nuances. In China, we still put in the R&D category where we're very steadily consistently investing to look for the winning formula. And we don't have it yet, but we're not discouraged. We've got some stuff that's working there, and we have some stuff that's not working, and that's kind of the hit rate we expected. India, we know, is a long haul kind of thing, an immense market. But we're not ever going to start doing anything big there quickly because the microeconomics are just too tiny. So there's a little bit of flavor across three or four, and I'm probably giving Jim Gustafson a heart attack by providing all this. Ryan Newman - Promus Capital : Yeah. That's great. Thanks, guys, for the detail and I appreciate your time. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we no longer have further questions on queue. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the Capital Markets are May 18. Correct, Jim? Jim Gustafson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : In New York, we're going to nail down the location. There's a lot to talk about. We look forward to going into more detail. We're going to have a longer general session that we normally do so that we hopefully give you a very comprehensive and analytically thoughtful not only reiteration of our strategy but our progress and the right kind of leading indicators to stare at. So we're looking forward to a real high intensity extended exchange, and we'll do our best in between now and then to get through 2016, and start growing again in 2017. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. So that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Welcome and thank you all for standing by. At this time all participants will be in listen-only mode. Now, I'll turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Jim Gustafson. Sir, you may begin. Jim Gustafson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, JR, and welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners' First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita of Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of HealthCare Partners; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, I would like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all. In the quarter, we delivered solid operating income and strong cash flow. The total adjusted operating income, as you've seen in the release, $458 million, and the operating cash flows of $429 million. In the course of this call, before Q&A, we'll cover clinical outcomes; we'll talk about U.S. Kidney Care; we'll provide an international update, including talking a little about the deal announced today; we'll cover HealthCare Partners results, HealthCare Partners we now refer to as the DaVita Medical Group; and then we'll provide a few additional financial details. As to clinical outcomes, we'll discuss them first, as we always do, because that is what comes first. We are, first and foremost, a care-giving company. And the Kidney Care side is where we'll focus our clinical comments on this call. We'll probably rotate back and forth between the various parts of the enterprise each quarter. We have about 178,000 dialysis patients now in the U.S. That's about 35% of all the patients in the U.S. And from a vaccination point of view, our outcomes relative to the community are very strong; pneumonia vaccinations at 92% for patients, influenza vaccinations 92% for patients and teammate influenza vaccinations at 84%. And as many of you know, improving performance in vaccinations also leads to fewer hospitalizations and, as always, in our areas around the enterprise, our improved clinical outcomes are also very good for the taxpayer. For more color on U.S. Kidney Care financial results, let's hear from Javier Rodriguez. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Thank you, Kent. I'll divide my comments into two sections. First, I'll cover the quarter, and then secondly I will cover full year guidance. For the quarter, we had a strong operating income of $422 million, and let me cover some of the highlights. Number one, normalized NAG was 4.1%, which represented continued improvement over the prior quarters, and it is consistent with our guidance that we gave last year for three years of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our rate per treatment increased by $2.34 per treatment and it was mainly driven through higher acute mix and improved commercial mix. These improvements were partially offset by fewer treatment days which is normal in Q1, and as a reminder, the quarter benefited from an extra day due a leap year, and seasonally higher cost in treatment number one, primarily due to higher personnel costs from payroll taxes and higher pharma costs from seasonally higher Epo utilization due to the delay of the flu. Happy with the quarter. Our guidance for Kidney Care remains unchanged at $1.625 billion to $1.75 billion. And as always, our range in total captures the majority of the probabilistic outcomes and based on where we are today, we are more likely to be on the top half of the guidance range. The primary reason for leaving our guidance unchanged is driven by some economic uncertainties surrounding the exchange plans of the ACA. Let me summarize with four points on our experience on the ACA. Number one, it is working for patients. Americans who otherwise would not have insurance are now insured. Number two, many people are far better insured and have better coverage than they had before including many of our patients that are benefiting from the insurance coverage. Number three, the regulatory environment around exchanges is still being built. While many payers are living up to the spirit of the ACA, others are changing their fine print in their plan designs to avoid paying for expensive chronic diseases either by cost shifting to the patient or by making the plans unattractive for the expense of chronically ill in other ways. It might be helpful to give an example. We had in one state a plan that tried to limit dialysis benefits and shifted significant economic responsibility to the patient, which as many of you know, these patients can clearly not afford. Once we alerted the regulatory agencies, the plans were instructed to remedy their behavior. That being said, we're seeing more effort by some of the payers to improve their economics in the exchange plan by making it more difficult for dialysis patients to enroll. This is a complicated issue which will require regulatory environment. As you know, it happens to be a tough year because of the election and many are distracted. Therefore, the dynamics around enforcement are hard for us to predict. I'll state the obvious. Patients and providers will continue to work with regulators as this unfolds. Lastly, as you know, not unique to us, there are larger macroeconomics and political risks that are clouding the future of the exchanges. Therefore, it's hard to handicap with certainty how this will play out for us. We will talk about some of these issues in our longer term outlook in two weeks as we see you in Capital Markets. So I'll pass it back to you, Kent. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, JR. I'm going to cover international now. The losses, as you've seen, were $10 million in the quarter and this is in line with our guidance of approximately $40 million on the year. The most noteworthy new news on the international front is our definitive agreement to form a joint venture to grow our Kidney Care business in Asia with two partners, Khazanah and Mitsui. Khazanah is a highly respected sovereign wealth fund of the Government of Malaysia with an investment portfolio greater than $30 billion. And Mitsui, as many of you know, one of the largest and oldest business groups in Japan, with about $45 billion in annual revenue, and they recently designated healthcare as a key strategic domain for themselves corporately going forward. They're both experienced in healthcare already and are value-added partners for us, not just investors. One of their noteworthy successes in the Asian healthcare scene is they have a majority stake \u2013 approximately, a 60% stake in IHH Healthcare, which many don't realize is the second largest hospital company in the world by market cap. Their market cap is about $13 billion at this point, and we're very excited to have them as our partners. The financial terms, just at a summary level, each of Khazanah and Mitsui will invest $150 million over the next few years, and each will receive in return a 20% ownership stake. We will, of course, still be the majority owner, therefore, and we will be running the enterprise with them as our very active partners. Just to give you a sense of the current scope of the business, we have 64 clinics that serve about 3,300 patients across five countries in that part of the world. The definitive agreement is subject to a few closing conditions. So it could take some time to complete, but all three parties are working to make that happen as soon as is possible. And now let's turn to what has historically been called HealthCare Partners but is now, at least internally, referred to as the DaVita Medical Group, Vijay Kotte, the Chief Financial Officer. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in the $36 million are approximately $9 million of one-time costs. When adjusted for these one-time costs, we get a normalized operating income of $45 million for the quarter. One question you will likely ask is to reconcile this with the first quarter of last year. To do this, we start with 2015 Q1 OI of $60 million, subtract one-quarter of the $58 million in MA and Medicaid rate cuts we had previously disclosed or $15 million, and that gets you to $45 million, demonstrating a relatively flat underlying performance year-over-year. Now let's break down some of the drivers of performance for the quarter. There're some good things and some bad things. We'll start with the bad things. In addition to the rate cuts, Medicare Advantage enrollment in our legacy geographies grew less than in prior years and we grew in line with our geographies. Additionally, our commercial membership continues to decline with the market. Now let's turn to some good stuff. We continue to close transactions. Earlier in the quarter we closed on the Everett Clinic, a nationally recognized physician group that has over 500 clinicians across 20 plus clinics, serving over 300,000 patients with an expected annual revenue of over $400 million. In addition, within our existing geographies, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities including a number of small tuck-ins as well as a few larger acquisitions in process. One example is our prior announcement of our intent to combine with Mountain View Medical Group, which has 50 clinicians across 14 clinics serving over 80,000 patients which, if closed, will strengthen our already healthy capabilities in Colorado Springs. As we have said before, we continue building capabilities. Here are a couple of examples, one clinical and one operational. On the clinical side, we're expanding our very successful home care program from other geographies to Nevada, focusing on the needs of our high risk patients in order to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and re-admissions. On the operational front, we're centralizing national operations and expect to realize savings from scale and vendor consolidation. To remind you, there has been a significant transformation of the leadership team and that group is picking up new momentum every month. The progress on all these activities, we have a good shot at adding approximately $30 million to OI in the remaining three quarters of 2016, above the Q1 normalized rate of $170 million, bringing us to approximately $200 million for the year, the midpoint of our guidance range. So we are maintaining our guidance range of $175 million to $225 million, although we acknowledge that achieving the high end may be less likely. We'll provide more details on our ongoing investments and operational capabilities and our longer term outlook at Capital Markets Day in two weeks. Now I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Vijay. In regards to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $103 million in the first quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 40% in the quarter, when you adjust for the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the HCP Nevada hospice accrual. For the full year, we now expect the 2016 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. Now turning to cash flow. We continued to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $429 million in the first quarter and on an adjusted basis $1.88 billion for the 12 months. As we've discussed before, over time, Kidney Care contributes about 75% of our operating cash flows. HCP contributes about 25%, notably higher than its contribution percentage to our enterprise operating income. Regarding capital deployment, during the first quarter we purchased 3.7 million shares for $249 million at an average price of $67.61, but we have not made any additional repurchases since our last earnings call. Please note that we continuously weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. And now, finally, on to outlook, I'd just like to restate our outlook. We are still expecting our consolidated operating income for 2016 to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. We expect our operating income for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion, and we expect income for HCP to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million. And our operating cash flow expectation is in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. As always, these guidance ranges capture a majority of the probabilistic outcomes that we can foresee. And, with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator : Absolutely. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Sir, your line is open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks. Can you talk a little about the $9 million of one-time costs in HCP, what that was related to? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Sure. The one time costs, Kevin, were related to three primary things. One was the move of our California headquarters. Two is some compensation related accruals and the third is just some expense true-ups for prior periods. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then you guys earlier kind of quantified the 2017 MA rate headwind of $25 million. I guess how do you think about offsetting that and any kind of tailwinds you think about into next year versus this year? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : We're not going to give full 2017 guidance or that information, but related to the rate headwinds themselves there are some things related to the health insurer tax that will give some tailwinds but not enough to overcome those headwinds. And beyond that, we'll give more detail of our operational expectations and similar other things at Capital Markets in a couple of weeks. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Actually I was the health insurance fee, is that explicitly built into your contracts as a flow-through or is that something that you have to go back and kind of renegotiate as an offset? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : It varies by contract and so we've already addressed it with most of our payers. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess maybe last question, I guess as far as Epo costs for the year, I guess Amgen was pushing through a rate increase on Epo and then encouraging people to move over to Aranesp. Any thoughts there about how you guys are dealing with that? Is that the move that you've done or do you expect Epo pressure through the year? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : LeAnne, would you like to go ahead and take that one please. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Yes and you may need to clarify if I don't answer your question correctly. As it relates to Epogen pricing, we did not experience a price increase this year. So I don't know if that answers your question or you referred to Aranesp? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess my understanding was that Amgen was trying to move people to the longer-lasting Epo product, generally speaking maybe your contract might be different than others, but I wasn't sure if that was something that you guys were looking to do and whether that was going to be a cost advantage to you under your contract this year. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : We certainly use some Aranesp now in the population and we use both products. They are both very clinically appropriate for patients. And so we just use whichever the physician is ordering at this point in time and there's not a contractual difference. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Sir, you line is open. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Just first question I was curious, your perspective on the slowdown. I realize it's a much broader dynamic than just DaVita Medical Group, but the slowdown in Medicare Advantage enrollment, and if there is anything that the DaVita Medical Group physicians are seeing on the frontlines that might help inform what's going on? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : At this point, we don't have a good sense of what 2017, 2018, 2019 are going to look like. We still think Medicare Advantage is going to be growing in our markets as in the country overall. We and a lot of other people continue to add more services and capabilities that will fuel that fire. At the same time, if the payers decide in any given period to leave benefits stagnant or in fact even pull back a little bit, that has a big impact. And so we remain very bullish on fundamental growth. But at this point, the notion of sort of guesstimating what's going to happen in 2017 and 2018, we're not feeling certain enough to add any value there. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. That makes sense. And I'm just curious, when the Medical Group sees MA patients, is there any distinction in terms of the financials, if that's an employer group MA member or a regular, I guess, you'd say, retail MA member? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Can you restate the question, Matthew? I'm not understanding it. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, I guess, you think about the major Medicare Advantage plans, they typically have \u2013 for every 800 individual MA members, they maybe have another 200 that come from employer groups that are doing retiree coverage. It's all Medicare Advantage. I'm just wondering if there is any distinction that the Medical Group sees in terms of the financial arrangements, risk-taking arrangements between group and individual. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we have not seen anything significant in that vein. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And you don't really know how many is one or the other, is that correct? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I don't think we have anything useful to say about this, Matthew, but by Capital Markets, if there is anything useful to say, we'll be prepared to say it. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That sounds great. Just one last question. On the ACA Exchange plan dynamic, can you give us some sense of how to think about what the numbers are? In other words, I wouldn't think the numbers would be very big in terms of your overall patient base, but is there a higher concentration relative to, say, how the ACA Exchange enrollment compares to the overall insured population? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me take a stab at that, Matthew, and then you tell me if I'm hitting the right thing. Exchanges are a tiny percentage of what we're about. At the same time, when we have exchange business that's private insurance, that is additive in the same way that our private insurance patients are in general, since as you know, the 10% or so of patients we have are private subsidize the 90% that are government on which we lose money on the margin. And so exchanges are a tiny percentage but just like with the rest of private pay, little movements add up. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And have you ever contemplated starting your own exchange plans to get around the problems that you have had with the payers? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Up to this point, we have not. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Matthew. Operator : Thank you. At this point, I would like to open the line for Mr. Gary Lieberman. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I was going to make a joke, but I decided not to. Host is going to say, oh, well. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Matt? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hello, I thought someone is going to make a joke there for a second. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Matt, we want to hear the joke. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sorry, I don't have any jokes for anybody. Maybe talk about the joint venture and kind of the expectations for growth and maybe some of the startup losses that we should expect. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry, Gary, there is still some noise on this end. Could you go you ahead and repeat the question. My bad. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Maybe talk about the joint venture a little bit and the expectation for growth and what if any startup losses we would expect to see from it. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we are still losing money in the Asia market and that's not going to change in the near term because if anything, the addition of these two partners is going to accelerate some of our growth, which in the short term could actually increase our losses, kind of depends which countries we're growing the most in. So I don't know how much useful I can say beyond that but go ahead and fire off another question if you'd like. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess in terms of \u2013 a little different topic. Just foreign exchange rates, any thoughts there? They've been somewhat volatile. Any plans to hedge them or is it too small to really worry about it? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Up to this point we've done little or no hedging. We're paying a lot of attention but the numbers are so small and in particular, given we're spread across 10 different countries, 11 different countries and you kind of do the math, it just isn't that helpful at this point. But we're making sure we're talking to people who are more thoughtful and sophisticated than we are and trying to figure out exactly when we should start doing more of that. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. On to the ESAs, is it possible for you to tell us what percentage of patients are currently using Aranesp? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : I can answer that. We're predominantly an Epo shop, though it's quite small. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is it the 10% that you're allowed to use other ESAs or does that not count, I guess, if it's Aranesp? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : Yeah, Aranesp does not count against us. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then the pricing \u2013 the lack of pricing increase on Epo, does that have something to do with you moving some number of patients on to Aranesp? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs : No. No, that's not the case. And since I have the floor here, I'm being corrected that we did take a 1% price increase in January. So I apologize for that mistake. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay, that's all I have for right now. Thanks a lot. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Gary. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ms. Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. Ma'am, the line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. First question from me... Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi Margaret. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: There is a lot of moving pieces in HCP, and I'm sure you'll address a lot of them at your Capital Markets Day in a few weeks. But, that said, as you look at HCP and its trajectory really over the next couple of weeks, how important is that patient and revenue growth compared to that profitability improvement and where do you see that going? Can the newer market revenues exceed the legacy markets, since those appear to be slowing, and can those legacy markets even reaccelerate from here? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. A very fair question and certainly we're going to hit that hard in the Capital Markets, or at least to the best of our ability. We do think in a couple of our new markets the growth prospects over the next two years, three years on revenue, EBITDA and OI basis is material. But at the same time we actually have a lot of growth opportunities in the three inherited markets. And so which has more potential, I think we'd probably say they're pretty equivalent and if anything, the legacy markets have more. But it'd be nice to see them in a bit of a race. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And just to maybe pick a little bit more at that. We saw the senior revenues in the mid single-digit range in 2015. But as we look out again over that two-year to three-year time horizon, what would you be with happy with seeing in terms of that kind of new patient growth as well as the revenue growth? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Okay. What would we be happy to see? I would you say if you give us the gift of reflecting on that, we're going to talk about the range that we expect to see at Capital Markets, and then maybe address the happiness thing. But we'll definitely give you our sense of the range of likely outcomes here in a couple of weeks. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Fair enough. And then, on the Kidney Care side, the number of clinics that you guys are opening are growing a little bit faster than they have been the last few quarters and rightfully so. But should we expect a similar pace of net new centers opening throughout 2016 as you guys catch up with those longer approval time frames from last year? So are you going to reach 120 new clinics for the year? And how quickly can these new clinics help get your NAG back up to that 4.5% or maybe even higher over the near term? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : I'll turn that one over to Javier. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Thank you. We had 30 centers open in the first quarter; our range for the year is 90 centers to 110 centers. The last part of your question on NAG, we're still comfortable with the multiyear range that we addressed earlier, so 3.5% to 4.5%. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then last one from me. How is the acquisition of Renal Ventures coming along? When should we see kind of the initial impact on results and how long is it going to take for that chain to more closely resemble maybe the financial structure of the DaVita owned clinics? Thanks. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : JR, can you take that one please? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Yes, it's still going through the FTC, so the short answer is we don't know. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Okay. Thank you, Margaret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Gary Taylor of JPMC. Sir, your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good evening. Couple of questions. I wanted to go back to the international JV for a second and just make sure I understand what you said. Each of these investing $150 million over several years for 20%, so that was for each of those, right, so $300 million investment combined on 40% of the venture. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Correct. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So that implies something with an equity value of $750 million. Does DaVita make commensurate capital contribution, or is this capital light to you because you're contributing your market operational intelligence knowhow, et cetera, or what's your contribution? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Right. This investment will be the growth capital for the entity and what we're submitting into the partnership is the entity itself, which is the kind of things that you mentioned. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And are you contributing your existing centers in those five countries into the JV? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Correct. So our entire business in Kidney Care in that geographic area, that's the asset which we're contributing into the partnership. What they're contributing is the $150 million each of growth capital. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And it implies a pretty sizable capital deployment to that part of the world, I guess, compared to what you've invested thus far. So are there existing centers to acquire? Is this primarily development or will it be both? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : It will be both, but we're expecting that more of it will be acquisition than de novo. But it almost gets difficult to use some of the labels because in some of these countries, for example, China, you could end up with deal arrangements that are kind of a hybrid. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my other question \u2013 I just want to go back to commercial mix. I was taking notes, but I don't know if I missed those comments. Did you make a comment about commercial mix of patients, which I think was \u2013 actually grew year-over-year in 2015 for, I think, the first time in some time, so 1Q of 2016, did that change? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : It did grow in 2015 for the first time in a long time, and so we're pretty pleased with where we are at. I think we disclosed in the 10-K a 12% mix. We're rounding up to 12%. No, we were... Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is that.... James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : 11% \u2013 sorry. We were 11%, rounded to 11% in 2015. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : 11% of our total patients. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You only give us that annually, I believe; is that right? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : That is correct. We disclose it annually. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So the commercial mix continued to improve year-over-year in 1Q of 2016 or has that leveled out? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : We continued to improve in the quarter. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And is most of that \u2013 is that improvement being driven by exchanges or...? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : That is a portion of the improvement. The improvement we've seen over a multiple-quarter period is in part due to exchanges and in part due to improving economy and in some cases it's difficult to discern which is where. We know where the exchanges are but there also is some cannibalization. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Obviously a powerful trend, though. My last question. What \u2013 and I have a feeling maybe I'll get kicked down the curb a couple weeks here to Capital Markets, but what is your average commercial rate increase you're expecting for 2016 that's baked into guidance? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Yeah. We will go over our expectations on the RPT side at Capital Markets. And we may or may not get quite to that level of granularity. But, as always, we'll give you a three-year outlook on what we think about RPT or revenue per treatment. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this point I would like to open the line for Ms. Lisa Clive of Bernstein. Ma'am, you may begin with your question. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three for you. First of all, sorry if you I missed the details on this, but could you give us some color on the accrual for HCP, the hospice business in Nevada and am I right, this is about $16 million? Second, on dialysis, could you comment on the ESCO program and your experience with it so far? I believe you have something like 3,000 patients or 4,000 patients and according to your competitor, Medicare has just recently suggested the program could be expanded. Would you want to participate on a larger scale, or if not, why not? And then lastly, looking further in integrated care, FMC has actually just started a Medicare Advantage Dialysis SNP. Could you comment on what your integrated care platform looks like beyond ESCO and if you have any initiatives ongoing to grow this? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Let's go ahead and start with the first one. Go ahead, Vijay. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : Yes. So on the hospice, it's related to the Nevada hospice business. The reserve is for damages and liabilities associated with our potential eligibility determinations that majority of which predates our acquisition of that business in 2013. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And let's go ahead and we can always come back to that, Lisa, but let's go ahead and hit the second question on ESCOs and, Javier, you want to hit that, please. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Sure. We have about 4,000 patients in our ESCOs right now. It covers four states, three markets and it's too early to tell how these are going to turn out in our excitement on expansion or not. We've only been at it for a couple months so it's too early to go through that. As it relates to the C-SNPs, we now have five C-SNPs and we continue to find it a good growth vehicle that is really great for integration of transitions of care for the patient. So we'll continue to grow on that side. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Sorry. Are those C-SNPs, are you partnered with insurers on that or is that something you're doing unilaterally? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : We do have partnerships. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And maybe, Lisa, I'll add a couple of comments on some of these items. Kent Thiry here. First, regarding integrated care beyond ESCOs, we remain as intensely positive about that as we have been for years and think that more and more payers as well as more people in Congress are starting to understand the clinical and economic upside. And so we will continue to push integrated care outside of ESCOs, both for private pay and for Medicaid and for Medicare. It's impossible to predict when there might be an inflection point, but certainly we're in a lot higher quality conversations and doing a lot more deals of different sorts with payers now than any time before. And then going back to the hospice, we necessarily have to be pretty circumspect there because there's some active litigation, which is why our commentary is quite sketchy. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Understood. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Mr. Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Sir, your line is open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): For treatment and dialysis, it's trended a lot better than I would have thought for a much longer period of time. Can you remind me just what's driving that improvement and how long we can expect to see those declines? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Whit, the first part of your question for some reason, the phone cut off. And so we only heard the last half. Could you redo it please? Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. The question was just the G&A trends in dialysis, it's just trended much more favorably than we thought. I just wanted to know what's driving that and how long we can continue to see improvement? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I can tell you it's driven by excellent work by Javier and his team, but I'll let him complete the answer. JR? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Yes. And unfortunately less powerful, but due to some seasonality we expect G&A to be flat year-over-year. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): On a dollar basis or per treatment? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Per treatment basis. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And on HCP, I think you referenced in the last quarter that we should anticipate about $10 million of incremental investments this year. Is there any update around that number and does that include any of the corporate changes, relocating the corporate headquarter that you referenced in your prepared remarks? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry, could you do that one again? Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I'm sorry. Last quarter you communicated that we should expect about $10 million of incremental investments into HCP, I wanted to know if that was still the right number for 2016 and does it include the corporate headquarter change that you referenced? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners : So, one, it did not include the corporate headquarters and what we had planned to invest are still in our plans. There's no significant changes to that. They were intended to be in the later part of the year and as we continue to assess the year we'll see if that changes. But right now we have no plans to change. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And the $10 million are all investments that would be of a recurring nature. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. One last one. Just looking beyond ESAs, are there any other interesting therapies potentially coming to market, whether if there's an iron drug, vitamin D, just wondering if there are any other drugs that we haven't been paying attention to that you find to be interesting? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think there's any right now that would affect your three-year forecast. The big variable in the near and intermediate term is what kind of partnership we establish on the ESA front, which everybody is, of course, already aware of, and we're looking forward to wrapping up a good partnership with someone. But outside of that, there's really nothing to handicap right now. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. At this time, speakers there are no additional questions in queue. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Operator, unless you've already gotten somebody else. Have you? Operator : Right now we do not have any additional questions in queue. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, we will look forward to seeing a bunch of you and talking to the rest of you at our Annual Capital Markets session where we can obviously go into all this stuff with much more intensity and analysis. So we look forward to that. Take care. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Now, I will turn the meeting over to one of your host, Mr. Jim Gustafson. Sir, you may begin. Jim Gustafson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Joel, and welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners' Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statement. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all. We delivered solid adjusted operating income and strong cash flows in this particular quarter. The total adjusted operating income was $475 million as many of you have already seen, which were driven by the strong Kidney Care results at $431 million, and a disappointing DaVita Medical Group trajectory reflected with $44 million on a non-GAAP basis there. Operating cash flow is another bright spot of $517 million as we continue to successfully convert your earnings into your cash. We'll discuss several topics here before we get into Q&A. Number one is clinical outcomes, number two is DMG results, number three is U.S. Kidney Care, number four, a little bit of an update on international, and number five is just some additional financial enterprise level details. Let's start with clinical outcomes as we always do. We are first and foremost a care giving company and quite good at it. Now about 185,000 patients in the U.S. alone, about 35% of all dialysis patients in America. One of the areas where we've increased our focus is on reducing blood stream infections, a very big deal to our patients, a very big deal to their families, a very big deal to the tax payer. It's important because this keeps patients out of the hospital. Blood stream infections are one of the top five causes of hospitalizations for these patients and this impacts both QIP and Five Star. We're now performing blood culture tests on more than 90% of the situations when a patient is present with signs and symptoms of blood stream infections, will never get to a 100%, but 90% is remarkably higher than where we were ex years ago, and where so many dialysis centers are today. Despite testing a greater percentage of eligible patients, we've actually decreased our blood stream infection rate by 16% over the last 12 months. So we're working both sides of the equation, with tenacity and some success. On the DMG side, the DaVita Medical Group, year-to-date we've outperformed and the focused HEDIS measures that CMS uses attract Medicare Advantage clinical quality compared to the same period last year. And as a result, we are on track to achieve greater than four stars in all of our planned relationships. For some more detail on the DaVita Medical Group, I'd turn it over to Vijay Kotte. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group : Thanks, Kent. Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million excluding non-GAAP items, as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date we have financially underperformed relative to plan and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of the year. As a result, we're lowering our 2016 full year guidance to $110 million to $150 million. The decrease in guidance has four primary drivers : fee-for-service growth; prior-year revenue reconciliation; Medicare Advantage growth; and rebranding effort. To provide a little more color, let me walk you through those. First, our fee-for-service revenue growth has not met our expectations. Our target was 6% year-over-year, but we're achieving 3%. Second, we made a mistake forecasting 2016 operating profit by overestimating expected reconciliation payments for prior year Medicare Advantage revenue. Third, while our in-year Medicare Advantage membership growth has been in line with broader enrollment trends and the geographies we operate in, is lower than we previously expected. Fourth, as we stated in our last call, we are rebranding from HealthCare Partners to the DaVita Medical Group. To accomplish this, we expect to spend $5 million to $10 million this year that wasn't previously included in our forecast. In addition, we will need to accelerate the non-cash amortization of $110 million worth of existing trademark intangibles associated with the legacy HealthCare Partners brand. This accelerated amortization has been excluded from our revised 2016 and long-term guidance. Despite these disappointments, we're making good progress on the key items we identified at Capital Markets. In terms of fee-for-service to value conversion, we're progressing in contracting discussions with health plan, while developing value based care capabilities in our newer markets. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business, which we believe will fuel our long-term success. One example is our investment in seven new de novo clinics, which are a capital efficient growth platform similar to what you are used to seeing in Kidney Care. Finally, as we look towards our long-term outlook, our 2019 OI target remain $250 million. Now, I'll turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to speak a little bit more about Kidney Care. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations, including our own ESRD patients. Since then, two new pieces of legislation that are supported by the dialysis community have been introduced in Congress. The first is called the Dialysis PATIENT Demonstration Act and that provides for true integrated care model for Kidney Care patients. The second is called the ESRD Choice Act of 2016 and that would finally allow for ESRD patients to enroll an MA plan. Both of these acts would be a great gift to ESRD patients and play to our long term strategy of integrated care. We're hopeful about their prospects in Congress due to the strong bipartisan support and we will continue to work hard to pursue integrated care for our patients. Now on to our quarterly results. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a strong and reasonably straight forward quarter, so I won't go into much detail here. As Kent said, we delivered strong operating income of $431 million due to a slight improvement in revenue per treatment over Q1 as well as a slight reduction in cost per treatment. With respect to growth, our normalized non-acquired growth for the quarter was 4.3%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. With the first half of the year now behind us, we are raising the bottom end of our 2016 guidance range by $50 million. This is consistent with our comments from last quarter that were more likely to be in the top half of our original guidance. With this change, our new Kidney Care operating income guidance for 2016 is now $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion. As for next year, we plan to provide 2017 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call. We made this change last year because ACA plans have become a more meaningful part of our commercial mix. This has added some new drivers of upside and downside to our business and our industry, as well as some seasonality. Providing guidance on our fourth quarter call allows us to incorporate the additional visibility we gain during open enrollment period. Before I turn it back to KT, I want to close by saying, we remain excited about the fundamentals of our business, the gradual shift toward integrated care, and the fact that our teammates are recognized for providing the best outcomes and quality of life for kidney patients. Now back to Kent to discuss our international business. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Okay. Thank you, JR. International losses, $13 million in the quarter, which is pretty much in line with our guidance of approximately $40 million in losses on the full year. We continue to maintain what we told you I think about a year ago that we committed to try to achieve breakeven by 2018 in our current market portfolio excluding any new countries and we are standing by that. And a number of you probably saw that we did in fact close the transaction that we had to announce four weeks to five weeks to six weeks ago, that being our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui on August 1. Just to refresh your memory, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership over time. At the closing, each provided $50 million of funding to the JV in return, while each receiving a 6.7% stake. We're excited to have them as partners. We have a very long-term point of view about the opportunity in that part of the world, as do they, and we think they're going to help us accelerate and deepen our growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger to cover some more enterprise financials. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Kent. And just a little more about our Asia-Pacific joint venture. In regard to the JV with Khazanah and Mitsui, please note that we expect that this joint venture will be deconsolidated from our financials and that future operating results will run through equity investment income for our pro rata share of ownership in the joint venture. Please note that we expect to record a material non-cash one time gain in connection with the formation of this JV and this gain is excluded from our guidance. Now on to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the second quarter, consistent with the recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 37.2% in the quarter when adjusted for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of a state income tax benefit. We expect the full-year effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners on our adjusted income for 2016 to be in the range of 39% to 40%. Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $517 million in the quarter and $2.06 billion for the last 12 months. The last 12 months benefited from the timing of tax payments. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion. One thing to keep in mind when thinking about the cash flows of our individual operating segments is that, DMG generates a disproportionately higher share of our cash flows and its share of our adjusted operating income. While the midpoint of our DMG guidance for adjusted operating income is $130 million, the business has a year-to-date annual run rate of $200 million in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, as you will recall, there is a cash tax reduction of approximately $100 million per year, which is the equivalent to $167 million improvement in pre-tax operating income. This cash tax benefit is due to the tax basis step-up created when we acquired the Medical Group. And finally, as the vast majority of DMG's business is capitated care, where we are paid before and current expenses, it has favorable cash flow characteristics with low to negative working capital. Thus, DMG contributes more to our operating cash flows than is first apparent when looking at operating income. We continue to have a very strong cash balance with $1.68 million in cash and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. Additionally, as disclosed in our earnings release, our board of directors just increased our share repurchase authorization from the remaining $259 million to now $1.5 billion. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Kent Thiry. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : I'll just make a few summary comments before we go to Q&A. Number one, with the DaVita Medical Group, we're certainly sorry that we had to reduce the guidance. In fact, it will take even more time to get it to where we think we can be regularly growing earnings and we're intensely intent on doing, but it will take some time. Number two, DaVita Kidney Care, wonderfully solid results yet again, probably even better than that, at the same time as JR has talked about recently, we could have some choppiness at the high levels. And we are, maniacally continuing to invest in becoming even more differentiated than we are today in quality and service and physician experience and IT et cetera. Third and fourth is the cash flow. Your cash flow continues to be a powerful weapon to be deployed in your defense and on offense. And lastly, fourth, we continue to have a lot of belief in our overall business platform, everything from a geographic footprint, for capabilities by function, et cetera, et cetera. So, thank you all very much and Joel, could you please open it up for Q&A. Operator : Absolutely, sir. So for the participants on the phone, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Operator, are you having any problems? Operator : I'm just waiting for the participants. But, at the moment, we don't have an incoming question. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Joel, I show seven people in the queue. Operator : Okay. One moment. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Hey, Joel. There might be something wrong with the equipment that you're looking at, so perhaps, while the first person ask their question, you can do some checking with one or the other people there. Operator : Yes, I'll double check sir because those are people that are on the queue. , but let me \u2013 yeah, let me open up their line now, hold on. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Okay. But that's okay to let them in Joel, because we know that there is a number of people who ask questions each and every call. So, it's okay if they do that. Operator : Okay. All right. Okay. So, we have our first question from the line of Mr. Chris Rigg. Mr. Rigg, your line is open. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about DMG here. I guess just with regard to the fee-for-service revenue only growing at 3% versus 6%, is that tied to the Everett Clinic or is that something completely different? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : It's pretty much across the board although, of course, the Everett Clinic is the biggest single source, but we're just a little bit soft in a number of different areas, and the good news or bad news depending how you look at it is, we can operate some parts of that much better outside of the Everett Clinic and within the Everett Clinic, which operates, so accidently, they had kind of an uncharacteristic stumble. And so, it's a mix of all of our fee-for-service locations nothing really jumping out. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then just a little bit forward thinking on the ESRD choice legislation that you guys highlighted. I mean how would that, at least, at a high level work in your guys opinion? Would you get better rates from the MA plans than you currently get on the fee-for-service side? Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : There is a couple of ways about it and I'll chime in to Javier, and then LeAnne if you want to supplement. The main thing is that the lives would be attributed to the dialysis clinic. And so, therefore, the dialysis clinic would become the medical home, sort of de facto medical home, because we'd have the patients for 12 hours. The other important thing is that on the revenue side, instead of having a benchmark, which is a little of a black box thing, as you get a number, it would be linked to MA, and so the revenues would be a lot more predictable. Does that answer your question? Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Thanks a lot. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rigg. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Matthew Borsch. Sir, your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hi, this is Tejus (19:36) joining on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. There has been some recent articles about insurers focusing on third-party payments from charities like American Kidney Fund and even across other subsectors as well. I think it's been the longstanding practice for dialysis companies to donate to these charities, but for those of us less familiar, can you provide some color on how AKF fits into your overall strategy and any dynamics at play regarding increased focus? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : And before we do that, before Javier does that, this is KT, just coming back again, I want to make sure we covered all aspects of the previous questioners question. And in general, we do get paid more for an MA dialysis patient than a Medicare fee-for-service patient. It is totally intuitively to be expected, because if you have MA risk, if you're in MA plan, you care a lot more about aggregate integrated care because you're at risk on the entire expense for the patient. And so, coming to us where you get some of what we provide and therefore lower hospitalizations and happier repeat patients/customers, it is natural that given our more robust value proposition that the payer pays us more and in fact is happier than they would be paying less for fee-for-service type service. Now, on to the next question. Javier? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Sure, Matthew. Thank you for the question. First of all, it's probably worth stepping back and reviewing level setting here. We believe that it is vital for patients of all different disease states to have premium assistance. It is a critical part of our healthcare system and has been so for decades. And of course, we got to have appropriate rules. So those need to be reviewed periodically. In Kidney Care, we have been donating and so have all other providers to help patients with end-stage renal disease for decades in order to be assisted with their premium. The OIG has reviewed that framework more than once and actually just did it over a year ago or so. And so, that framework has been vetted and, of course, we have to make sure that we all stay and abide by the rules that were outlined by the OIG. Did I get to what you're going to... Unknown Speaker : Yeah. That was very helpful. Thanks. And just a quick kind of follow-up modeling question. For the D&A, in the quarter looks like there was an uptick there. Was that associated with the accelerated amortization from the rebranding? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : No, it was not. We have not started the acceleration, that's a forward-looking event, but we will keep you informed about that matter as we determine the final amortization periods. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : But perhaps we can expect... Unknown Speaker : Okay. Can you comment on the uptick though? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Why don't you give us... James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : It's primarily, excuse me, it's primarily the Everett Clinic. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks very much. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : And so we'll check and if there's any answer that should be appended to, primarily the Everett Clinic, we'll get it back out in the next 5 minutes, 10 minutes. But, next one please, Joel? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Mr. Fischbeck, your line is open. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Hi. Thank you. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. So, question here on the transaction that you announced with Tandigm or rather selling a portion of it. So, the question here is, who did you sell the interest to? And the question, (23:34), we would like to know whether this was a strategic player maybe who could potentially help save money there or was it done for financial reasons? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : On, Tandigm, what we did is sold a part of our stake back to IBC, Independence Blue Cross, who has been our partner in Tandigm since day one and what both sides agreed was to do this in order to create more alignment between IBC and Tandigm. Otherwise, we were in a situation where IBC got a 100% of the profits in their non-Tandigm business, only 50% in the Tandigm part of the business, and this lack of alignment was getting in the way of some of the glass breaking that needed to go on in order to move the entire organization forward. And so we agreed to be bought out in part to get that alignment, and who knows, perhaps we'll get to \u2013 go backup to a higher percentage over time. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Okay, that's helpful. And then staying a little bit on that front and specifically on the production in \u2013 I guess outlook for operating income for that part of the business, HCP or DaVita Medical Group. So specifically, how should we think about this reduction as it relates to the sale in the stake and also the exit in Arizona markets. So, is that, the guidance changed to reflect those two things or there is chance to a core performance as well? And then if it is and if you could please quantify the two different sort of buckets, the asset sales versus the core performance of the business? Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Okay. I'm going to turn that to Vijay. There was a part on Arizona and then perhaps in relationship of Arizona with Tandigm and then core performance separate from those two if I heard correctly... Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Correct. That's correct. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Were those the three parts, please? Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Yes. Exactly, yes. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Okay. Thanks. Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group : So, Joanna, I think the first question was related to, does the guidance change, is that reflective or is that driven by the change in ownership in Arizona and in Tandigm. So it is incorporated, it is not a driving component. The four items that we called out are the primary factors that are changing our guidance expectations for the year. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : So, is there a way to quantify those? So I've heard you said $5 million to $6 million of this additional cost from rebranding. So is there other, I guess, the other delta, the other part of the delta is (26:17) for service and MA, right? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group : Yeah. One is the fee-for-service growth being only 3% versus our expected 6% and then the in-year MA growth and then the stake in our estimate on the prior year revenue reconciliation amount. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : So is there a way to sort of out of those four things versus the change in coming from the sale of Tandigm and Arizona? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group : I would... Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : I think, let me take a stab at the answer to the question I think you're asking. Those four factors explain the change in guidance. And the Tandigm and Arizona transactions had little to no impact on go forward guidance. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Great. That's what I was getting. Yes, exactly. Thank you so much. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. So the next question comes from the line of Mr. Gary Lieberman. Mr. Lieberman, your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe to stay with that last question for a second, is it possible to breakout those four components to put a dollar number on each one of those for the impact because it was a fairly large change for the guidance? Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group : Yeah. I think all four are pretty significant meaty parts of it, and we're not going to attribute a dollar to each one individually, but each one is significant. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then I guess maybe just going back to the explanations for the sale of Tandigm. I guess, could you just walk us through that? In other words, wasn't entirely clear kind of exactly what the driver was there? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Sure. I can. In establishing Tandigm where you know that IBC and DaVita together stood up 100,000 member at risk HMO essentially in a year, so an exceptionally aggressive implementation. It is necessary for us to work for a lot of the home departments within IBC and also to be negotiating with the same hospitals that IBC is negotiating with for their other products. And what we found is some IBC team mates as you would rationally expect, say hey, an extra dollar of hospital rate relief goes a 100% to IBC if I put it in this product, negotiated for here, and only 50% if I negotiate for their. Now the fact is, those perceptions are going to change over time because of the offensive potential of Tandigm and because more and more IBC people are becoming a part of Tandigm. But in the mean time, rather than try to deal with some of that understandable organizational friction, we said the simplest way to deal with it in the near-term is to let us be bought down. And so all of IBC could see that they had a significant majority of the profits in either case. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then you mentioned the opportunity to potentially increase your ownership stake back up. How would that work? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Correct. Without going into a lot of detail, we have some rights with respect to buying back up to our prior position. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So you're still committed to Tandigm and it's going well compared to when you initially did the deal or how would you characterize that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : We're still committed to Tandigm and they're doing well. I kind of hate saying yes or no to something like that. It's a young company. We're making progress every quarter. If you hit plan, then it sounds like you're doing well, but it could have been you made too soft a plan, if you're missing it, it can sound like you're doing poorly, but it could have been you set a good aggressive plan or had a little bad luck. And so, all I can say is that we're a lot better today than we were four months ago. We're better four months ago than eight months ago. We've got some new executives onboard and so we're feeling pretty darn good. But we also set out to do something that really hasn't been done very often. And so, we just don't have a lot of illusions about skipping up the mountain. We know we're going to skin our knees a couple of times on the way. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then may be turning towards the comments by some of the managed care companies this quarter regarding the premiums from the American Kidney Fund. It sounds like some of them may actually be talking to state insurance commissioners or pushing back in other ways to maybe get out of taking those premiums. Can you talk about any conversations that you've had or your thoughts, generally speaking, about how any of this might transpire? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Sure, Gary, this is Javier. And again, it's very useful to step back a bit. And so, in a world right now, where in 2014 the exchanges came into play, we've heard so much about the risk pools and how they're not well funded. And so a new product comes into market. Our dialysis patients and our social workers work really hard to make sure that they explain and understand their new product and at that time the patient and the patient alone makes a decision on what's right for them. As you know, many of the chronic and high cost disease states have caused these risk pools to be challenging to the payers. I think that they've in some instances have highlighted ESRD expense, but the reality is that it's pretty much our chronic diseases. So, CMS is evaluating third-party premium assistance to see what their stance is, but it's complicated around the healthcare continuum. And so, right now they're evaluating because the last thing they want to do is use a broad brush and then have consequences on one disease state versus another. So, right now what's going on is that in every state people are trying to lobby to get one thing or another. What we have found is that regulators once they really hear our patients' needs and what they literally need as choice, they're quite sympathetic to the cause and so it will play out state-by-state and of course the patients and ourselves will do the best we can to make sure that they have right to these products regardless of the fact that they end up being expensive patients. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's very helpful. And then maybe final question just on \u2013 staying on the Kidney Care front. It looks like patient care cost per treatment was down marginally in the quarter. Any changes specifically on use of drugs and then to the extent that you guys are willing to comment on any negotiations or conversations with alternative providers of ESA or your current supplier? Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Hi, Gary, thanks for the question. No big change on utilization of med. And there is nothing new to update. The negotiations continue and all the dynamics that we've explained before are the same. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Thanks, Gary. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lieberman. The next question comes from the line of Mr. John Ransom. Mr. Ransom, your line is now open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, nobody ever calls me Mr. so that's a nice honorary. A couple of things. Kent, let's kind of step back and think big picture on HealthCare Partners now renamed. You've been in this for four years. Clearly the numbers haven't been what we all hope they would be. How much of that do you attribute to structural factors and what I would say about that is maybe not as many markets were ready for this revolution as we thought? Or secondly how much of it do you say, well, gosh, maybe we didn't execute as well as we thought we could have, if it's possible to do that? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Yeah. It's a very fair point, maybe I'd refer to the four chapters. Chapter one was huge reimbursement cut, $200 million of OI loss because HealthCare Partners was more adept than others that capturing the equity codes, which we knew going in, but didn't anticipate the dramatic change in policy. We knew there would be some softening there and some compression and we knew it wouldn't be small, but we did not \u2013 with respect to what happened so much and so quickly, and therefore we own that. So, chapter one was breathtaking reimbursement, that's $200 million annually. Chapter two was pretty much total displacement of the leadership; California, Nevada, Florida, the three markets, potentially 100% change and that took time. And, of course, while you're doing it, it does get in the way of things getting done and it does create some transitional trauma. Chapter three is bring in the new infrastructure. You can buy the house on the best lot with the best architectural bones. But if it needs new heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, you got a lot of work to do. It doesn't really start showing up until it's done that makes a hell of a difference as to the experience of going inside. And so that's a chapter we're in the midst of right now. Chapter four is the one we're just starting to feel in some places where we're bringing a new level of operating excellence, a new level of innovation and enhanced value proposition, new levels of creativity and contracting. But these are just little saplings breaking through the surface right now. The good news is they're there and we're ready to take care of them. So, I would divide the world into four chapters and then I would offer up my empathy for the fact that so many of the shareholders have had to lift through the excruciating burden of chapters one through three. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's a great answer, and I've a follow up for Javier. Just to push back a little bit on this foundation issue. I mean, these patients, would be covered by Medicare. It's not as though they would be bereft to health insurance or then \u2013 I think, I've read 5,500 or so patients are now on exchanges, being paid full by the foundations. I mean, aren't you arguing that United Healthcare and Anthem should take, I don't know, $5,000-$10,000 in premium and have a fair cost of over $100,000? I mean, how can we make that argument to these plans, when they could be covered under the public plans that's and I would assume, you guys have your proportional share of the 5,500, just stepping back from kind of a public policy standpoint. How do you, at a time when the plans are losing money in the exchanges, how do you argue to them that they should cover people that could be covered for a fraction of the cost under Medicare? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Yeah. A couple of things. If you're on Medicare, you're not eligible, as we go on the exchange. And so, that is the benefit that you have. For the patients, that switch, I don't know, if the number you cited is right or not, we haven't disclosed those numbers. It is a very personal decision that is based on access to specialists, drugs, and other things. So, the patient actually do get differentiated care. And so the reality of this thing is that the system, set it up for individuals to make a choice as to what their best coverage is and so patients made that choice, and it's a very personal decision that I can't decide whether that's right or wrong for the system, but rather they get to make the choice. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's it from me. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : One might well also ask the question how appropriate is for plans to make multiple times the magnitude of profit on MA patients that all the providers in America do combine, that might be another philosophical question to ask. The fact is, it gets interesting. There is pockets of profitability within healthcare and then you have pockets of loss. For examples, for us about 80% of our patients are Medicare fee-for-service and we lose money on every one of them. It really doesn't make any sense and so you end up having to kind of think of it as an ecosystem, where the plans might look like excessive margin somewhere and then have losses elsewhere, where we take care of some patients and an absolute significant unambiguous loss. In other cases, have higher margins than you would expect us to. So, you've sort of have to end up looking at it as an ecosystem and see if anyone part of it is getting out of balance, because it's hard to get each individual part of it exactly right. Operator, go ahead with the next question. Operator : All right. So, we have another question from the line of Mr. Whit Mayo. Sir, your line is now open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Excuse me, good afternoon. Maybe I missed this, but can you go back to the prior year revenue headwind within DMG or DMG \u2013 was that prior to your issue in the quarter or is this something that you expect to hit in the second half? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : It was something that we expected to receive and recognize in the second half of the year. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Maybe just help us understand the process around identifying and truing up those claims and what specifically this is? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : This is not related to claims, this is about revenue and the kind of finalization of revenue with CMS. And we typically bring that in on a cash basis in the second part of the year and our estimate of that was higher than what we now believe that amount to be that we will receive in the back half. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And if you just look at the four buckets that you've outlined I guess the sources of underperformers, if you will, within the be it medical group, the rebranding doesn't seem to be an issue that's probably going to recur into 2017, maybe it does to some extent, the prior year revenue that the stuff happens, but I would imagine that's probably something that doesn't recur next year. So how much of the guide down would you call to be \u2013 would be more from transient factors? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : I think the way you're thinking about it is right, and we don't want go any further into what 2017 would look like, but I think the way you think about it is right. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : I'll go a tad further than that, because right on the mistake we made in forecasting and unfortunately cut it before we were into that forecasted period, we certainly hope that that doesn't recur. We like everyone else hope that MA enrollment growth is higher the next couple of years than the last couple that's not entirely under our control of course, it depends on what government policy comes out in terms of rates to a great extent. We're working hard to nudge off that fee-for-service growth, so we don't want that to be recurring, and we don't expect it to be recurring in the long run, but we don't know how quickly we're going to be able to either bump it up to take out some of the expenses associated with not having higher growth, and I'm missing the fourth one, but I think you \u2013 you also nailed that one, enough said. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And maybe just remind us, renal ventures, is this included in your guidance at this point and it feels like maybe this deal is taking a little bit longer than maybe we anticipated just an update with the timing of that. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Sure. The answer to the first question is, it is not included as to the timing. We are equally as frustrated and are moving as quickly as we can, we anticipate back in fourth quarter closing. As of now, but as you know that is a moving target. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Any specific reason that just for the hold up on the deal or is it just one of those things, it's out of everyone's control. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : It's normal profit but low for \u2013 I can't exactly tell you why, it's just the normal profit, but it's just gone low it seems that every step of the process. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Understood. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Gary Taylor. Mr. Taylor, your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. Couple of questions. First on California, will that Arizona divestiture, will that close in third quarter? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : That was already \u2013 that closed within Q2. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So it's included in the cash flow statement proceeds for the six-month, which is not very much. Can you just remind us then of \u2013 in that market, what the revenue model was in the membership. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : We don't typically disclose our numbers on a market basis. So I'd refrain from giving you that level of detail, is there more specific question you can ask? Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, I guess, I'm trying to understand what it was you sold and who do you sold it to and what the revenues come out for HCP. Obviously, you said it won't have a much impact on operating income, so apparently it wasn't that profitable, but we do need to model HCP revenues on a go forward basis. So any help there would be good. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Gary, absolutely fair questions and we didn't think of that one ahead of time and we don't want to establish \u2013 on the one hand, we don't want to establish new precedent for disclosing things and on the other hand, we don't want to keep it from being able to take care of your model. So, we'll work on it and say, hey, everybody it was a follow-up call can figure out what we can say or not say about the Arizona particulars, but for us to do it spontaneously is a little too nerve-racking. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. On commercial mix, improved about 100 basis points last year, I believe, and I did note that revenue per treatment growth slowed this quarter year-over-year. So, I didn't hear you call anything out. So I'm presuming you're just counting that growth of commercial mix and are we right to think that maybe commercial mix is pretty stable year-over-year, is that down? Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : This is Javier again. So I think you're alluding to, 2014, we disclosed 10% and revenue per treatment was $342 million and 2015 we disclosed 11% revenue $348 million as you saw we're $351 million. We haven't disclosed the mix. So, it's fair to say that stable with a slight pump. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. On the HCP side question. Are any of the rates contractually tied to the health industry fee holiday, in another words, we've heard from some plans that, as they get released in 2017, and not have to pay this industry fee holiday, some of their capitated groups contractually get a bump, because they effectively had to eat, as you did some rate cuts over the last few years. So, this is effectively a net rate increase to the plans and not to have pay this fee. Will HCP benefit contractually from that in 2017? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Again, as it relates to our contracts, there is a \u2013 it's a mixed bag. Some of our contracts will have it flow through, others won't, but in those where it does flow through, there may be some slight pickups there for the one-time period, as you know all the details we're up. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And last question, I believe at Investor Day, you had sized $25 million Medicare headwind for HCP, in 2017. And I wonder if there is any update to that, obviously we're thinking about potential negative impact of the dual risk or model change in some markets, but positive in others and then maybe a little bit of benefit from this industry fee holiday. At this point, is that $25 million still the best number? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : That is still the best number, including all the things you just described. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, all right. Thank you. James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : Thank you, Gary. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from the line of Ms. Lisa Clive. Ms Clive, your line is now open. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay, thanks. Three questions, just the HCP Arizona sale, could you talk to the rational for that? Second question, just on the write downs that we've had on HCP, over the last few quarters, are we at the bottom here or are there potentially more to come and obviously it depends on what your accountants say, but just be helpful to think through that. And then the third question is on the international business you mentioned a goodwill impairment charge, just wondering what the source of that was? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Let me first start on the Arizona divesture. In short, we got a good offer that was presented to us and as we looked at the alternatives, the way that we did invest and deploy our resources for a greater value, it was the right trade-off. So we decided to accept that offer and divest. Jim, you want to touch on the...? James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer : In regards to the goodwill impairment that we took in the quarter, as we look forward there is a chance that we will have another impairment. As we disclosed in our 10-Q, we have a negative cushion in our Nevada and Florida markets, and there's a very kind of nuanced and detailed accounting rules around impairment accounting, and so when you have a negative cushion, that means that your fair value is less than your book value. And so if there was any further deterioration in performance or in our outlook of those markets, we could see a further impairment. Additionally, the FASB is looking at changing the rules around accounting for goodwill impairments. When they do that, there may be an effect related to the adoption of those new rules. And then the final part of your question was an international impairment. We did have a small international impairment last year, but we did not have one this year. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. Just one follow-up on the Arizona deal. Who did you actually sell to? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : I don't know if we're authorized to say. Does anybody around the table know for sure? I don't know the contracts by \u2013 I tell you if you could call in and we'll check in now if it's fine, it's also relatively commonly known in the market in case you know anyone there, but we'd happy to give the answer once we confirm that we were legally allowed to. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I was just curious as to what sort of entity would give you a good deal to take it off your hands. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Yeah. For us, it was better for us to focus on other markets than that one. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Thanks for that. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Clive. We have another question from the line of Ms. Margaret Kaczor. Ma'am, your line is now open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. I was hoping to start out with exchange plans. Over the last couple of calls, this has been a popular topic for you guys. But now that we're in August, halfway through the year, are you seeing the regulatory environment improving, stabilizing or patients receiving adequate access to care, especially near term? Any trend data that you guys may have would be helpful. Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care : Yes. We actually don't have any significant change. The patients are receiving great care. And right now, as we stated earlier in the call, there is a lot to be played, so a lot of rules and enforcement is still to be played, but right now there is nothing different to report than what we told you in Capital Markets Day. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : And I think the way I would put it is that the regulatory agency's capacity to enforce the regulations with respect to exchanges remain weak, either by virtue of lack of motivation because they're worried about the exchange's financial liability or because they just don't have the resources. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Is that something that can change at some point in the next 6 months, 12 months, 18 months? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Yes, it could change and it's likely to change some, but one wouldn't want to pin one's hopes on it changing a lot. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on your international ventures, how is Asia developing and some of these other countries like Saudi Arabia developing? And then how do you compare those businesses versus some of your clinics in Germany both in terms of patients, investments going forward and profitability profile? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : We're in 11 other countries now and the microeconomics and growth trajectory are different in every one. The good news is that in virtually every one, the microeconomics work at a very reasonable market share position. So, even if we're losing money now in a country just by increasing our scale with the existing achieved microeconomics of our current centers, we know we're on the path to the promise land of, first, being profitable and then, second, having an adequate cumulative return. But the differences are quite large, and Germany and Saudi are two of our more successful markets from many perspectives including the microeconomics. Am I getting to your question? Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Well, and part of it becomes how do you guys bridge to that profitability gap you talked about at the Capital Markets Day, and what impact and how many years really will it take for China to either be material as well as profitable? Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : So I don't know is the answer with respect to China. That day is almost certainly outside your investment time horizon, and yet the only way to become a leader in China is to get into China and learn it, very difficult to try to transplant your way in X years later. In China, we'll probably end up with a few partners is the right way to do it. Just as we concluded in Asia, despite the fact that we were doing well in Southeast Asia partnering with Khazanah and Mitsui we thought was going to help us grow faster and better everything from helping us recruit more talent, helping us oversee what we have, helping us interact with the government more and the regulators. So, in all sorts of ways, we learned important lessons, which should make the next five years very different from the last five years, but having said all that, in China in particular, you want to be very careful before you start talking about any bullish forecast because it is one tough place to do business. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, and then one last question. We're trying to balance some of the growth within dialysis, again some of the other companies we cover and what we're noticing is as some of the acute care demand at least for equipment is growing a little bit faster, you are seeing PD growth a little bit faster, so maybe what are you guys seeing in the field, are you actually seeing acute care patients improve in PD, and how does that end up benefiting you guys? Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Yeah, thank you, Margaret. We are seeing our PD grow similarly than our non-acquired growth in in-center, so we're not seeing a disproportionate growth there. And as it relates to our acute business, there is noting that stands out to our historical trend, so it could be that equipment of course is in this line with services and that equipment could be old or someone decides that they want to do some treatments in their hospital and/or change their staffing ratios and instead of having a room where they conduct dialysis, they want to go bed-to-bed in the hospital, so it's really hard to predict the alignment there, but we're not seeing anything different in our business. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ms. Kaczor. At the moment, speakers, we have no more questions over the phone. Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners : All right. Thank you very much, everyone, for your interest in DaVita. We'll do our best for you in between now and our next call. Take care. Operator : Thank you, all speakers. So, that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Gustafson. Sir, you may now begin. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Joseph, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of the DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statement. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining on our call. We will start as we always do with our clinical performance, and then I will return before Q&A. Within the DaVita Medical Group, we mentioned during our Q2 call that we outperformed in clinical quality compared to the same period in the prior year. Our strong performance has continued and we remain on track to achieve four stars or greater for our patients within each of our major health plan relationships. Within Kidney Care, we continue to focus on vascular access, where strong performance significantly improved survival and prevents unnecessary hospitalizations. The publically reported government data released just this October shows that we've significantly outperformed the industry in this important clinical area. Lets now move on to the non-clinical subjects, and I'll turn it over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Since we spoke last, a lot has happened. I will cover three topics. Number one, Monday's announcement; number two, our Q3 Kidney Care performance; and number three, our outlook. So let's get started. We hope that the release on Monday was helpful. I won't be repetitive here, but we've had a lot of questions. So let me take some. And if I miss them, please bring them up in Q&A. As a forewarning, I'll go into some technical detail because the subject matter requires it. First, why did we announce the decision on Monday, only two days before our earning call? It's a simple answer. This is open enrollment. It started yesterday, and we needed to provide clarity to our patients and our teammates. Second, is this is a permanent change in policy? No, we have only temporarily suspended support for applications to the American Kidney Fund for patients enrolled in minimum essential Medicaid coverage. When CMS provides guidance, which we expect will be within a couple of weeks, we will evaluate our future policy. Third, does our announcement signify a concern over our historical practices? No. Our historical practices were legal and compliant. That said, the language in the RFI may confuse some. So I thought it would be useful to clarify further. The RFI had primarily three concerns. One, whether patients enrolled in Medicare purchased an ACA plan that was duplicative in coverage. None of our patients who were enrolled in Medicare enrolled in the ACA plan. The regulation cited in the RFI, which referred to Medicare Supplemental Plan, is not germane to the ACA plan. Number two, whether patients lost their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA plan and, therefore, were exposed to additional costs. Our patients did not lose their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA plan and, as a result, were not exposed to additional costs. Consistent with CMS own education materials, we educated our patients on the ability to purchase an ACA plan while retaining Medicaid coverage as a secondary. These patients did not apply for tax credits and subsidies. And three, whether patients experienced a disruption in continuative care as a result of purchasing an ACA plan. Just a small portion of our Medicaid patients made the choice to purchase an ACA plan. And they did so for their own personal reasons, such as to have access to specialists who do not accept Medicaid, or increased chance of qualifying for transplantation or other reasons. We're not aware of any patient experiencing a disruption in care, likely because those patients who would have had such a disruption made the choice not to enroll in an ACA plan. Lastly, there have been some questions around comparing our disclosure of 5,000 patients versus public information from other providers. I believe that the confusion is around some definitions. When we refer to individual market plans, or ACA plans, we refer to the full universe of individual plans, whether they're sold on or off the government-run exchanges. A distinction between these types of plans is not relevant, because both affect the same risk pools and are generally subject to the same regulations. If you're trying to compare to other providers, it is important to clarify definitions to ensure that the comparison is an apple-to-apples one. Now, let's discuss our Q3 performance. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a solid quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of $439 million. For U.S. dialysis, our normalized non-acquired growth for quarter was 4.4%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. While we're on the topic of volume, we want to share that we signed an amendment to the agreement of Renal Ventures to acquire 100% interest in their dialysis centers for $360 million, which is $55 million less than previously announced purchase price. We expect the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2017. Our revenue per treatment was up sequentially by $1.72 per treatment, primarily driven by an increase in seasonal administration of flu vaccine. Our patient care cost per treatment were up versus Q2 by $2.41 per treatment, driven by two primary factors : approximately 60% by an increase in labor and benefits costs; and 40% by an increase in facility cost. We've seen a tightening in labor markets leading to some increase in our labor costs. In the near term, we may see these labor costs remain at higher levels. We expect that our facility cost to come down over the next couple of quarters. Now, on to our outlook. Since we have now visibility to the end of the year, we're updating our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion. We'll provide you with 2017 guidance on our Q4 earnings call, when we expect to have additional clarity on several variables, including open enrollment and policy changes from CMS. Now, I'll turn the call to Vijay Kotte for DMG. Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we would see accelerated non-cash amortization expense for the HCP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 months at an incremental rate of slightly more than $2 million per month or $26 million on an annualized basis, beginning September 2016. Including the impact of this accelerated amortization, operating income for the quarter was $33 million. As we look at the full year, we're narrowing our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $115 million to $145 million. This is effectively a slight increase, as our guidance now includes the impact of the $9 million in accelerated brand amortization that was previously excluded. A natural question is how to think about 2017. We're still in the midst of our budget process and open enrollment plays a big part in our outlook. That being said, there are some things we know. First, $40 million in rate cuts, which includes $30 million related to the Medicare model change and $10 million for Medicaid. Second, we have the $26 million of accelerated brand amortization. And third, we're continuing to make incremental investments in the business. Despite these headwinds, the odds are that we'll be roughly flat year-over-year, but there are reasonable probabilities on either side of that. We will go into further detail regarding our expectation for 2017 on the Q4 earnings call. As we continue to look towards our long-term OI, our 2019 target remain $250 million. Finally, I want to provide a few highlights on the operating progress we're making at DMG. With regard to claims process, without the need for manual intervention : 2015 we're 26%; and in 2016 79%. With regard to services getting electronic authorizations : 2015 was 24%; 2016 is 47%. And finally, with regard to new tuck- in clinicians : in 2015 we had 18; and in 2016 we're at 44. Now, to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which includes the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million. We're on track to meet our guidance for approximately $40 million in adjusted losses for 2016. Our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui closed on August 1st. As you will recall, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership of the joint venture. At closing, each partner made their first investment tranche of $50 million in return for a 6.7% ownership in the joint venture. This joint venture has been deconsolidated from our financials. Going forward, our pro rata share of its operating income will run through equity investment income in our income statement. As a result of this deconsolidation, we recorded a one-time non-cash gain of $374 million. We are excluding this gain when reporting our adjusted non-GAAP financial results and excluding it from our adjusted operating guidance for 2016. We look forward to continuing our growth in Asia Pacific dialysis with the help of our new partners. Next, I'd like to talk about a few tax items. In the third quarter, we recorded an adjustment related to tax assets created through the DMG acquisition escrow provisions. This adjustment resulted in a $27 million increase in corporate G&A expense that was offset by an equal reduction in income tax expense, and thus created no change in net earnings or earnings per share. We do not expect any ongoing impact from this adjustment. Excluding this escrow provision tax adjustment and excluding the gain from the formation of the APAC dialysis joint venture, our tax rate attributable to DaVita was 40% in the quarter and 39% year-to-date. We expect our full-year tax rate attributable to DaVita to be approximately 39% when excluding all non-GAAP items. Next, our interest expense increased slightly in the quarter to $105 million due to an increase in the interest rate cap amortization, as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of the APAC joint venture. This higher level of interest expense reflects our go-forward run rate. And finally, turning to our continued strong and consistent cash generation. Operating cash flow was $536 million in the third quarter and $1.92 billion for the last 12 months. We expect full-year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion. Since, our last earnings release, we've repurchased 9.6 million shares for approximately $619 million. And through October, we have repurchased 13.3 million DaVita shares for approximately $868 million, which represents about 6.3% of the outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Approximately $881 million remains outstanding under our board repurchase authorizations. We continue to have a strong cash balance with nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 30th. While $212 million was used in October to repurchase stock and additional $360 million will be used in the coming months for the completion of the Renal Ventures acquisition, that still leaves us with over $1 billion of cash available before considering our continued strong cash generating capabilities. As discussed at our Capital Markets Day earlier this year, we expect to generate well over $5 billion in free cash flow to use for growth and share repurchases from 2016 to 2019. Even assuming a reasonable baseline of $1.5 billion in growth spending for development CapEx and acquisitions, this leaves over $3 billion for additional growth or share repurchase. And now, I'd like to turn it back to Kent for a few closing comments. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. And I'd actually like to make several additional comments. Some will be a little bit redundant to what JR said, but it's such an important topic we think it's worthwhile in order to achieve good clarity. Allow me eight different points, please. Number one, we fulfilled our regulatory responsibility to provide comprehensive education to our patients. This has been an industry requirement for the last 15 years to 20 years; and then, ACA was added onto that standard in longstanding process and practice. Number two, a very small percentage of our Medicaid patients determined that an ACA plan was better for them. And Javier mentioned some of the very significant reasons why some of those plans were way better for them and/or their families. I won't repeat the examples, but important and often beautiful improvements in care. Number three, nonetheless, if you look at the benchmark plan, an EGHP plan, you see that total ESRD costs \u2013 meaning, dialysis and hospital-related costs, et cetera \u2013 was about 1.3% of the total medical cost. That again is, total ESRD costs in the numerator and then total medical costs for the plan in the denominator. In the ACA plans, we estimate right now that that percentage is only up to about 1.6%. And so, it is a low absolute number and it's a low increase number. Number four, we were very sensitive to the fact that some of these patients choosing an ACA plan meant that we would be paid higher rates \u2013 commercial rates versus Medicaid rates. And, therefore, we created a very intense oversight process to make sure that we did everything possible to live up to the CMS standards around objective presentation of information and absolutely letting the patient choose. Number five, we, nonetheless, got swept up in the current huge controversies around the sustainability of the exchanges; and you're all sensitive to the huge political forces in play on that subject. Number six, why did dialysis and in part DaVita become a visible part of that controversy? Well, A, \u2013 letter A \u2013 we're national and so our numbers get added up nationally unlike a lot of health systems which are regional or local; B, our patients stick out. They're very high cost, very easy to identify, very discrete; C, there have been abuses by providers in other segments and perhaps some abuses even in ESRD. And so upfront, we started to be painted with that brush by some without data to support. D, some payers did have very large year-over-year increases in dialysis expense, and it was originally assumed that this must be from the process that I described earlier. But in fact, in many, probably most instances, it was driven by other factors. For example, sometimes a plan had a differentially attractive product and would gain significant market share, literally moving from having 50% of the ESRD patients in the market to 80%, thereby guaranteeing at least a 60% increase in your cost having nothing to do with anything else other than product design. As we all know, this has been a very dynamic period, probably the most dynamic period ever in terms of alternative product design for insurance plans; and also, people have been struck by how smart the consumers are and how much shopping and switching they do. A second explainer in several markets is when there was a bad actor in the payer world; meaning, someone who did inappropriate steering of patients away from themselves, leaving one of their competitors with a disproportionate percentage. And, again, we're talking about 30%, 40% shifts in market share in some instances. A third driver \u2013 out of probably a potential list of seven or eight, but I'll stop after three \u2013 is areas with relatively poor Medicaid coverage, because that would naturally mean that there is a higher probability that a Medicaid patient would find an ACA plan more attractive. This is just to give you a sense of what kind of things actually drove a lot of those year-over-year increases for particular plans. Because, as we mentioned earlier, the aggregate reality only moved from 1.3% to 1.6%. But letter E, those high examples were taken to CMS and positioned as being reasonably representative of a broader movement. And at that point, CMS did not have the data of the 1.3% and the 1.6%. On to number seven, of eight. CMS is now starting to realize, contrary to initial impressions, that, A, some of the numbers were misleading. That's not to say they were inaccurate if they were from a particular plan. They were just misleading. And as you start to stare at a number like a 0.3% increase \u2013 and again, this is our estimate \u2013 but as you compare that to 22% rate increases on average, you can see that we were not a material source of the problem, nor are we a material source of the solution. Letter B, our patients made sensible choices, and we've provided lots of examples to CMS as have other providers; C, the fact that enrollment of dialysis patients within the ACA plans looks to be flat or down, even without any change in Medicaid access in 2017 and 2018 and, of course, would be down even more with any restriction on the Medicaid front. Letter D, CMS now is starting to see some of the reasons for the dramatic disparities in year-over-year dialysis expense increases, and seeing how they have to do with product design, competition, et cetera. And lastly, E, they also have a better sense of how charitable premium assistance has been embedded in the ESRD economic and clinical ecosystem for 20 years, with a lot of guardrails and with the OIG's blessing, including blessing the aspect of provider funding. So number eight, and final comment is, of course, the big question on everyone's mind including ours is what exactly is CMS going to decide with respect to this portfolio of decisions. And we don't know. No one knows. I think to their credit, they don't know right now, because they're continuing to absorb information; and we are incredibly grateful and respectful that they are doing that. Moving onto DMG, just one happy announcement, and that is that Chuck Berg is joining our leadership team as Executive Chair of the DaVita Medical Group. He'll report to me in my role as CEO of the enterprise. Chuck's been on our board since 2007. He has a wealth of experience in the health plan world, including having been the very successful Executive Chair of WellCare Health Plans; and prior to that, the CEO of Oxford Health Plans, where I was his non-Executive Chair. This experience, combined with his brain, makes him uniquely suited to help us evaluate our long-term strategic alternatives at DMG. And he will remain in our board in the meantime, and I and others look forward to working with him. Operator, if you could please go ahead and open up the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good evening. I guess, my first question here is just the company bought back $600 million of stock in the last four months at prices that are 15% above the current price with full knowledge of the issues out there in terms of the concerns around third-party payment for ACA coverage, right, given the potentially significant impact on earnings here, the downstream impacts of just the government taking a harder look at third-party funding in general, managed care negotiations, et cetera, potentially getting impacted. My question is, should we take this as a sign of your comfort level with the potential downstream impacts on third-party payment changes, et cetera, one the earnings power of the business? And if so, any color you could share on why your level of comfort is that high, would be helpful? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Justin. I would not say that the reason we chose to buyback was because of any particularly distinctive level of confidence and what exactly the outcome was going to be. And certainly, if we could do it over again, we would've preferred to have waited than be buying back more now. But awfully difficult to predict things. A lot of different variables, not only with respect to the issues you mentioned, but other issues, both threats and opportunities. And, nonetheless, I would not say that we said, gosh, there is some distinctive near-term downside and we're going to go ahead and buy anyway. I wouldn't make that claim. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Then, maybe we could just talk about your commercial mix in general, given this has been a big area of focus here. If we look at the changes in the growth and in the commercial mix and if we back out these 2,000 patients, it looks like it's been flat over the last several years. But looking ahead and just thinking about the changes, looks like from USRDS data, there hasn't really been much incidence growth in the pre-65 population over the last 10 years. And when we couple that with the aging of the baby boomers in the Medicare from kind of commercial years, there is the indication that it could put a fair amount of pressure on commercial mix over time. So, I guess my question is, can you tell me whether this is a reasonable view? And if so, how should we think about this factor in relation to your typical kind of mid-single digit long-term growth algorithm for the dialysis? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's a very fair question, Justin. And I think if you wanted to identify other worrisome long-term trends, you would also look at improved treatment regimens for diabetics and hypertensives. And commercial patients are more likely to benefit from improved treatment regimens. On the other hand, there's also things pushing in the other direction. We continue to be quite successful with our non-acquired growth. And some of these hard times could lead a lot more small providers to sell or even shutdown. In addition, we're very hopeful that Medicare Advantage continues to grow, because we radically prefer a customer who cares about total value; and we tend to do much better in terms of both adding value to the system and getting reimbursed for it. In addition, as you know better than most, to the extent the mix ever starts to put too much pressure on all the independent centers, the government has the easy option of doing that which it's done three or four times before. And that's extending the MSP provision from originally zero to 12 months, then 12 months to 18 months, then 18 months to 30 months. And so, that's a safety valve that's never far away. Justin? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. Kent, if you can you give me one more chance. I'll just ask you like, does this mean that should we think about within the 6%, let's just call it, mid-single digit CAGR that you look for the dialysis business, this mix looks like just the \u2013 the likely pressure that's going to be on commercial mix over the next 10 years to 20 years, is this in that number or could this have a negative impact on that number in the way you're looking at it? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Fair question. I would say that at the time we did the last Capital Markets, we incorporated all variables, although that was a three-year outlook. When we refreshed our Capital Markets' outlook at the next one, it will once again incorporate everything. And while some of the stuff that you're citing is most likely not going to be economically material within the near-term, perhaps we should, for the first time in a long time, take a cut at sort of the four-year to seven-year timeframe and stare at some of the upsides and downsides, the puts and takes, not only on mix, but on cost structure, et cetera, also modality mix and some other things that can have a big impact on cash flow and return on capital. So we don't have anything distinctively thoughtful to say to you today from an analytical point of view, but that's probably a good assignment for the next Capital Markets. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thanks, guys. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Justin. Operator : Our next question is coming from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin, your line is now open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. I have a lot of questions kind of similar to that. But I guess, I appreciate all the color about the AKF change. I think that was very helpful and I think I understand those parameters. But, I guess, the question that I'm still struggling with is what the real growth rate of the company has been over the past three years in the dialysis business? Because if I look at operating income growth over the last three years, it's been about 5% per year. But if I was to say that this $140 million was either not sustainable or one-time in nature, then I get more like a 2% type growth in the dialysis business over the past three years. So how do we think about \u2013 and that's the low-end of what you guys think you're going to do over the next few years going forward. And when I think about the next few years versus last few years, Medicare rates have been under pressure and likely will be in the same range. So why is the right way to think about growth over the next three years not the low-end of that 2% to 7%, like what would cause you to do better than the low-end of that range, or is the low-end the right way to think about it? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Right now, I would say if you wanted to weight the probabilities between the low end, middle and top, you would find the probabilities skewed to the low-end. But it's not by a huge amount. And then, in addition of course unit volume is for us in many ways of secondary importance, with commercial mix and the nature of commercial mix of primary importance. And that number has got a lot of dynamism to it right now, as you well know. And so, at this point, we're not revising that guidance. But we do look forward to a very intense analytical discussion at the next Capital Markets about the next generation of three-year outlook. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, I guess if we look at commercial mix and take out this maybe 1% that's related to the ACA, it looks like mix has basically been flat over the last five years, maybe down a little bit, during a time when the economy is improving. So do you think that that's really reflective of what the industry has been seeing \u2013 or I know from time to time you've raised flags about potentially competitors getting aggressive on pricing. Has there been anything where you feel like you purposely walked away from market share, because it got competitive or is that kind of how you think mix overall for the industry has looked over that time period? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Our guess is that our trajectory of commercial mix is quite similar to others, and we have not experienced any example of someone in our mind foolishly seeking to gain share through price reductions in an industry of almost pure variable cost, very sticky volume, and high likelihood of economic retaliation. So we haven't seen any of that go on. And so, our guess is that competitor performance is comparable. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just one last question. On HCP, it looks like the number of physicians and clinicians was up nicely sequentially, but we still saw a deceleration in revenue in that business from Q2 to Q3. Wanted to see what maybe was going on there, whether the increase in clinicians was a good sign about a ramp-up in revenue over the next couple quarters? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Over the long-term, you should see a positive correlation. Right now, in some cases, we were understaffed with physicians; and by adding them, we actually think we can reduce our MLR at a quantity that exceeds the incremental costs that we're adding. In other cases, we're adding because we're doing some de novos and other work where we think by adding physician capacity we're going to get more lives. It's just that there is some lag time. So we're very sensitive to the fact that at a time when the revenue trajectory is what it is, our physician recruiting is ramping up. But the good news is that shows what an attractive place we are for physicians, that our hit rate and recruiting is very high. The concerning news for you is we're adding to cost at a time when revenues aren't going up at the same trajectory. And so, we hear you; and over time you should see the positive correlation you expect. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Is the right way to think about that as like a couple quarter lag or a year lag, how long do we think about these doctors adding to the earnings? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't think we're good enough yet to give you an empirical answer for that. And so, I won't hazard a guess. Suffice it to say, we know you'll be watching each quarter. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : You're right. Okay. Great. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question is coming from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just sticking with the topic of the day, I think there's a broader concern by some investors that potentially the AKF would be restricted more broadly from making premium support payments to historical patients that they would have been doing it for COBRA or for other factors. Can you talk about that? Do you think that is a risk and why or why not? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. It is a risk. But the two big facts on that big issue are that for private plans to do a broad prohibition of charitable premium assistance is an exceptionally heavy lift, because there are hundreds of such organizations all over the country and thousands of hospitals that like those foundations and charities and the rest. And to try to deploy one that's focused on our patients would be discriminatory and subject to really intense lawsuits. And then separately, CMS does not have authority over the whole EGHP realm. They of course have authority over lots of other realms, but not that one. Is that responsive, Gary? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. That's helpful. Any chance you could tell us what percentage of your commercial patients, if you know it, receive premium assistance from the AKF? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I think at this point, we've decided that disclosing that is not in your best interests, although we'll continue to stare at that each quarter, but that's our current thinking. Of course, we incorporate all variables into our forecasts, but sometimes some of these swing factors are difficult to calibrate. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, on the same topic, I think there are some investors that believe that in fact it's illegal for the Medicaid patients to have been given premium support. Can you just talk about that and your understanding. I assume from your perspective, it's not illegal. Can you just help us think through that? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. I appreciate you bringing it up, because we certainly heard the concern. And on this, the very explicit references by CMS to how it is legal are multiple and really clear. And the RFI referred to a part of the statutes that didn't apply to the subject at hand, so was literally not germane to the critical questions that you and others are worried about. And so, we have continued to point to the very explicit language supporting our position. We have been in meetings with senior CMS officials and referred to the fact that it's very clearly legal, and have never run into a single objection from anyone. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Gary, let me add one other thing, Gary, that might help clear it up. It is the case that Medicaid patients cannot have federal subsidies. And so, it's not that there aren't some rules that apply, but it is very clear that there was a conscious decision made to allow Medicaid patients to make the choices that we made available to them. And I'll even add one other element. Back when the Affordable Care Act was being rolled out, we were encouraged by the administration to promote exchange products. We were even asked to put up signs in our centers promoting the ACA plans. Now, of course, it's four years later and a lot of things have changed, but that's the actual historical context. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. That's very helpful. And then, Jim, can you just remind us at what point you would've been restricted from purchasing your stock after the end of the quarter? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Well, we typically are in a restriction period near the very end of the quarter, and we would be restricted throughout the period of time after the quarter ended, until through this call. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. But I thought you guys did in fact purchase some stock after the end of the quarter? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. We did, and that was subject to a plan... Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: ...that we've put in place before we were blacked out. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So you had a 10b-5 in place before it was blacked out? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: That's correct. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Just wanted to again come back to the AKF issue. Obviously, you're pointing at $140 million of OI this year as in that being the potential headwind for next year. But can you give us a sense for how that ramped during the first two years of the coverage expansions? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: How the $140 million ramped up? Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Like, what was the exposure in 2014, and then in 2015, and now you're at a $140 million for this year in roughly 2,000-ish patients? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. I know we didn't calculate that number prior to the call, why don't \u2013 the people around the table here will see if we can and should generate that and share it before the call is over, but we don't have it at our finger tips. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then, sort of another qualitative type question here on the AKF issue. But obviously getting to some of the \u2013 at least what's been sort of suggested from the managed care side is that by shifting some of these people from, call it, a 100% Medicaid to sort of Medicaid as a supplemental, there may have been some out-of-pocket exposure here. I guess, when you new guys did you look back and reviewed the 2,000 or whatever that may have been in 2015 and 2014, what did you do? I guess, I'm just trying to get some comfort here that you guys feel pretty comfortable that in no material way were the individuals harmed financially? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I'll take a first stab, and then other people may want to add on. First of all, we dedicated a huge amount of time in developing materials and training our people, and so that historic discipline of presenting objectively was on steroids for this process. And we present very complete information that encompasses premiums, deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket stuff, potential federal tax credits, potential charitable premium assistance, individual versus family, high income versus low. And so, we're thorough and it's presented to the patients in ways that leaves most of them exceptionally grateful for the help and the clarity; and then, they chose. So one can never say that theoretically you couldn't have a patient chose something that was foolish. I'm sure, out of 2,000 patients there were some, but we have to respect the fact that it's their choice. In general, however, just as we've seen in the exchanges over the last three years or four years, the average patient demonstrates a lot of economic common sense in how they move around between different products, particularly when they're helped. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: And, Chris, this is Javier. I'll just add one important point is that they never lose their Medicaid. Medicaid was in a secondary position. So the patients actually didn't incur additional costs. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, okay. And then, just one last one here on Kidney Care operating income for next year. You made reference in the Monday press release that there could be some theoretical offsets to the $140 million. If there are, can you give us a sense for what they are? And then, just can you just give us some general sort of headwinds and tailwinds beyond the AKF issue? Thanks a lot. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, first of all, on mitigation, we'll be able to do a good job on that the next quarterly call if we're in the scenario where that's the topic of the day. Separate from that, and then someone else may want to add, I mean on the plus side we have a wonderful recurring unit growth. We have the potential accelerator of continued Medicare Advantage growth. On the cost structure side, we have the opportunities in the ESA area. And on the capital deployment side, we have the opportunity for more small operators feeling a need to get out of this evermore complicated and challenging business. On the headwind side, I think, we've laid them out with painful detail already, and so I won't list them again. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks a lot. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Chris. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Ransom of Raymond James. John, your line is now open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. I did one day of law school and ran out in horror, so my pea brain isn't wired to understand all these fine points. But to make it simple, one of your competitors said that the no-no in their opinion was to switch people off of Medicaid, but the ambiguity was when a new patient came in, eligible for both Medicaid and an ACA plan, that's where you could present both. Is what you're doing just sort of in line with that that new patients come in are fair game, they don't have insurance, but existing patients on Medicaid you're no longer going to try to switch them. I know I'm oversimplifying, but is that a helpful way to think about it or no? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: Hey, it's LeAnne. I think you're confusing two things. So let's talk about \u2013 patients who signed up for ACA coverage made that choice and retained their Medicaid in the secondary. I think that answers the first question. We're not substituting ACA coverage for Medicaid. If they're keeping them, they're having both of them and it's not subsidized by federal tax credits. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Does that answer just the first half of your question, John? John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Well, not really, but I'll follow up. There are so many crosscurrents here, I don't want to drag this out on the call. And what about the second scenario where a patient comes in without any \u2013 maybe they are eligible for Medicaid, but they just never signed up. How does that work? And is that something \u2013 again, your competitor said we expect CMS to clarify the rules on that patient B that comes in without any insurance at all. Is that a useful way or again was that a misleading comment by one of your competitors? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: No. I think we do have patients that come to us that are uninsured. And our education and process with those patients would be to find out all the avenues to which they could purchase coverage, whether they be Medicare or Medicaid, a commercial plan, an ACA plan, et cetera. So our counselor's job is to make sure that each of the avenues is presented to that patient, and then the patient chooses what is best for them in their particular circumstance. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. LeAnne, hadn't heard from you a while, so it's good to hear your voice. The second question I had was, I mean, obviously in some of the comments \u2013 there were allegedly comments from either current or former DaVita employees who talked about being pressured to sign people up on commercial plans. So I'm sure you solved that stuff. Just internally, what kind of controls do you have in place to investigate those kinds of comments? And what's your general view on that true, not true, out of context or \u2013 that'd be helpful? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: John, thank you. This is Javier. First of all, I would like to highlight that the numbers are small. But, of course, regardless of the size of the numbers, we take each and everyone very seriously. We did some huge, huge oversight here. We had to train a lot of people in a very short amount of time. And so, we had heavy oversight and for a small number of people, they might have experienced that as negative. What we do is, of course, if we have any concerns, we give it to a third-party, we give it to our compliance department and they looking to it, and we rectify if there are any mistakes. But the bulk of what we've looked into has now materialized. And actually, when we've gone into some sessions, we've literally asked for evidence to be provided of our wrongdoing and \u2013 alleged wrongdoing and we've never have been given any specifics, because, of course, we would want to correct any mistakes if they were brought to our attention. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And then let's switch gears, and two more quick ones. Let's say, we are in a scenario of a little more austerity on a number of fronts. I mean, there is obviously a big gap between your total CapEx and your maintenance CapEx. In a more austere scenario, and I'll just make up a number, let's say, revenue per treatment is $340 to $345 for a bunch of reasons, how should we think about the likely reaction of the company? What levers would be likely to be pulled? And, again, CapEx is one that \u2013 would appear to be one where you have a lot of this discretion over? And, again, I asked this because there is a debate on the Street about should we look at DaVita on earnings per share or we should look at it on free cash flow? And free cash flow requires the assumption that CapEx is closer to maintenance than it is to actual? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. We hear you. The answer right now would be fairly generic. I mean, in a world where we would suffer some serious revenue compression we would do what any responsible business person should do, and very systematically go through every line item on the P&L and every aspect of cash in and cash out. And we would enter into that process with the expectation that we would find some savings in the P&L side, and we would find some reductions on the CapEx side. And at the same time, we haven't quantified those, but we certainly do have some serious ranges of discretion. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Was the reduction in price for Renal Ventures driven by the new thinking around ACA plans or was it something else? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: No. It was something else. There is a part of the transaction that was contemplated at the beginning. And after further dialogue, we are not going to acquire their infusion business. So that's why the price was changed. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I see. You still think you might get that done. I know it's been dragging on for over a year, is that still to be done by the end of the year. Or maybe you never said, but that's our assumption. Is that a reasonable assumption? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: No. There is some chance of Q4. But if you were betting, I would probably go with Q1, because there is some regulatory stuff going on. So I think Q1 is... John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: 18 months, is that a record? I will think 18 months might be a record. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: It is. It's a new record for us anyway. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And lastly, just thinking about potential good guys, ESA costs. Do you have a view of \u2013 you've got your current contract with Amgen obviously. But if you do a market check on what other folks are now paying for ESAs, what's your view on your kind of apples-to-apples costs versus what's currently \u2013 if you were free of that contract, would that be a good guy that could be called out? Thanks. And I'll stop there. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, it's LeAnne again. I think you have to put it into two buckets. Obviously, I think the public announcement by FMC as to their cost reductions associated with their using Mircera gives you one category. So clearly, I think they are enjoying their prices better than the rest of the marketplace. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: Then you take the rest of the marketplace that's on Amgen products. And I think there was a lot of buzz about the move to Aranesp lowered the independent and small providers cost. Well, that's correct. It did. But that's a relative lowering and our ESA cost has been historically the best. And I think that holds true. And so, if you want to ask it again in a different way, but I think that should give you the answer you're looking for. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, in short, probably unless somebody opens up that contract, it's probably reasonable to assume not much movement on that line item through the terms of the contract? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: I don't know if that's necessarily the right conclusion. Of course, when you enter into a long-term contract, both parties will look into it as things change. Amgen, of course, is interested in seeing that we are a customer post-contract renewal, and we want to be talking to all the parties that are out there. And so, what we're trying to make sure is that we have the right term solution for the long haul. So we're looking at this. You seldom get a chance to look at an $800 million cost line. And so, we are very eager in deploying the right level of rigor and resources to make sure that we get the right relationship going forward post-2018. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks so much. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, John. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: And I've got an answer for the question that Chris brought up, which is sort of this $140 million, how did it build over time. It won't be very precise, but it will give you directionally what you're seeking. And that is that the bulk of the growth came in 2015 and 2016. 2014, it was a small number, if we had to estimate in the $20 million or so range. In 2015, the range is probably somewhere in the \u2013 I don't know, double that, give or take. We don't have very precise numbers, but we just wanted to give you directionally that the bulk of it was in 2016, with some growth in 2015. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay operator. Operator : Our next question is coming from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Gary, your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. Just a couple of things. Given some of the reports that some of the health plans have already attempted to identify patients with AKF subsidies and even potentially terminate some of the contracts, I just wanted to check in on commercial mix. I know you disclose it annually, not quarterly. But I do think last quarter you did acknowledge that it was still trending higher year-over-year. So I wanted to see if that was still true for 3Q 2016 versus 3Q 2015? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry. Gary, your question is commercial mix, what period to what period? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Q3... Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just year-over-year in the third quarter, is it still trending higher year-over-year in the third quarter? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: It is. It is up year-on-year, Gary. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And sequentially probably hasn't done a lot, is that fair? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: We've seen it go down slightly in the last quarter. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then back to Renal Ventures, is that still ballpark, 2,300 patients to 2,400 patients and then anticipating some divestitures, is that still ballpark? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. And then, I just want to go to the patient care costs, which you called out. And I think you talked about 60% labor, 40% facility cost, but that was in the context of the couple dollar sequential change given that ESRD OI was down year-over-year and the cost jumped about $6 year-over-year. Would that still be the same ratio if I look at the year-over-year that more than half of that's labor and the rest is facility costs? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And when you say facility cost, you said it was coming down, what exactly is driving that up temporarily? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: It was a bunch of miscellaneous line items, none of them particularly stick out. So it would just be giving you a very long list, and it just cumulatively added up to something this time. And so, we're working on it. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Last question. I believe you were talking about HCP's OI potentially being flat into 2017 and you made no comments on consolidated or Kidney and I just wanted to confirm that that was correct? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. That's correct. We'll be providing guidance on 2017 in the next quarterly call for U.S. Kidney Care. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Whit Mayo of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Hey, thanks. I'll try to keep it quick, but maybe one more on the AKF. It doesn't appear that you implemented this exchange initiative until 2015 at least according to the RFI submission. So, one, just looking to confirm that? And the ACA obviously was implemented in 2014 and you knew about it many years prior. So was there something that made you apprehensive about pursuing this strategy with patients and why perhaps it wasn't implemented in 2013 or 2014 open enrollment? Just looking for any additional color. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: There was no conscious delay on our part. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, maybe just one last one with the MA STAR ratings published. How would you characterize how your health plan partners are positioned next year? And what do you think this means for DMG, and maybe the conclusion when you look at scores like Humana's? Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. This is Vijay. Just to be clear, the 2017 numbers are already fixed, right. So we don't see much of a change between 2016 and 2017. The Humana numbers were for payment year of 2018. And the only place where we saw a potential drop was in one market. And as you know, the STAR scores are related to a number of factors, but our clinical quality was that of four star and above. And we believe that in partnering with our health plans there are some administrative opportunities to help neutralize some of the impact of the potential hit for 2018 for Humana in that one market. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Well, that's it. We're past the hour mark. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, feel free to ask another question if you'd like. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No. I'm good, Kent. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Patrick Wood of Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Perfect. Thank you very much for agreeing to squeeze me in at the end. I'll be very quick, and this should be fairly yes or no sort of small questions. I have three, if I may. The first would be, I was very interested to hear about the apples-to-apples comparison in terms of patient numbers in relation to the CMS RFI submission. I'd be curious to hear what you guys think is an apples-to-apples number vis-\u00e0-vis what your competitors submitted, I'd be very curious to hear that? Equally, second question would be, when I backed off from your operating income sort of impact, you guys currently gave us the $140 million, I get to about $715 or so revenue implied per treatment for the exchange funds. Is that a fair kind of back out or is there other noise in that that means that revenue per treatment number that I got it wrong somehow? And then, finally, I'd be very curious to hear of your commercial business, what percentage do you guys feel is out-of-network, would be very helpful? Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: So let me tackle number one and number three, and then someone else can take a stab at number two. On out-of-network, we don't disclose exact percentages, but we've successfully dramatically reduced that number over the last five years. And strategically and from a relationship point of view, we much prefer to be in network. And at the same time, of course, the peers got to make a reasonable offer for that tradeoff. And so, that's the answer on out-of-network. On the patient count issue, the apples-to-apples issue, all we know is our number and our definition \u2013 and we provided we think the right definition for you to be able to assess the economics associated with this issue. And then if other competitors slice and dice it in different ways, we can't really opine on that. You'll have to really talk to them about why they think it's the right way to do that. Hopefully, we're pretty clear about why we think batching on and off exchanges is the right way to look at it for our shareholders at least. And then, on the second one, can somebody? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. On the implied revenue per treatment, you're about right. And, of course, there is discrepancies geographically, and by payer, and product mix, et cetera. But yes, you are in the ZIP code. Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: That's absolutely fantastic. Thank you very much for your help, guys. Operator : Our last question is coming from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks for letting me back in for one more. I wanted to touch on the \u2013 I think the people are trying to figure out the other $90 million of potential pressure here. And so, I just wanted to walk through, is there any way to think about where those patients came from? Specifically, you've got 3,000 patients that are on ACA, about half of them are getting AKF assistance. I assume it's a lot less likely that CMS does something to stop people who came to you with commercial to keep what they have, or having AKF help them keep what they have, versus maybe those that come to you uninsured and are just waiting for the three-month Medicare period maybe CMS steps in on that. Is there some way to think about that $90 million and how to think about the risk and maybe break it down to those two pools, keep what you have versus uninsured? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Let me take a little bit of a stab here, Justin, but I'm not sure if we're going to be able to give you what you want. In total, there is kind of three buckets. There is the Medicaid bucket, which of course is getting a huge amount of attention and discussion. Then there are the uninsured, but that label is kind of misleading, because a very significant number of them came from state high-risk plans that shut down as part of the Affordable Care Act. So while they didn't have classic insurance, they were funded. And they were typically funded at rates more like commercial than Medicare or Medicaid. And so, for the system, there is no increase in cost from their emergence in the second bucket of ACA plans. And then the third bucket, which is substantial, our people who are on private plans before ACA existed, they had individual health insurance plans. And once ACA was there, they switched over. And so, these are people who've been buying insurance in the same way that everyone on this call buys insurance, only they're doing it individually as opposed to their employer. So those are the three buckets. And then within that second bucket, there are some subsets. But at some point, continued parsing and get to pretty small numbers. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So maybe I'll just ask the question this way and jump off. There are people that are going to come to you that are uninsured that can qualify for Medicare after three months. If I were thinking about the potential risk bucket here, that would be the one where potentially now you're signing up for ACA plans, where before they would just have to wait three months uninsured and get Medicare. Is there any way to think just about how CMS \u2013 could CMS address that, or effectively they're uninsured and they can buy an ACA plan like anybody else. So how do you stop it? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. I mean, just looked around the table. I don't have an answer to that. Does anybody? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: Well, Justin, if I understand you correctly, I think what we're having a little disconnect in the room is, we have a population that does not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid because they haven't worked in a requisite number of quarters; or even if you are here and working through the Visa process, you have to wait five years before you're eligible for Medicare. So, I think, there is a genuine population when we discuss, but that cannot access the government coverage. Does that explain it for you? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. So you're saying there is not really much of this 3,000 population that just had to wait three months for Medicare before and is now getting ACA? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Right. He's specifically asking \u2013 yeah. I hear you, Justin. You're specifically asking about that three-month waiting period and is there anybody... Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Correct. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: ...is anything going on there. I think, Justin, we'll have to get back to you and the rest of the shareholders on that because that's not a question that I've heard asked and answered. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Appreciate the time. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. And thanks, everyone, for your sustained interest. And we'll look forward to talking to you on all these topics in 90 days. Thank you. Operator : And that ends today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

LLC Operator : Welcome and thank you, for standing by. At this time, all participants will be on listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jim Gustafson. You may begin. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Daisy, and welcome, everyone, for our fourth quarter conference call. I appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thanks, everyone for joining our call. We will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are first and foremost a clinical enterprise. Within the DaVita Medical Group, we had great news on our star ratings most of you are familiar with that. If you think about it, we have six main markets and there are nine key star measures, so a total of 54 cells in that grid, and 31 of those 54 cells, we have a five-star rating, that's 57%, and 47 of the 54 categories are either a four or a five, 87%. Those are our best results ever and we doubt that any other multimarket set of medical groups can match them. So, very proud of that. Within Kidney Care, CMS recently released the results of the ESRD quality incentive program, which is called QIP, we significantly outperform the industry for the fourth year in a row. Our penalty percentage was about 50% less than the rest of the industry, so a very large difference. And we, as always, remain big supporters of the transparency in both the quality incentive program and the five-star programs in both DaVita Kidney Care and DaVita Medical Group. Now, I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. I'm going to jump right in, because I have a lot to cover. Our adjusted operating income was $423 million for the quarter on relatively flat U.S. dialysis revenue and patient care costs per treatment, resulting in an adjusted operating income of $1.715 billion for 2016, which is near the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided last quarter of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion. Now, I'm going to shift to provide some details on our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion, which we first provided in January. I'm going to cover four headwinds and two tailwinds in depth. Let's start with the headwinds. First, the early results from open enrollment indicate that the number of dialysis patients covered in ACA plans for 2017 will be down significantly year-over-year, consistent with what we have previously disclosed. This decline appears to be driven by changes in plan design, loss of plan choices in certain markets and disruption generally in the market, including the impact of the interim final rule. As you know, the federal court issued an injunction, which prevented the rule from being enacted, concluding that the rule was arbitrary and capricious. In fact, the judge found material fault with both the process and content with the IFR, indicating that significant harm would be done to thousands of patients if the rule had been implemented. While this was a big victory for dialysis patients, in general, we still estimate that the earning impact from the overall loss of enrollment will be consistent with what we had previously disclosed at approximately $230 million. On to the second headwind, like other healthcare providers, we've been experiencing wage inflation and turnover that is higher than our historical rates. Clinical teammates costs represent our largest expense. So even a small change in these costs are impactful. Third as Kent mentioned earlier this year, our guidance range incorporates known and forecasted rate decreases. To try and be helpful. I'll ask and answer questions that I would have if I was in your roles. First, has something structurally changed in our core business? The answer is, no. Are there more contracts than usual up for renewal this year? The answer is, no. Has leverage with payers changed? The answer is, no. They have always been formidable negotiators. Well, then if all this is true, why are you experiencing rate reductions? The answer is that the political dynamics and the intensity of the conversation surrounding charitable premium assistance increased the scrutiny on ESRD rates. And in a subset of our situations, we felt that it was appropriate to respond when the rates were unusually high in exchange for long-term sustainable agreements. The last question I'll ask myself on this topic is, how should we think about the future? Unfortunately, I can't provide much help here. It's hard to speculate in timeframes beyond 2017, and, as has been the case for the past decade, we remain focused on negotiating agreements at long-term sustainable rates and attractive terms. The last headwind I will discuss is that we expect significant decreases in operational income in our pharmacy business in 2017, as a result of several factors impacting rates, volume and cost. Now, let's shift on to the tailwinds. The first, as we disclosed in January, we signed a new supply agreement with Amgen. We entered into a six-year deal that provides for substantial savings starting in 2017, however, the specific terms including pricing are confidential. Secondly, historically, we have had a profit share program in lieu of a traditional 401(k) match, and we're now switching to a 401(k) match effective in 2018. The net effect of this change is a one-time expense pick-up in 2017 of approximately $100 million just due to the timing of the accruals. Please keep in mind that this will create an additional expense when comparing 2018 to 2017, because we will begin to accrue for a 401(k) match in 2018. The aggregation of this is unfortunately \u2013 the net results of all these factors is that year-over-year we will have a decline of adjusted operating income of approximately $140 million at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance includes the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but there are scenarios where we could be higher and lower. Please note that we do not expect the operational income to be distributed evenly throughout the year due to several reasons, two of which are normal season factors, so for example, there are two fear treatment days in the first quarter compared to Q4, and one fear treatment day compared to Q1 of 2016. And secondly, there are seasonally higher payroll taxes in Q1. As for the outlook, Kent will discuss this in his closing comments. So, now, I'll hand it over to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG. Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Javier. DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million. This includes approximately $7 million of non-cash accelerated amortization expense for our transition to the DMG brand as noted on our previous earnings call. As a reminder, this accelerated amortization began in September 2016 and will run for 30 months at a rate of approximately $2.2 million per month. In terms of the full-year, we ended 2016 with an adjusted operating income of $135 million, which places us slightly above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range. This includes approximately $9 million of incremental amortization expense related to rebranding for the year. Turning next to our expectations for 2017. We mentioned on our prior earnings call that we were anticipating 2017 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Based on the completion of our annual budget process and our review of open enrollment results, thus far, we believe this continues to be the case and are giving 2017 guidance of $110 million to $115 million. A natural question might be why we are only expecting relatively flat year-over-year performance. To answer that, I'd say that we expect continued operating improvement, but anticipate operating income to be relatively flat due to a few formidable headwinds. First, $40 million in rate cuts, $30 million of which are related to Medicare Advantage and $10 million in Medicaid. Second, $26 million of brand amortization expense, which is $17 million more than what we had in 2016. And third, incremental investments in the business that we expect will improve our performance downstream focused in three main areas : Number one, core infrastructure such as a new enterprise data warehouse. Number two, innovative new capabilities as we continue to build a differentiated medical group, including the development of telemedicine capabilities, which will allow us to engage patients face-to-face outside the walls of our clinics or check-in between office visits as well as mobile shot technology that will provide our clinicians safe, remote, critical patient data regardless of where they are. And then number three, expansion of existing population health capabilities into new markets, as we shift from fee-for-service to value. As you can see, staying flat in operating income masked some pretty strong operating performance improvement as we overcome these headwinds. Finally, as we look towards our long-term operating income, our 2019 target remained $215 million. Now, to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter, and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full-year. Q4 international equity earnings from our APAC JV benefited from a $7 million currency gain within the JV. However, this gain was largely offset by a $6 million currency loss reported in other income, which is reported below operating income. These results are better than our guidance of approximately $40 million in adjusted international losses in 2016. We expect international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017. Now, on to cash flow. In 2016, we generated strong operating cash flow of $1.96 billion, positively impacted by the timing of certain working capital items that will likely reverse in 2017. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 is $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. 2017 cash flow should be unusually high relative to adjusted operating income, primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the government payer settlement that we expect to receive in the first quarter. Next, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of our stock for $416 million. And for all of 2016, we deployed $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 16.6 million shares of our stock, which represents approximately 8% of our outstanding share count over the past year. Now, a few tax items of note. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower realized day tax rates and related true-ups. Our expected full-year tax rate attributable to DaVita in 2017 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%, excluding any non-GAAP items. And please note that DaVita like many other U.S.-centric healthcare service providers pays among the highest tax rates in corporate America. Now, over to Kent for a few closing comments. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I'd like to finish with just a few words on each of our businesses. In Kidney Care, we are in a period of greater policy uncertainties, and is the norm, if you look back over the last 10 years or so, not unique, but more than the norm. And so, while we expect a continuation of the positive operating performances we have had for several years, given the policy uncertainty, we could in fact do better or worse than the outlook that we've discussed today and earlier this year. The big and obvious reasons are all the uncertainties surrounding what the new administration and the new Congress will do with respect to the Affordable Care Act. In addition, we do know that despite the immensely favorable Federal Court ruling on the IFR, nonetheless the debate over what will happen with charitable premium assistance, not just in Kidney Care, but in all spheres of American healthcare. In addition to the debates about benefit, design, and benefit implementation, we'll continue to play out over the next couple of years as much as all of us would love clarity to emerge sooner. And it is worthwhile to note that there are also upsides embedded in this uncertainty with respect to issues like MSP, Medicare secondary provision, accelerating our patients' right to choose MA plans, the patient act enabling us to do global capitation in centers throughout the country et cetera. And as we often point to the Kidney Care platform in the United States remains very strong. The international business segment, we continue to grow at a good clip and progress towards reasonable scale and we continue to expect that we will breakeven in 2018 in international dialysis for our current footprint of countries, hopefully a platform emerging with a lot of downstream growth potential. And then lastly, the DaVita Medical Group, DMG, which has proven to be a remarkably resilient platform with capabilities improving each and every quarter at this point. You probably noted that without the non-cash amortization there would have been a nice uptick in our thoughts around the operating income trajectory. And in addition, there is growing MA support, Medicare Advantage support, in the administration and in Congress and we hope that translates into a better rate environment in the next few years than the very, very, very difficult one we've had the last few years. And lastly, at the enterprise level, we'll make the typical obvious, but nonetheless worth noting point that our cash flows are strong, steady and hopefully we've demonstrated reasonable thoughtfulness in how we've deployed that wonderful shareholder asset and we'll continue to do so. Operator, could we please open the line for Q&A? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment for our incoming questions. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Your line is open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the pricing headwind that you guys talked about. Is this an issue of out of network being pushed in network? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Short answer is, no. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then we think about then re-pricing some of your contracts that maybe were above average, is that something that you feel is now completely done or is the way that contract timing works, we might see additional pressure like this heading into 2018? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Kevin, what I would say is that we can't predict 2018. What we do know is that the climate and the landscape has changed, that with the new administration, with so many patients leaving the exchange, and therefore, having less dialysis patients than the benchmark, when the injunction relief, that right now, the landscape is materially different for 2018, and so while that does not mean we will win, we're back to a very balanced situation. Is that helpful? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. No, I think that makes some sense. And then, I guess if you could just \u2013 really wasn't clear to me exactly what's going on in the pharmacy business, what the headwinds are there? And when we think about the headwinds into 2017, is that something that is now in the numbers, or is that something that we should be expecting to pressure the business additionally in the future? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: I'll grab that one, Kevin. I'll probably be pretty redundant to what JR said, that there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there, unfortunately, largely negative. And so, without parsing it all out, it's a bunch of stuff that at the same time has hit rate, volume and cost, leading to the substantial decline that JR talked about. And it's conceivable that through the course of the year, we might actually even move into a loss situation for the first time in a long time, and we'll of course keep you posted on that. So, it was important enough for us to point to, and we'll keep you posted as we move through the year. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is that a business that you feel you need to be in strategically, or is that something that if it heads this direction, it becomes a loss that you could potentially get out of? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: From a strategic, and from a clinical, and from a mission perspective, we love the business. It does remarkable things for our patients' clinical outcomes, and the access and convenience, and support that they and their families so intensely need. Having said that, if you said that the premise was ever we're going to lose money forever, then we'd have to take a good hard look, but that's not our expectation and that's not our intention. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess, there's a lot of things going on there, so it might be hard to explain in a short period of time. But I guess, just any color that you can provide around that, just so that we now have a sense of whether we think this will get better or worse going forward, I guess, it's kind of vague, and I'm not sure how to think about it. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Maybe we'll go a little bit more in Capital Markets, because we never had to talk about it much and we had a couple very nice years there. And so, part of this is a drop from some really good things that happened that we didn't talk about because of the timing of the bad period we felt it important to cover that on this side. So, why don't we share more at Capital Markets? And in general, a material movement in profits for Rx, that starts to look pretty immaterial when you think of it just as a part of our Kidney Care offering overall. And so, we don't want to place an emphasis on it that's out of proportion to the actual absolute numbers. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That will be helpful. All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Tejus Ujjani. Your line is open. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Tejus Ujjani. Thanks for taking the question. How should we think about U.S. center growth going into 2017? And then also, can you remind us of your JV strategy? And also kind of a modeling question, I noticed the NCI stepped down a bit sequentially, any color there would be helpful? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Let me take the first part. The first part on our non-acquired growth in Kidney Care, we're going to be consistent to the range that we've highlighted on the 3.5% to 4.5%. And if you could repeat the second part of your question? Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sure. So, on your JV, you have joint ventures as well, so just curious kind of in 2017, will there be any change in kind of going after those opportunities as well? And then, kind of more remodeling question, I noticed that the non-controlling interest expense amount stepped down sequentially and year-over-year in this fourth quarter, I'm just curious kind of what drove that? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Got it. As it relates to going after JVs, we remained consistent in our philosophy there, which is, we really like the clinical value that a joint venture partner offers. So, that has not changed and we don't expect that to change. As it relates to the number, Jim's got an answer. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Tejus, the reason NCI dropped in the quarter was related to the goodwill impairment at one of our SIs, we took a $28 million impairment, there was $8 million related to that was impacted NCI. If you look in our non-GAAP reconciliation in the back of our earnings release, you can see the numbers. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake [Wolfe Research]. Your line is open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. [Technical Difficulty] (24:37-24:46)? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Hey Justin. Justin you were all garbled there the first 10 words or so. We couldn't hear them could you start over. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Sorry about that, I just said, I'm in airport. So, current pricing (24:59) pressure, can you tell us how much more patients you have at these higher rates that could be subject to pressure going forward, I know you can't predict it. But you did a similar amount that you still have these rates that you've already seen get re-priced or is it more or less? Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.: Well, it's less than before, given what happened. And I think it's \u2013 I don't think it's a good idea to sort of discuss the distribution curve. I mean there is always going to be one, of course, but it can have a different shape and ours has been very steadily becoming a tighter distribution curve over the last eight years, consistent with the strategy that we've expressed to you. So, unfortunately, we can't sit here and say that there is no downside going forward. Having said that, we just incurred a big chunk of it. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : And now last on Medicare Advantage, you noted the final (26:04) and your stars are improving, can you tell us what you think your rates could be for 2018? And how that might affect your DaVita Medical Group business? Thanks. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Justin, it's a little early for us at this point. As you know, there's a lot of variability between the advanced and the final notice. We've got some very high-level assumptions that have been put out, but the accounting level specifics are very important for us. So, it's way too early to tell and when we get more information, we'll let you all know. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman [Wells Fargo Securities]. Your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one housekeeping item. Jim, what was the share count at the end of the year? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: It's in our earnings release. Hang on. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sorry. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: Fully diluted, at the end of the quarter, that will average for the quarter was 196,743,187. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And what was at the absolute end of the year? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: We'll get back to you, though. We're... Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Yeah, that was the number I was looking for. Javier, you mentioned that the landscape you think was more balanced going in to 2018, given some of the recent events. Is there any chance that, that helps you at all in 2017 or is everything kind of locked and loaded for 2017 already? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Well, it's not locked and loaded. The probabilistic gives and takes embedded in the number that we gave you. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So, maybe it's not unreasonable, I think it might be a little bit better than initially thought? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: It could be a little better, it could be a little worse. In the name of the game, we try to be as constructive and productive as we can and give you as much as we can and that's what's embedded in our guidance. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. And then if we think about the total, the $230 million hit, the two buckets you broke it out into, was the Medicaid and the non-Medicaid. So, in future years given the court decision, is it possible that the non-Medicaid comes back? How should we think about the opportunity there? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. On the non-Medicaid, I doubt that it would come back. I would just \u2013 I would say no to that, although you never say no to anything nowadays, because everything is being questioned. And so, is that the bulk part of your question or is there something else in that? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, I think that's sort of the bulk of the question. And then maybe just to wrap up Kent, I think this is a question for you. You guys bought back a record amount of stock last year. I mean going into this year with EBIT expectations to be down for the first time in a while, there is a little bit of a dichotomy there, obviously, it sounds like you guys are pretty bullish on the business with the stock repurchase. So, can you maybe help reconcile that for us and what makes you so optimistic about the business going forward? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Gary, if you could clarify for me, where do you see the apparent contradiction? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well, just that you guys are obviously bullish about the business with the large stock repurchase, and the EBIT guidance for next year is down, which is not typically the case, so that sort of what I'm pointing out as maybe a little bit of a dichotomy? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I don't know if I quite think about it the same way, so that makes me stumble around here for a second, and see if it can be useful. As we accumulate cash, if we're not thinking that we've got the right business opportunities to invest in, there's a point at which we get someone uncomfortable, and usually a bunch of you do also with the amount. And then we do stare at the price of the stock, and we are not in the camp that some people are in, where they just say buybacks are \u2013 buyback decisions should be made totally independent of what the stock price is. We're not in that camp, nor do we think that we're excellent prognosticators of which way the stock moves as you can tell from a lot of the decisions we've made over time, whether it's stock buybacks, or option exercises, or whatever. So, we're appropriately humble in thinking about that, and there's always upside and downside. So, clearly, putting all that stuff together, and the fact that it didn't feel at all appropriate to use your money to pay down debt, we thought it was right to put the cash to work by buying back stock, put it to work for you rather than having it sit for a longer and longer period of time on our balance sheet. And of course, we didn't want to reduce our standards for making additional business investments. It is also the case that we think that while 2017 is going to be a very tough year compared to perhaps any year in memory that things are going to be better as we move forward out of 2017, it's not to say there isn't risk, but that's where we lean. So, is any of that helpful to you in trying to resolve what you feel is sort of a contradiction? Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, I think that is helpful, I mean maybe could you be more specific on some of the things that you think get better post-2017. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, it doesn't take much to get better. Taking a couple of hundred million dollars in hits between government actions and big payer hits. We've never had that happen in, I think, 17 years and so, just by not being another 2017, it already is a very nice step-up. In addition, the fact is when we do eliminate some higher than usual rates that is another element of downside that's gone. In addition, we do have some policy upsides. In addition, we're hoping that DMG and international start to be incremental contributors. So, I think those are some of the reasons beyond just the continued positive operating performance of our core U.S. Kidney Care platform, leads us to think we've got a very good chance of doing better. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. That's perfect. Thank you very much. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Hey Gary, while I've got you on the phone, both Jim and I have answers. This is Javier. I don't think I was clear in my answer. I might have even misspoken. The Medicaid is likely not to come back and the non-Medicaid is too early to tell. I think I might have confused my labels there. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: And Gary on the share count question, it's 194,554,000, and that's also disclosed on the face of the balance sheet. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks very much. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Gary. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor [JPMorgan Securities]. Your line is open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. Couple of questions, one, since you mentioned it, is there a date for the Capital Markets Day yet for 2017? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: We're targeting a time in late May, Gary, and we're just finishing up that. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Another question around the Amgen contract, is the contract structured in such a way that the CMS ASP calculations are going to reflect your substantial savings? And if so, what's the risk that they look at rebasing the bundle again? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: Gary, the way our contract's structured has little to do with how CMS sees the data and the spend. And so you remember that CMS has to look at all of the inputs of cost to the facility and should do a rebasing, what you're referring to on a holistic basis. So, they'll be looking at lots of things, including how much we're spending on Epogen and how much the industry is spending on total cost of care. Then number two, I'm sorry, can you remind me the second part of the question? Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I think you kind of handled both, it was just, are they going to be able to see the savings? And if so, risk of potentially rebasing. So I think you hit both. My last question would be, with the $100 million of headwind for 2018, which is about a 6% OI headwind, I know you're not giving 2018 guidance yet, but the Street's got 6% OI growth in 2018, which means, net of that headwind about 12% OI growth. Are there some obvious tailwinds at this point comparable to that $100 million headwind to identify? James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.: I don't think we want to go any further in talking about time beyond 2017, right now. Capital Markets, hopefully, will give you some more insight and analysis to help you think about it, but I don't think we want to go any further now. We have a shot at 2018 being a good year when you think about it in the context of the $100 million headwind created by the accounting change, but nothing that can be put in the bank yet. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Whit Mayo [Robert W. Baird]. Your line is open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. I'm just curious of the conversation around premium support on exchange lives is having any impact on the non-exchange business or maybe said in another way, do we believe that there is any spillover effect in your commercial book from the focus of premium support on the exchanges? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: There hasn't been any that I know of. The other parts of the business are very different from a regulatory and decision-making point of view. So, that's the current status. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And maybe can you elaborate a little bit more on what some of the benefit design changes you're seeing health plans implement that's impeding the ability of the ESRD patients to enroll at this point? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: The real answer is that with open enrollment done, the substantial part of the equation played out. And so, it's not right now about the design issues, but rather that we missed the open window. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And maybe one last one here just looking in my notes, and I can't remember if Renal Ventures is closed or not, I know you re-priced the deal, just any color on the timing and any other relevant developments would be helpful. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Unfortunately, there are no major developments to report on this. It's been a long transaction and we are anticipating in Q2 close, and that's all unfortunately we have to say. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And the original plan was first quarter? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: To be honest with you, the date has been a moving target, I can't remember the last one we gave you, because the buyer and the FTC and the process has been one that's kept going. And so, we've probably given you more dates, and the last one was, I believe, Q1, but I can't recall. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'm going to sneak one more, and just you flagged higher labor cost trends and I presume a lot of this is field level, but any other color you can share around what headwinds you're seeing and maybe comment on merit pay increases? Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I don't have anything insightful. The labor markets are getting tight, it's a competitive landscape, and just workers are demanding higher wages, of course, it's our job to create a special place to work where people are more fulfilled. And so, therefore, on average, wages becomes, while of course, they are beginning to make a competitive wage, but people are less willing to consider moving to another place just for the wages. And so, that's what we're dealing with. I don't have anything else to add to that. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: No. That's helpful. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor [William Blair]. Your line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. First question is a broader one for me. Is there any legislation that you guys have seen that's percolating that might benefit you with the new administration and Congress, and if there was some kind of a tax reform I guess, what could you do with the additional earnings in cash flow? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, if they achieved corporate tax reform, the kind of tax reform that they are talking about, we'll have a really nice party with you guys, because we're one of the highest taxpayers in America, and always have been. And the good news is that the new Congress is really serious about doing that. We're in D.C. now and that subject has probably come up in four of the meetings that I've been in, in the last 24 hours. Having said that, that's a tall mountain to climb and so you've got tremendous resolve with Paul Ryan and others. And at the same time, you've got formidable challenges in pulling it off. So, we just love the fact that it's a real possibility. And then, what will we do with it? Well, I think we'll wait until we're about to get it before we spend too much time on that. But I think we'll put it through the same decision-making filters that we put our current cash flow through. And then I think your broader question about, is there any other legislation? The other piece of legislation which has a good shot is our patient demonstration legislation, wherein we would pick up the right to put thousands and thousands and thousands of our patients into a globally capitated environment, where we can provide integrated care, which would significantly improve clinical outcomes and over time save taxpayers money. So that's a very, very big deal with a number of the bill sponsors here in the last 24 hours who remain very enthused and so that's percolating and has very attractive potential. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just given the changes in profitability. As we look out for you guys, this year what should we expect in terms of the number of centers that you're developing or acquiring in the Kidney Care business. And more broadly, I guess, again, is just smaller competitors that you have, the mom-and-pop shops to smaller regionals. How do they handle the difficult profitability environment and could that impact your business in some way? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Margaret on the de novo certification, we see somewhere in the range of 90 to 110 for 2017. So pretty consistent to the range we had for, did I say 2016. So for 2017, we have that range. It's consistent to the range we had for 2016. As it relates to the small players, we have seen a slight pickup in the marketplace, but the reality is that there is just not a lot out there and so it's on a very low base. And so, you shouldn't see a big spike or meaningful movement in the acquisition number. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, you're not saying then necessarily shutting their doors or anything and the like yet at least? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: We haven't heard any, that doesn't mean that conversations aren't happening. But we have not heard of any. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just one more from me, in terms of Renal Ventures, is that included in guidance and roughly what's the impact? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: It is included in the guidance, and the number, I'll check in a sec here. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: It's not material, is what I'm being told, but I'll get the number in a sec. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Margaret. Margaret, just to wrap up, it's in the, approximately $10 million. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Oh! Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : There are no questions in queue as of this moment. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for your continued interest in our enterprise. We'll do our best to serve your capital well between now and our next call. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC Operator : Welcome, everyone, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of this conference. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim Gustafson. Jim, you may begin. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Ann, and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our new CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer (sic) [Chief Value Officer] (00:54) of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no delay to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Jim, and welcome everyone to this quarterly call. On a summary basis, at the enterprise level, it was a solid performance in a pretty dynamic environment, as you all well know. And at this point, we are on plan to deliver within our guidance, all the normal risks associated therewith. Before we get into any more specifics of our Q1 performance, we will start, as we always do, with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. First, within the DaVita Medical Group, we have a program called Ride the Wave where we attempt to reach out to each and every one of our senior members, that's 360,000 human beings and we hit our goal of just over 95% of these seniors seen at least once during the past year in 2016. This is radically different from the level of care that Medicare patients and Fee-For-Service ever get, and radically different than many other MA plans as well. On to Kidney Care with an equally significant factoid, one-third of our commercial contracts now contain a value-based component. And under these contracts, we typically have catheter targets. And within those targets, we had a 15% improvement in the catheter rate through our improved clinical processes in coordination with payers, et cetera. As many of you know, patients with catheters are nine times more likely to contract a bloodstream infection, and that leads to serious hospitalizations and a lot of other bad stuff. As always, we hasten to emphasize that our quality care, a differentially high quality care not only results in healthier patients, but also drives down healthcare costs. Now, I'll turn it over to Javier for Kidney Care. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Q1 was in line with what we expected in Kidney Care. I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. Our adjusted operating income was $380 million for the quarter. The decrease versus fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by both normal seasonal factors and other factors that we outlined as part of our 2017 guidance. Let me elaborate on each. First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher EPO utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and two fewer treatment days. Second, we faced some swing factors that we've previously disclosed. Let me repeat them and provide some additional color. We'll start with the four headwinds. Number one, we experienced lower enrollment on patients on the ACA plans. Number two, we continue to see an increase of clinical teammate wages. Number three, there was a decline in adjusted operating income in our pharmacy operations. You won't be able to see this in our segment breakout for the first quarter because improvements in other ancillary businesses helped offset this decrease, but you will see the decrease in future quarters. Finally, revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2017, as our forecasted commercial rate decreases take place later in the year. Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds. As discussed previously, we have temporarily decreased our compensation accruals in 2017 due to a switch from profit share programs to a 401(k) match program, and we benefited from lower EPO pricing from our recent renegotiated contract with Amgen. The primary adjustment to our Kidney Care adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was a government settlement that we previously disclosed. As a reminder, we received $538 million in March. Next, we're happy to announce the closing of the acquisition of Renal Ventures effective May 1. We acquired 38 centers in six states. As part of the deal, we had to divest seven centers. The partial year financial impact of this acquisition is already incorporated into our 2017 guidance. Keep in mind that we'll incur some one-time costs to integrate the business. Finally, we just executed an extension to our partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to approximately 7,500 Humana members with late-stage CKD and ESRD. The ESRD industry continues to move in the direction of integrated care due to the number of comorbid conditions that ESRD patients have. Our strong clinical performance improves the quality of life for patients and puts us in a good position to partner with payers to reduce costs to the healthcare system. As to outlook, we're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. As Kent mentioned on our last earnings call, we're in a period of greater uncertainty than is usual for our Kidney Care business given the efforts around repeal and replace and the impact those efforts will have on healthcare in our country and on our business. We will continue to monitor political landscape and represent dialysis patients in those discussions. Now, on to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG. Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Javier. For the first quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an operating income of $12 million. These results include a few things : first, $10 million of expected rate headwind; second, nearly $7 million of previously described accelerated non-cash brand amortization for the transition from HCP to DMG; and third, $50 million of depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter. Finally, reflected in our performance were some higher-than-expected medical expenses in the quarter, driven in part by a more intense flu season in both California and Florida. These expenses were partially offset by composite results from true-ups to existing shared savings pools. As we look at the full year, it is too early to make any changes to the operating income guidance range of $110 million to $150 million, though it is more likely than not to be in the lower half of the range. We'll have more to say about this during the second quarter earnings call after we have visibility from the prior year and the mid-year revenue true-ups that typically occur during summer. Looking beyond 2017, in April, CMS issued the final Medicare Advantage rate notice for the 2018 payment year. Our analysis results in projected rates to be flat from 2017 to 2018. As you may recall, during our Capital Markets Day last year, we communicated an expectation that Medicare rates would track with medical expenses trend over the long term. As a result, we expected approximately 1.5% improvement or $30 million in rate increases for 2018, which we no longer expect to materialize, though we will do our best to mitigate some of it. We will go into further detail regarding our longer-term expectations at our Capital Markets Day later this month. Now, to Joel to discuss international and some other financial items. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Vijay. To everyone on the phone, as you probably know, this is my first earnings call, and it is a pleasure to be here. I look forward to meeting many of you at Capital Markets Day in a few weeks. First, I will address our international operations. The adjusted operating loss from our international business was $11 million. This result includes a $3.5 million currency loss within the Asia Pacific joint venture. A $6 million non-cash gain on the creation of our Asia JV has been excluded from the adjusted operating income. We continue to expect adjusted international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017, excluding any currency gains or losses. We are also excited to welcome Robert Lang as the President of our International Operations. He started with us in April. Robert joins us with extensive experience growing international healthcare and insurance businesses. Next, a few financial details for the enterprise. In the quarter, we generated strong operating cash flow of $865 million, positively impacted by the settlement payment received from the government. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita, Inc. was 40% in the quarter, after non-GAAP adjustments highlighted in the press release. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita, Inc. in 2017 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. We, like other U.S.-centric healthcare service providers, pay among the highest tax rates in corporate America. Finally, our debt expense for the quarter was $104 million. Now over to Kent for a few closing comments. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I'll get to Q&A in one second, but just a couple of thoughts. With respect to DaVita Kidney Care, three points : number one, we are undoubtedly going through a period of regulatory turbulence; number two, the foundation, however, for this business is distinctively strong; and number three, we continue to be excited about the prospect of integrated care upside. On to the DaVita Medical Group : number one, certainly short-term operating income disappointment; but number two, we enjoy formidable market positions; and number three, have maintained a very healthy cash flow. And then lastly, with respect to international : number one, this is a controlled adventure; and number two, the long-term growth upside is really quite striking. Operator, can we move on to Q&A, please? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck. Kevin, your line is now open. Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. This is Catherine Anderson on for Kevin. You highlighted a $100 million headwind to guidance from commercial pricing. The last quarter, you indicated that you think it wouldn't continue into 2018. Can you talk a little bit about your managed care contracting over the past few months and how confident you are that it's a one-time reset? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Catherine, let me see if I get the \u2013 what you're going for in your question. The short answer is you have not seen the hit because they're in the back end of the year. And how we're feeling about the environment is that the environment is very active on the one topic of charitable premium assistance, but the relationship with our payers continue to be what they have been for years. And as you see from the announcement on Humana, we continue to negotiate all of our contracts. And actually, we are in a situation where right now we are as contracted as we've been for quite some time. I don't believe we said $100 million in headwind is incorporated in our guidance. So, we'll have to check that. Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then in your guidance, were you assuming that all of the Medicaid-eligible patients who moved out of exchange funds, they were going into Medicaid this year? Has that been working out? And how much of your commercial revenue is getting support from the AKF today? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. On the first part of your question, yes, those patients have gone back to Medicaid. And as to the second part of your question, I'm not going to provide any additional details than what we've already provided. Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: This is Jim Gustafson. I just want to confirm, we have not given a number to the commercial rate headwind. It's incorporated in our guidance, but we didn't say $100 million. Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Catherine. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary. Gary, your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi Jim, (14:48) it's me. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Hi, Gary. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. So I guess, maybe just to follow-up on the last question, Javier, regarding the commercial pricing. Is the expectation still that the pressure is going to be on the small number of, I guess, out of network rates that you expect to see decreases on? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Gary. As you know, there's a wide distribution of rate. And what we want to do is make sure that we do what's right for the long term. So sometimes, we have some of their outliers that we need to bring in, and we do have a small set of out-of-network rates, and so those are sometimes the one we're discussing here. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe you mentioned EPO, I guess, utilization being up a little bit in response to flu. Can you discuss, to whatever extent that you're willing, kind of impact it had in the quarter? Or is the new contract in place? And, I guess, are you seeing the benefit from it as you would have expected? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. We are seeing the benefit as we expected. And of course, we had to go down, wind down some inventory that we had, but we are experiencing the contract as we anticipated. As it relates to the spike on the seasonal, of course, it's very hard to predict and isolate because of the flu season, it's sort of a moving target, if you will. And with the prescriptions the way they are, meaning every physician gets to make their own, it's almost impossible to diagnose a number. But if you had to put it in a range or you had to bracket it, I'd put it anywhere from $5 million to $15 million or so. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then is there any way to give us any color on how the inventory issue, I guess, will benefit you to a greater extent in future quarters? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: On that, it's just basically we're winding down from inventory that was purchased at the previous contract. So, it's probably not worth worrying about. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa. Lisa, your line is now open. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. I just wanted to get some clarification on the current guidance with regards to the premium support issues. So the 2,000 patients who are Medicaid-eligible, as the question earlier alluded to, so it's my understanding those have disappeared, so that's a $140 million headwind. But then you also gave guidance for another $90 million headwind from the non-Medicaid patients on the exchanges who have premium support and then also the non-Medicaid patients off the exchanges who have premium support. I'm just wondering particularly in between those two buckets, have you seen further erosion of the exchange-based book in addition to those 2,000 Medicaid-eligible? And then also separately, has there been any impact on the off-exchange individual plans? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. So, I'll try to give you as much as I know and then let me know if that answers the question. We did see those 2,000 patients that you alluded to, which is $140 million. It's probably not worth going to the detail on the $90 million, but at the end of the day, we did some handicapping as to what would happen, and the number worked out to be in the right range. And so as opposed to the journey, the destination ended up being the right one. How many patients are on and off exchange? We're kind of combining them, and there's approximately 2,500, which is, of course, give or take, half of the 3,000 plus 2,000 that we alluded to last year. Does that answer your question? Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. I'm a bit confused, because I thought there are 2,500 on exchange, 2,000 of whom are Medicaid eligible. So that leaves you with 500 who are on exchange. And you would know by now whether they've re-enrolled or not. And then there was about 1,000 who are off exchange in individual plans with premium support. At least that was my understanding of what the numbers looked like. So clearly, bucket number one, the Medicaid eligible goes away but then the others, if it's still a $90 million headwind, does that also include the impact from any rate pressure on your sort of broader private book of business? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I think the confusion might be \u2013 we did not, to my recollection, provide detail on, on and off exchange. We basically just said that there was 5,000 patients on the exchanges. And so maybe that's where the confusion is coming from. And so we have not disclosed any additional detail. And so what I am telling you is that we have 2,500 patients that are both the addition of on and off exchange. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin. Justin, your line is now open. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Hi, Justin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. A bunch of questions here. So I'll just ask a few and jump back into the queue. So first, just to follow up on a couple of numbers. The commercial contracting pressure, Javier, can you repeat what you said there? I apologize. I thought I caught it. But did you say that most of that hasn't actually developed yet, and that it's more of a back half of the year issue? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I did. And we did not provide additional detail on the numbers. We were just clarifying a number that was thrown out. That wasn't a number that we had cited in the past. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So, you haven't actually agreed to any rate cuts on these out of network? It's just something that you anticipate could happen given what's going on in the world? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: There are some that are handicapped, which we always do for you. We try to give the best stab in anticipating what's going to transpire during the year. And then there are some that have been agreed to and have an effective date that hasn't been incorporated in Q1. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. So effectively, the stuff that's been agreed to at least, that's going to be in the back half of the year, would be an incremental headwind to 2018 as they are annualized (21:43)? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Correct, it will be in our run rate. Correct. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then remind me the patients that you had, the 5,000 patients on exchanges. Can you tell me the number of patients that were in Medicaid? Was that number 2,000? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then the patients that made up the $90 million that you expected also to lose. Can you give me that number out of the 5,000? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Let me see. I don't think I could give you any additional detail on that, Justin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I figured I'd take a shot. So then, while we're on commercial, can you update your commercial mix now? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: What have we disclosed? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: We're still at 11%, Justin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : You're still at 11% even after losing 2,500 patients that had commercial individual insurance? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: So at the end of the fourth quarter, we were rounding down to 11%, now we're rounding up. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, so it's down about 100 basis points. And if you were to exclude what happened in the individual market, can you give me the underlying trends? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: The trends on what, Justin? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : I'm sorry, if you were to exclude this one-time change in the individual market, right, if we were to call it that. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. What we... Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : If you pull those numbers out, did commercial mix improve or moderate, Q4 to Q1? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, we're seeing it moderate, I guess, to use your word, flat. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, last question before I jump back in. Just the international segment, international and other, I should say, together lost $25 million. Can you give us an idea of what you expect that \u2013 I mean I know you told us $20 million on international, can you give us a number or ballpark in the other segment for the year? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Give us one second, Justin, or maybe let's move on and we'll come back to it. That's not a number we typically are prepped on. I mean, of course, it's incorporated within our guidance and we try to do the additional service of carving out international here for the last several quarters, but the other number you're asking for is not something we've classically calculated and forecasted, so let us reflect a little bit. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Is that mostly Part D? And is that like a reasonable run rate to think about at least, this quarter is at a reasonable run rate then? You can't give us the guidance for the year? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think we want to throw out a spontaneous answer because again, you're asking for a parsing we've never done. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: So, give us a little time to stare at it. It's not an unreasonable question. It's just not something we've ever parsed that way before. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thanks guys. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret. Margaret, your line is now open. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. This is actually Scott Schaper on for Margaret. I wanted to ask just briefly, anything going on in the rumored new push for healthcare reform and do you see that could help or hurt DaVita and its patients? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, there's just so much speculation, Scott. I think we could talk about what's been talked about yesterday, but it will probably be different tomorrow. And so I think it's not good to speculate. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And you closed a deal this morning in the DMG group. Maybe just talk about the changes the team has made over the last two years or so in identifying quality assets that can contribute to that group. And maybe if you could, you could touch on a number of quality assets that you currently view as compelling in the way you see that going? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Scott, could you just repeat the question so I don't ramble around? Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. It's just basically, what have you guys done from a management team perspective that you can point to towards identifying quality assets that can contribute almost immediately or in the near term in the DMG group versus historical where it's taken sometime or have not been great purchases at least at the start? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. Well, I guess, I'd give a two-part answer, and then you can come back for more. Number one, we said, think about a year ago that because we were still digesting some of the acquisitions we had made in the prior year-and-a-half that we were going to have a tighter filter on doing any new market large deals. And since that time, we haven't done any. There's always a chance that over the next year, we will do one, but there's also a very good chance we won't do any because we've got a bunch of opportunities in our existing markets and we want to focus on those. The second dimension of looking for quality assets is in our existing markets. And here, we are looking at a nice steady space of what we call tuck-in deals where we're buying or merging in small practices or medium-sized practices and attaching them to some of our existing assets. And that process is moving along quite nicely. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. So that's how we should think about it, kind of smaller tuck-ins versus anything that's done on larger scale, at least for the near term? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: The odds are that that's the case. Again, every now and then, the quality new asset and a new market that's big pops up. In general, we're not price competitive on those. But you never know, maybe one day, we'll get one. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just quickly for \u2013 probably for Javier. Last quarter, you guys said I think it was $10 million included in OI for Renal Ventures. Is that still how you guys are thinking about that for the remainder of the year? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: It's in the range but as we disclosed, it's not a very significant number for the year. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa. Lisa, your line is now open. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. Thanks for giving me the follow-up question. I was just going back to my numbers, and one thing that you did disclose in your October 31 press release was that out of that 5,000, you had 2,000 Medicaid eligible. But then of the remaining 3,000, about 1,500 were on some sort of premium support. So I suppose my question is, given that the regulations are on premium support haven't actually changed, are you seeing losses from those patients because insurance companies are successfully denying acceptance of premium support? And is there any difference in their sort of ability to do that whether it's an on-exchange or off-exchange individual plan? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. It's really hard to parse through what's going on. And so why patients are doing what they're doing with plans, exiting and other things around it. So instead of giving you a specific answer, let me just give you the total. We're at 3,000, and we're at 2,500. And so we can't parse through with clarity as to why the number changed, but that's probably better just to give you where it ends \u2013 well, where it is as opposed to where it ends. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. That's fair enough. And then I suppose just on the disclosure generally, because it's ultimately just up to the patient whether they're getting the premium support and buying the private insurance or not, so you don't really have much visibility on the ins and outs of it. Is that fair? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: It's fair. Yes. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Great. Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin. Justin, your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. So a few more here. I'll just follow up here to see if I could try this one more time, this individual stuff. Just going through the numbers, it does seem interesting. So the 2,000 Medicaid lives that you said were on individual plans are now \u2013 are back on Medicaid, right? And that costs $140 million. Is that the correct way to think about those? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Let's just be clear about one thing. It's important. They never left Medicaid. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : No, I apologize. You're right. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: So they lost supplemental coverage, which in most cases, was a beautiful thing for improved coverage and care. And they lost that in the midst of all the controversy, but they were never off of Medicaid. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll move on from the subject. If we could just talk a little bit about DMG, you talked about there was \u2013 you had expected a $30 million improvement in rates for 2018, and now it looks like you're not going to get those. Given the rates looked pretty benign at least on the high-end, I know there is rate changes at the accounting level as well from rebasing. Can you just tell us what changed in your mind that took that $30 million to zero? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Justin, I think the basic premise is that we expected over time that the rate setting process with CMS would more or less have the rates track with the market medical expense trend in the markets that we operate in. And we didn't know if we would have them one year, two years or what the longer timeframe would be, but we expected it to track more or less. And the bottom line is that we now know the 2018 rates will not do that because they're going to be relatively flat. And it's about 0.5% difference versus what CMS expected overall, and that is the geographic differential. But ultimately, the $30 million is a headwind because we do expect the medical expense trend next year, and it won't be covered through rates. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. So when you think about that, does it put a risk on your ability to hit that $250 million target that you put out there for 2019 for DMG? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. No doubt, the $30 million is a headwind, and we're going to work with our payers and our providers to do our best to mitigate as much of that as possible. But on the other hand, I do think that we are more confident about our ability to increase the savings and efficiencies in administration between now and then. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: But Justin, Kent Thiry here. It was an assumption we had that turned out to be incorrect. And so it's definitely a reduction. And now the challenge becomes how many other places can we find anything incremental for a partial offset. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. And then you mentioned this Humana contract on Integrated Care, certainly sounds interesting. Can you give us any more color in terms of how this is set up? For instance, this is a full capitation, or is it risk sharing on these numbers? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. It is a mix of both of those. So we have some set fees, and we have some things that relate against value based, in particular, in CKD. And so there's a whole bunch of things that are trying to reward good transitions into ESRD and savings around the transition around that. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And so you had talked about obviously the opportunity for Medicaid to actually make a profit in Medicare by offering these capabilities to managed care. And I think you had even talked about there's a number that's been thought of in terms of the potential upside versus just providing a Medicare treatment. Is it fair to think of the economics here as similar to that upside that you typically have in Medicare Advantage in terms of what you get paid for in treatment? Or is it better or worse than that? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Well, Justin, I'll go first on this one. It varies all over the map and not only by a private payer does it vary by contract, but also even within Medicare and Medicare Advantage, it differs geographically and it differs by what the baselines are that you start with. So it's a wide distribution curve. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. I can see that must be tough to nail down. Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks for all the questions, guys. Appreciate it. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary. Gary, your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Maybe just \u2013 on a similar topic. At the end of last year, the industry, it sounded like felt pretty good about moving some legislation or trying to get some legislation moved through Congress that would make it easier to move towards an accountable care model. Any comments on what you think the chances are for something to get attached in the current Congress? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I'd make two points. First, a generic one, that in a world where Congress is passing very little of anything, it makes it very difficult to find a vehicle to attach to because there's lots of people with lots of attachments and very few vehicles, and so that's an environmental problem that exists for us and others. Second, as to the particulars of our Patient Act that we have a real shot. You never know how this works, you would never say the odds are on your side, because in a world where little is being passed, you just can never say that. But it's a highly respected piece of legislation with broad bipartisan support. I'll remind everyone that we passed the House Ways & Means Committee late last fall with one dissenting vote in a year when that virtually never happened in any piece of substantive legislation in the House. Having said that, it's a real battle each new year to try to rise above the noise. And so, I think, I just have to leave it as we have a real shot, and we're working hard and it would be a tremendous victory for both patients and the taxpayers and that's increasingly known and increasingly attractive, but that doesn't mean it's in the home stretch. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: You're welcome, Gary. Operator : We show no further questions on queue at this time. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: All right. Thank you all for your continued interest in DaVita, and we will do our best for you between now and Capital Markets in a few weeks. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Analysts: Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC Operator : Good evening. My name is Kristine, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kristine, and welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning those risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and thank all of you for your interest in DaVita. We will today, of course, discuss what we would characterize as a solid quarter. Before we get into the specifics of that quarter however, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are first and foremost a care giving entity. Within DaVita Medical Group, we achieved 4.9 star average ratings across all markets. If you round in the same way that CMS rounds, would equal a 5 star, which is the highest we've ever achieved and is literally outstanding. It means we're doing wonderful things clinically with our physicians for our patients and also makes us differentially attractive to our payer partners. Within DaVita Kidney Care, fluid overload is one of the three leading causes of hospitalizations. Our own clinical researchers estimate that patients who do not achieve the recommended post-treatment weight have a 50% high risk of mortality over the subsequent year further underlying the significance of this clinical event. We have special initiatives aimed at ensuring our patients achieve target fluid levels. And in the second quarter of 2017, we had our best ever percentage of patients achieving that recommended post-treatment weight with a 10% year-over-year improvement. That's a big deal. And I'll now turn it over to Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care to discuss that quarter. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon, everyone. Kidney Care adjusted operating income for the quarter was $402 million, up $22 million or 6% versus the first quarter. Overall, results were in line with our expectations. Let me cover some highlights. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.6%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. As a reminder, we expect to see fluctuations around this range on a quarterly basis. Revenue per treatment was down by $3.38 quarter-over-quarter. As we disclosed at Capital Markets Day, Q1 revenue benefited from some positive one-time adjustments. We continue to expect full-year average revenue per treatment in 2017 to be down 1% to 2% from full-year average in 2016. Our patient care cost per treatment was down $5.65 quarter-over-quarter driven by better performance in center operating expenses and normal seasonal factors that negatively impact quarter one cost per treatment, including EPO utilization, payroll taxes, and less treatment days. Now, turning on to our outlook. We're raising the bottom end of 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance by $40 million. Our new guidance range is now $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. Looking ahead to 2018, similar to the last couple of years, we will issue formal guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. That said, I want to remind you of a couple of specific items to keep in mind as you look at 2018. Number one, we will have a year-over-year headwind of approximately $100 million due to our recent change from profit share program to a 401(k) match program. Number two, our cost inflation continues to outpace the rate increases we received from payers. It may be hard to see this trend in second quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the benefit from our new EPO contract as well as a one-time benefit from the transition to 401(k). Lastly, as a reminder, the proposed 2018 Medicare rate increase in the preliminary rule is 0.7%. Now, I hand it over to Joel to discuss DMG. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Javier. For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionally high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating income of $34 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter. Now, with respect to our value conversion. We're on track to our plan since our last update. We've signed a contract in Colorado, one of our newer geographies, and expect to add value contracts in New Mexico and Washington State by the end of the year. We had a fairly active quarter in closing tuck-in acquisitions of new groups in our existing geographies. We believe that these transactions are a capital-efficient and low risk way of acquiring new physicians and patients. Collectively, the groups we acquired in recent months consist of approximately 140 providers serving nearly 200,000 patients, of which about 20,000 are currently capitated. Regarding guidance for DMG, we're leaving our 2017 adjusted operating income guidance unchanged at $110 million to $150 million and we still believe it's more likely that we will be in the bottom half of this range. This operating income range includes an estimated $240 million in depreciation and amortization for 2017. Now, to International. International operating losses in the quarter were $13 million, which includes approximately $4 million of prior period adjustments and a $1 million foreign exchange loss. For the full year in the International business, we now expect adjusted operating income loss in the low $30 millions plus or minus a bp. This excludes the impact of currency and one-time expenses. We're disappointed in this change in guidance, which is the result of lower than anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics. These changes in outlook is incorporated in our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care and the enterprise. Looking forward, we expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. Whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017 and early 2018. Finally, some comments on cash flow and capital deployment. Second quarter operating cash flow up of $146 million was adversely impacted by the timing of cash tax payments associated with our settlement with the VA that was announced in the first quarter and by an increase in accounts receivable DSO. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $1 billion and our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. As we discussed at our Capital Markets Day, we expect to be using some of this strong consistent cash flow as part of our long-term strategy to repurchase stock over the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 3.6 million shares or more than 1.8% of our shares outstanding for $232 million. Now, over to Kent for a few closing comments. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I don't really have anything new to say. I would just step back and make a few observations. Number one, it was a solid quarter. Number two, we have a solid foundation. Number three, we have some wonderfully valuable assets. And number four, we are good at what people want more of. With that, let's get on to Q&A please, operator. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. Just wondering if you can provide a little more color on commercial in the quarter on the dialysis side. How has the switch around third-party premium support on the exchanges gone versus your guidance? And then any kind of new pushback from payers on rates on the non-individual business? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin, this is Javier. Nothing has changed from when we talked last quarter and so our relationships with payers continue to be the same. We're trying to make sure we add the right value to their members and our patients and nothing has changed in the guidance as it relates to the economics we gave you last quarter. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. So I guess when you provided guidance at the Analyst Day, you mentioned $45 million to $90 million of kind of additional risk that wasn't reflected in the actual results this year. Can you provide a little bit of color as to how we should think about that for 2018? Is that risk that you think we should be building in as far as pressure into 2018 or is that something that at this point you don't feel like you're going to experience, but you just want to highlight for conservatism's sake? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Well, let me clarify, Kevin. I think what we said is, people wanted to frame what was the risk in the individual plans if CPA was completely eliminated. So we said on the outer bounds that's the $90 million. We said, if CPA was eliminated in an individual plan, that some people would have some tax credits and other things, so that's why we put a range of $45 million to $90 million. Does that answer your question? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, I guess, my understanding was that when you initially talked about $140 million to $230 million as the issue here you have said that $230 million was the right number to think about, but there was still $40 million to $90 million of potential pressure, that some things came in better, some things came in worse and that there was still $45 million to $90 million of \"risk\" in the commercial numbers. Is that not correct? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I think the way I would frame it is that we've had \u2013 we've learned more as the quarters have come along and then we've superseded information and updated it. And so, now we're saying, hey, the easiest way to do instead of getting to all the different slices is number one, the risk that's left in individual plans on CPA is at $45 million to $90 million, it then went away. And then number two, our average revenue will be down 1% to 2% over our average revenue in 2016. That that is sort of the freshest information that we have and the most useful information that we have. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Then just last question, that $45 million to $90 million, how do we think about that, is there a reason to think that didn't present this year, the reason to think it will present next year, what would be the indication or cause of that following through next year, if it didn't follow through this year absent regulatory guidance? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I think we don't have any visibility on timing per se, but we were trying to be useful when people were trying to frame and size the risk of CPA in an individual plan. So we put the number out there without any sense of whether it would occur or not or any sense of timing on it but rather just trying to frame and size the number. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And what I might add Kevin is, is we would not try to characterize any change in the risk. No increase, no decrease nor any change in our ability to predict when the government might come up with something that would constitute a decision that there is a bunch of no change. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good evening. Few questions here. First, maybe you could just tell us what kind of payer mix changes or commercial mix changes I should say, you saw in Q2, if any? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Nothing that's worth calling out, Justin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So, pretty steady Q1 to Q2. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then Kent, I know you don't want to give specific 2018 earnings guidance in the second quarter, but earlier this year you talked about targeting growth in overall operating income next year. Just curious, given all the moving parts, any updated thoughts on that target? Can you grow OI in 2018? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: My memory of what we said in the Capital Markets, Justin, and Jim to my left here will clarify if I get it wrong is that our comments at Capital Markets, of course, is usually do supersede any prior comments and we didn't make any representations on 2018 relative to 2017 at that time, but let me turn to Mr. Gustafson. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: That is correct. So, it's just too soon, Justin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. I mean, I get this question a reasonable amount. So maybe, is there any color you can give us on why you felt comfortable earlier in the year talking to that, but less comfortable now? Is there any changes that you want to point us to? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I think I just became more thoughtful. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. Last question, there are a number of commercial plans like Aetna, Humana and Anthem exiting the exchanges for next year or at least some of their exchange footprint for next year. And so the payer mix could start to change in \u2013 just in terms of the plans that are still offering and where these numbers shake out. Any thoughts on how we should think about the potential of that impacting 2018? Or as you look at it, are better payers leaving, and maybe lower payers staying or is it vice versa, any insight there? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. As opposed to quantifying whether they're better or worse, I think the answer arithmetically is that is minimal change to our economics. Of course, there are some payers that are still deciding but the majority of what we've seen now is minimal impact economically because most members have a comparable option in their market. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from Tejus Ujjani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Tejus. Thanks for taking the question. Can you share some color on the situation with Aetna? From public court docs, it looks like there is an ongoing feud in which they're requesting member records related to CPA, and if I'm correct, DVA is basically refusing to provide the records. Any color you can share on that status and as well as the administrative subpoena from the DoJ on AKF related patients? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. That request that Aetna had was denied and we're working with Aetna to get a download under what's in, to make sure that we adhere to the contract and that we get them the proper documents Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And any, can you share your latest thoughts on some of the legislative efforts out in California? I think people are familiar with SB 349 regarding the minimum staffing requirements. But there's another item called AB 251, that I think is still in progress out there. I mean it's essentially attempting to mandate medical loss ratios or cap dialysis clinics to like 15% and I think DVA has quite a bit of exposure out in California. Just trying to think about how you're, understand that situation and how you think about the risk. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Both of these bills are being driven by a union, and what we're saying is, this is an unprecedented act, this AB 251. And of course, it is not good for patients. It is not good for the citizen because there are some centers that are profitable and they carry all the centers that are not profitable. And so, if that passes, it would have a disruption to the care and over the long haul, it would be a real problem for the ERs and for the patients there. So we hope that policy makers will see through this as what it is, which is bad policy, and we of course are working hard with all our constituents in the community to educate them. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Looking at the cost per treatment in the quarter, if I isolate all of the EPO purchases just within the June quarter, was it all under the new contract or did you have any purchases or any old inventory that you were working through rather I should say? And I'm just trying to think through the run rate going forward. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. All of the purchases were under the new contract for this quarter. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, does the second quarter have the full benefit of the new contract or is there a tail on this that we should consider as the year plays out? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: It's got the benefit that's intended to have for this year. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, got it. And maybe just any details on DaVita Health Solutions. I think you announced a new segment during the quarter. Just kind of curious more on what the model is and can it be built out, the infrastructure. Do you need to acquire any capabilities such as home health and SNF, just any color on exactly what this business is? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. I'm happy to answer, although we don't want to put too much of a spotlight on it because it's just a startup and so it will take time before it would ever really warrant a significant amount of attention. But to your specific question as to whether or not we need to acquire any capabilities, no, not within the current scope of the business. One of the beauties of what we do at DaVita Health Solutions is capabilities that we've been practicing at the DaVita Medical Group for 10, 15, 20 years in most cases. And so, its stuff that we're very good at, we're very credible at. And so, we look forward to advancing the cause and for those who aren't familiar, the short characterization of what we do is, is we got to a payer and take over responsibility for the top X thousand and some of their most sick, most expensive, most at risk patients and in particular focused on SNF management and house calls. Although, there is other things we do as well including at times, palliative care, et cetera. So that's a little bit of a thumbprint. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And maybe my last question just on DaVita Medical Group. There was a jump in the capitated revenue in the quarter but the capitated lives declined sequentially and year-over-year. So, is there anything notable to call out, anything one-time, any payments we should be aware of? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: There was a change in the accounting. Some of our shared risk contracts converted to global risk. The net result is the institutional component of the cost, which used to be accounted for on a net basis, is now accounted for on a gross basis, which drives the revenue up. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. I guess, I'll follow-up afterwards. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Look, I realize I'm talking my book here, but we ran some analysis on paper, the economics of selling DMG and buying back stock are pretty overwhelmingly positive for shareholders. I know what the bodyline has been, but maybe you could reiterate the bodyline and what it would take to maybe shift your thinking, if at all? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. So, look, we talked extensively at Capital Markets Day about our capital allocation strategy and our focus on OI growth and return on capital. I'm not going to reiterate that, nothing has changed. Regarding the specific analysis, really two major drivers driving most of the value in your report. One is increased leverage, and we could achieve that increased leverage whether we sell DMG or not. The second was the implied increase in EBITDA multiple, which is hard to count on. So, that's our thinking about the analysis regarding DMG, look, we've laid out a plan to drive OI growth of $100 million or so over a couple of years. We feel good about the business. So, that's where we are. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. I just had a question about DMG for 2018. I know you had previously talked about the MA rates constituting about a $30 million headwind. You're taking a goodwill charge of $51 million, which I understand is present value of DMG or certain markets over time. So I guess my primary question here is, is there any change to how you've evaluated the rate headwind for 2018 since the Capital Markets Day? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: No change. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then in that same discussion in the press release that you had mentioned the rate pressure for 2018, but also makes comment about increasing medical costs, and I presume that was kind of talking about 2018 and I presumed it meant rate pressure in the context of a business where medical costs rise and I just wanted to make sure that was \u2013 those presumptions were correct and there wasn't some other comment about something happening in terms of medical costs in the near-term? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: No, I think your characterization is fair. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We show no further questions in queue at this time. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Operator, we'll just give it another 15, 20 seconds just to make sure. Operator : We have a question from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two from me, real quick. In terms of Renal Ventures, can you give us an update in terms of what stage you are at right now in incorporating them into DaVita and how should we look at the next few quarters in terms of cost for that acquisition? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: We are in the initial parts of the integration. We, of course, will have the one-time cost in year one. And then, we will have them in a normalized way by fourth quarter or so going into Q1 of next year's run rate. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then in terms of the joint venture that you guys have in China, it's been a while since we've heard about that. Can you talk a little bit about how much investment has gone into that partnership at this point? What have you learned and maybe what's been surprising at the upside or the downside? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: So, we don't disclose the specific capital that we've allocated internationally. In terms of China specifically, it's a fascinating market. It's growing incredibly rapidly from a patient standpoint. That said, we have learned the challenges of entering China as a multinational corporation. We are looking at our strategy going forward thinking about partnerships as an opportunity for entering the market specifically. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And let me just try to clarify Margaret, were you referring to our Asia-Pacific joint venture with Mitsui and Khazanah or were you referring to a very, very tiny dialysis joint venture we had in one particular geography in China? Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: The former. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. And so, what \u2013 that partnership still exists, and in fact, Khazanah and Mitsui just put in their second tranche of their committed $300 million investment. So, there is another $100 million in the balance sheet as of the last 24 hours or so, and we continue to look forward to working with them to grow that business over the long term. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Are you guys saying revenues and I guess, P&L expenses for that business, and where are you reporting that? Is that the other line? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Right now our international operations are just reported in one set full piece, and for the near term, that's really our intention. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right, thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Margaret. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Just a few more here, since we got the time. I know you got a question on DMG post the goodwill impairments. The commentary in the press release indicated that it's going to be tough to offset that $30 million of rate pressure next year. Should we think about that as, given the fact that you took those impairments, it's less likely you can offset that $30 million and we should think about that as potentially a greater risk than you even mentioned at the Investor Day or is this just kind of mechanical? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: It's more mechanical, Justin. There hasn't been any change in our assessment of the risk upside or downside since Capital Markets. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. And then, it was really helpful to get an updated view on the international business. Anything you could tell us about what you expect to have in terms of ancillary and corporate losses that's built into the guidance for this year? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Could you say the question again, Justin? I'm not sure on exactly what you're going for. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Well, I guess just trying to understand, the international business is generating losses. We also know that you have corporate costs that basically offset dialysis income. And so the corporate costs and the ancillary businesses that are losing money, any thoughts like, can you share with us what you think those losses could be as we're trying to model out 2017? Any projection for corporate losses and ancillary and \u2013 or I should say corporate and ancillary losses for 2017? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: So would you be primarily referring to the strategic initiatives line item or something else? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Correct. No, that's it. That's the ancillary business. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Yeah, Justin, what you're seeing in that number and the reason why it grew is, you're seeing the effects of the management fee from Rx that we talked about in Capital Markets. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: So, you'll see that run rate continue. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So this is a reasonable run rate the second quarter for the rest of the year. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: The other aspect of this question is the SI line. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. On the SIs, you're talking about the $25 million this quarter and that is mainly again, Rx. It's got an addition of some integrated care initiatives, but the bulk of it is Rx. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just a couple of the numbers questions, DSOs were up four days year-over-year and two days sequentially. Anything to note here? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Nothing particular to note other than our run rate is going to be more in the range that it is now. We had some operational changes and we think that this is the right range going forward. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And lastly, in the press release you noted that the company obviously did a significant amount of share repo in the second quarter but hadn't done any post June, so nothing in July. Anything we should read into that? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: No. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, so we should \u2013 at the Investor Day you had talked about share repurchase being a significant use of free cash flow. We should still expect that to continue through the rest of the year, is that reasonable? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Nothing about our plans for capital allocation and share repurchase specifically has changed. We think the $230 million that we bought back during the quarter was a good pace for us. There are a lot of criteria that go into whether we buy at a moment in time that relates to our cash flow, our growth, our leverage levels, the stock price, etcetera, and as a reminder we are blacked out at certain points because of earnings and other issues. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: All right, thanks, Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from Tejus Ujjani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up question. Just want to clarify one of the responses to my question on the Aetna records. When you said it was denied, did you mean DaVita denied the request or the court denied the request? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: The court. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then also just to go back to the Capital Markets Day, and DaVita Rx, you talked about $70 million to $90 million EBITDA headwind. I think some of that was from loss of patient volume associated with co-pay support as well as fortifying some compliance. But you mentioned that that wasn't at all related to the AKF. Can you just clarify who is providing that support if it wasn't the AKF and also kind of how much of headwind was that actually in the quarter? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I do not know the technical answer as to who provides that support. So, we'll have to get back to you on that. And we also added a couple of things as to why the \u2013 it is what it is. We also said that the pharmaceutical pricing had not passed, so that was a pass through in essence when prices go up that had not increased. And then secondly, we talked about a contract that had changed its contribution in addition to the two other items that you brought up. And that run rate, that $70 million to $90 million hit is included in this quarter. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, sorry if you have addressed this. I'm just old and forgetful. But the cadence of the EPO purchasing benefit. I mean, we've taken some statements from the manufacturer to interpret that to mean, it's sort of equally weighted between this year and next year. Is that a fair way to think about it? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I don't know if we can comment on that. We have big restrictions on what we can say on the contract. So I think, we're going to have to pass on that one. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well. I thought I would try anyway. All right. Thank you. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good try. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Operator : We show no further questions in queue at this time. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Well. Thank you all for your interest. We'll work hard for you between now and the next time we talk. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good evening. My name is Jenny, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remark there will be question-and-answer period. Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Jenny, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning those risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings release out earlier today and our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Jim and thanks everyone for joining our call. Before we get into the specifics of our Q3 financial performance and outlook, we'll start as we always do with our clinical performance. First within the DaVita Medical Group, the opioid epidemic, of course, is getting a great amount of publicity and appropriately so. Our Everett Clinic in Washington was recently awarded with the Washington State Medical Association's highest award for patient safety because of their work in this category. We had an amazingly robust program where we implemented pain scarring tools, risk assessment, urine screen and trainings supporting for providers. And were recognized by the community for the exemplary leadership that we demonstrated. Within DaVita Kidney Care, it's a good time to step back and stare at our cumulative accomplishment in the area of integrated care. If you look at the C-SNIPs that we've been involved with for 10 years or so, the outcomes are simply outstanding, just to name a few. 25% reduction in hospitalizations, 49% fewer readmissions, 66% lower CBC rates compared to the national average, et cetera, et cetera. And the recent ESCO data both from us and others further reaffirms the value, the potential, both clinical and economic, of integrated care. It is all relevant not only clinically for our community but for our shareholders as well because it seriously supports and reinforces the arguments for our PATIENTS Act where we'd build on these existing vehicles to really scale those integrated care accomplishment. As many of you probably noted, the bill was reintroduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate in just the last couple of weeks. This proposal is scalable, it's sustainable, does not penalize high-quality providers like DaVita, and it gives nephrologist flexible and substantive participation options, more on that in the quarters to come. But now I'll turn it over to Joel Ackerman to discuss DaVita Medical Group. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items. Before I discuss the drivers of this disappointing outcome, let me start by saying that we recognize that the business is not achieving our capital return expectations nor is it contributing to OI growth. We recognize the skepticism investors will have right now as a result, but we remain confident that the operational changes we are making will result in improved financial performance in the future. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $45 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative and depreciation of $16 million for the quarter. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating loss of $5 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $55 million for the quarter. The outcome this quarter is primarily the result of two drivers. First, higher than expected medical costs, which represents about $30 million of impact. This is largely of the result of two things; increased utilization, driven by higher patient acuity than we have seen in the past; and by true-ups of prior period costs that impact our shared savings result. We anticipate the higher acuity seen during the year will result in increased revenue of approximately $30 million in 2018 as the new diagnoses of these patients will be reflected in our 2018 reimbursement. Second, the finalization of prior year Medicare Advantage payments, which we have historically received in the third quarter, was delayed by CMS. For your reference, this was a $13 million item in 2016. Despite this underperformance, we continue to make operational progress on the four drivers of improvement we laid out at our Capital Markets Day. However, the financial impact of these operational changes have yet to show up in our results. Of particular note, during Q3, we announced the restructuring that eliminated 350 non-clinical positions in DMG. We expect the resulting annualized savings to be approximately $40 million per year starting in 2018. Looking forward, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted operating income for DMG to be in the range of $50 million to $85 million. We plan to give 2018 DMG OI guidance in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. While we're not giving specific 2018 guidance at this time, we expect that DMG's 2018 operating income will be up from 2017 adjusted operating income for several reasons. First, we expect $40 million in savings next year from the recent restructuring, as I just mentioned. Second, $30 million of revenue increases that reflect the patient acuity increase, as I mentioned before. Third, we expect to benefit from four risk contracts that have or are near signing in our new markets. Finally, we've been making progress in re-contracting with payers in our legacy markets and have signed or substantively agreed with payers on improvements in terms covering approximately 25% of existing Medicare Advantage risk business. Overall, we're optimistic about our ability to drive increased revenue per member per month in 2018. We expect all of the above should more than offset the 2018 Medicare Advantage rate headwinds we have previously disclosed. For 2019 operating income, we continue to see reasonable scenarios that deliver operating income greater than $200 million through the four levers we discussed at our May Capital Markets Day despite the reduced expectations for 2017. Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter. As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the team's passion, dedication, compassion and professionalism in a time of real crisis. From working multiple shifts back-to-back to rescuing stranded patients in their boat so they can be dialyzed, to traveling cross-country to allow the local team to take care of their displaced families. It was truly an inspiring period with heroic behavior from very caring teammates. Now onto the quarter. We had solid results for Kidney Care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, up approximately $3 million or 1% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra treatment day. Our adjusted operating income included the negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which we estimate to be approximately $7 million of higher cost and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from missed treatment and uncollected revenue from disruption to our billing process. The hurricane negatively impacted our non-acquired growth by approximately 25 basis points for the quarter, leaving our non-acquired growth for the quarter at 3.3%. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to be within the range of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis, although we will likely be near the lower end of the range for 2017. Revenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis and lab business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and we expect revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat for the fourth quarter. Our patient care cost was up approximately $1.76 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, which, as mentioned, approximately $1 of that per treatment was due to the hurricane impact. Now I'm going to transition to proactively address three topics : charitable premium assistance, payer contracting and guidance. Let me start with charitable premium assistance. As you know, we recently released information concerning our exposure to charitable premium assistance. I want to take this opportunity to summarize the four most important points. Point number one, charitable premium assistance has been critical support for the neediest patients, who are forced to navigate through an extremely complicated insurance environment. Point number two, we think charitable premium assistance is unlikely to go away for many reasons. Point number three, even if charitable premium assistance were to go away for dialysis patients, we believe that a large number of patients would likely retain their existing coverage, despite facing significant financial hardship. Point number four, if this unlikely scenario plays out, we estimate approximately $100 million to $250 million of downside risk to our annual operating income. Because we provided a lot of color in our press releases, I will leave additional comment for Q&A. For the last couple of quarters, we have also received some questions around the payer environment, so I want to provide additional color and try to be as helpful as I can. As we review the portfolio for 2018, we don't see anything to call out as unusual. So can I provide a little bit more detail? What does this mean? Four out of our five largest payers have rates locked in for the next two to three years, and we're currently negotiating the fifth in the normal cadence of renewals. For the smaller regional players, we continue to have normal give-and-takes in negotiations, so some will end up and some will end up down. On to guidance. For 2017, we're tightening our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion from the previous guidance of $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. The new range includes the negative financial impact of the hurricane. Next, given there are so many moving pieces in the business, we want to be as helpful as I can here and break from the recent practices of providing guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. First, a reminder. We will have a year-over-year accounting headwind of $100 million in 2018 for our recent transition to 401(k) match program. Nevertheless, we expect operating income for the Kidney Care business to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2018. In our guidance, it's worth calling out three elements, which we have considered in the forecast, but they're harder to handicap. Number one, open enrollment for ACA plans. Given all the regulatory uncertainty, it's hard for us to forecast individual patient decisions. Point number two, cost of the MEDICs. We don't have clarity around price, cost and volume yet. And then lastly, advocacy in California. As you know, the labor unions have proposed a ballot initiative that would significantly alter our economics in the state of California. If they decide to proceed with the initiative, we might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support our advocacy efforts, which we have not included in our stated guidance range. Longer term, we continue to expect the multiyear trajectory to be consistent with what we said at Capital Markets Day earlier this year. Now I'll give it back to Joel to discuss international. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Javier. For this quarter, adjusted international operating losses were $8 million, which includes $1 million foreign exchange loss and excludes higher equity losses of $6 million due to goodwill impairment at the APAC joint venture and restructuring charges of $3 million. This restructuring charge is related to a reorganization of our international operating structure to improve efficiency and reduce our G&A by eliminating some redundancy across the global, regional and country level. We expect this restructuring to save approximately $6.5 million per year in international cost starting in 2018. For full year 2017, we reaffirm international OI guidance we provided last quarter. Looking forward, we continue to expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. As we said last quarter, whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017. As mentioned in Capital Markets Day, we're building a solid platform for growth in our international businesses. Finally, some comments on cash generation and capital deployment. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the quarter and $1.56 billion year-to-date. Cash flow continues to be strong despite the adverse impact of a temporary increase in DSO of four days over the last two quarters due to the following; as a reminder, one day of DSO translates to approximately $30 million in operating cash flow. So the four days were the result of three things. First, receivables inherited in the Renal Ventures acquisition, which contributed about 1.5 days; second, delays in submitting claims from centers impacted by the hurricanes, which contributed another 1.5 days; and third, normal fluctuations, which contributed one day. We expect our DSOs to decline three to four days over the next few quarters as we work through these items. Separate from these short-term DSO increases, we have also seen a structural increase of dialysis and lab DSOs of approximately three days over the past year due to changes we have made to our collection processes. These include changes to our billing processes for government payers, anticipating changes in regulatory requirements as well as changes in billing frequency for certain commercial payers to reduce collection costs at the expense of a slight increase in working capital. We continue to expect operating cash flow for 2017 to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Now, over to Kent for a few closing comments. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Joel. I'd like to offer a few thoughts on three topics. Number one, DMG; number two, CPA; number three, capital deployment with respect to share buybacks. While it was a solid quarter for Kidney Care, it was an extremely disappointing quarter at the DaVita Medical Group, as you no doubt, have already noted. It is difficult at this point to find any words that are useful to the capital markets given our continuous failure to meet the expectations we have previously set. This reality is exacerbated by the fact we still believe in the value and potential of these assets and teams. Nonetheless, the results are the results. We are intensely focused on affecting a change in the burden that DMG performance is placing on the enterprise, your enterprise, through both strategic and operating initiatives. We would like to reiterate what we said in May at our Capital Markets Day. We are pursuing strategic alternatives for underperforming assets across our businesses and across markets. Steps like the $40 million G&A reduction that Joel discussed are still in our control; many others involve third parties and therefore are difficult to time. I'd like now to move on to charitable premium assistance, CPA. First and most importantly, our teammates acted ethically with respect to our charities and our patients. CPA is unambiguously good for ESRD patients who are among the most in need. Charitable assistance has long been explicitly accepted and endorsed by the government, above board explicit, intentional, and it was intentionally expanded by the Affordable Care Act. We have a responsibility, both regulatory and ethical, to comprehensively educate our patients. And as to any notion that commercial insurers are unfairly burdened by the aggregate regulatory ecosystem of the ESRD system is ridiculous. There are two subsidies that cut the other way that dramatically outweigh any incremental burden from charitable premium assistance on commercial insurers, namely the Medicare entitlement for patients under 65 and the 30-month limitation of Medicare Secondary Payer statute or commercial coverage. Our patients are the only Americans discriminated against in this way unable to keep commercial coverage that they would like to keep and have the ability to pay for. Most important, of course, in all of this is our teammates continue to provide amongst the best clinical quality care to dialysis patients in America. We will continue to advocate for our patients to be taken care of by the system. Finally, regarding stock buybacks. We have continued to do them. We have been deploying a considerable amount of our durable cash flow towards our long-term capital allocation strategy, which has manifested itself in the form of these repurchases in recent months. In fact, since our last earnings call, we have repurchased nearly 8 million shares or approximately 4% of our outstanding stock and announced a new authorization with approximately $1.2 billion currently remaining. Year-to-date, this means year-to-date through November 7, that is, we have purchased approximately 11.4 million shares or about 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We think this was the right thing to do with your capital. Operator, would you please open up the line for Q&A? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. So I guess, one, when you think about the 2018 number for dialysis and basically we assume that you're kind of at the high end of the range and we throw in the $100 million stock comp change, you're looking to grow about 3%, it looks like ish OI next year in that business. And I guess you're talking about growing volumes organically at least that amount, actually more than that amount. So why wouldn't there be EBITDA growth more like in line with where the top line growth should be kind of in mid-single-digit next year? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Appreciate the question, Kevin. A couple of things. As you know, next year, Medicare reimbursement is only going up 0.5 and for every percentage point is roughly $40 million. So when you have that line not going up and you have the labor pressures that we have and the cost structure moving up, you just have some compression there. So the range that we gave you is consistent to support that. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I guess when we think about the DMG outlook, and then I guess I appreciate the complexity of the DMG business and the general rate pressure in that business over the last several years. And it's obviously more complicated than the relative sustainability of the dialysis business, but I guess the inability to forecast earnings from quarter-to-quarter, is this really surprising? I mean, as we think about this business over since you've owned it, does HCP have this problem before you owned it as far as quarterly visibility? Or is there something new in the way the business is being run or the factors influencing the business that make it difficult for you guys to consistently forecast just a quarter or two ahead? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I'll go ahead and take a stab at that, Kevin, and you let me know if it's sufficient. The two big changes in the last four or five years compared to the prior four or five are, one, the rate of annual Medicare Advantage rate increase benchmark rate type stuff, and then number two, in the case of HCP, a non-trivial increase in the weighted average acuity of their patient group during that same period. And what that meant is you could be off a fair amount in your medical loss ratio forecast or your unit growth forecast, but it would all be matched by your reimbursement per member per month increase. Because in the last four or five years, instead of increases in those two areas, there's been dramatic decreases totaling in the neighborhood of $275 million. I'm not going to get the number exactly right. Therefore, any adjustment or any miss on the medical loss ratio or unit growth front, even though it might be of exactly the same absolute magnitude as prior years has a dramatically bigger impact on the net remaining OI. And of course, it takes a while to restructure the business according to the new revenue reality. Is that responsive? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. And I guess the acuity side makes more sense to me. But I guess to the extent that there's always going to be this inherent delay between when your risk scores adjust to the acuity care you're seeing underlying basis, is there a reason to believe that the acuity dynamic this year is unusual in some way, or are you going to have the same issue where next year the acuity increases and you'll get last year's acuity boost, but you won't be able to factor in next year's acuity issues? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Excellent question, and let me try to step through it in a reasonable clear way. If there was the same kind of acuity increase every year, then there wouldn't be any year-over-year delta or it'd be very, very modest because every year would benefit from the prior year's acuity increase. But in fact, that's not the case. This year, there was a differential increase in acuity. And so in fact, we did incur a significant number of incremental medical costs tied to that higher acuity. Just to give you one reason for why that happened, we did a great job of dealing with an unusually high percentage of our patients who had flu issues and an unusual incidence of serious issues within that flu population in the first quarter. The derivative benefit from all that extra care in cost is that you actually capture a lot of other acuity developments that you would otherwise not have because you wouldn't have seen the patient for significantly longer period of time. So that's just one analytical sliver of the larger picture. So this was truly a discontinuous incremental increase in acuity. We don't have any reason to expect there to be another one the subsequent year. To be honest, from a long-term point of view, we would be happy if it happened again because while you suffer a relative deficit in the first year it happens because you're incurring the cost and the revenue is deferred, on average, we keep our patients for a long time and do great work with them. And so the actual net present value of this type of change in acuity is seriously positive. However, in the very first year it happens, you're eating the cost and none of the revenue. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that makes sense. And I guess maybe my last question, you talked about recontracting 25% of your MA risk business for next year. How should we think about that? Is that unusual? I guess you mentioned on the commercial side, you've announced that you've got a large contract signed up for two or three years. Is this 25% just normally happen or are you specing this out because you're saying this 25% are the real problem contracts and that's what you're talking about, first. And then second, what is it that you're doing? Is it really a rate recontracting or is there some other aspect that you're really looking forward to improve the profitability? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. So first, it's not normal course. It is something that we set out intentionally to do and accomplish this year, which we haven't done in the past. In terms of the second question about what exactly we're doing, it's I think the simplest way to think of it is increasing the percentage of premium that we are keeping relative to the percentage of premium that the payer with whom we're contracting keeps. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So that's it, just follow through it then to the bottom line from your perspective? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Exactly. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And Kevin, the only thing I would add there is our results this year are, as you all know, highly public. And so we go with great credibility to our payers in this context and point to the fact that we are a very high-value added and significant part of their network. And the industry is in a different spot now and there simply have to be adjustments in the revenue paradigm to adjust for the changes on the government reimbursement and cost side. Operator, could we go on to the next one, please? Operator : Sure. Our next question comes from the line of Tejus Ujjani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. It's actually Tejus Ujjani actually. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to go back to this workforce reduction in the DMG segment. You mentioned $40 million of annual operating impact or operating savings, and just trying to understand if this is a sustainable reduction in kind of overhead infrastructure, why wasn't it done in prior quarters or previously if the group had been underperforming for some time? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. So look, we have been thinking about the performance of the business for quite a while now. The decision to eliminate this many positions is not one you can run into quickly. There are puts and takes when you make decisions like this. And now is the point where we thought some of the operating changes that we had made had been established well enough that we could handle a change like this within the business without it hurting the overall operating performance. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And just kind of switching topics to the DaVita Rx. I think Javier had mentioned back in Capital Markets Day and it came up on the last call as well, a $70 million to $90 million EBITDA headwind for the pharmacy business in 2017. Can you just share any update on how much of that's actually occurred so far this year? How much you have incremental for the rest of the year? And if there's anything actually incremental in 2018 guidance? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. We are on the high-end of the range, but we are \u2013 so that number did hold up. And as it relates to 2018, we expect the economics to stay in the same range as they did in 2017. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. Thanks very much. And then just going back to, I think, one of the earlier questions about what's implied in core Kidney Care segment growth, given some of the top line pressures and wage pressures. I mean, it seems like you're saying that there's not really any operating leverage kind of going forward into next year in the Kidney Care segment. I mean, given the scale and size of the business, I mean, are all the costs really variable at this point? I mean, I guess any color on that would be helpful. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: No doubt about it that 2018 is not where we want to be. And 2019, the numbers are looking better, because we have the Medicare reimbursement and we have some visibility into other items that will look better in 2019 over 2018. We will, of course, work very hard to beat the number we have. But that is the right number to do at this juncture. And as I said, there's three big variables that we're going to get visibility into shortly here with open enrollment and in the cost of MEDICs. And so we will do our best to perform on those metrics. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. I'll hop back in the queue. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. So a few questions here. Wanted to first go back to premium assistance. And appreciate all the color you've given. Wanted to talk about your interaction with CMS on this, right. So they came out last year with something outside of the exchange reg that they later pulled back on. The exchange reg came out just recently, there was no mention at all of charitable premium assistance. So given that, I'm curious as to what is your interaction with CMS right now on this topic? Has it quieted down, given most of managed care is making significant profits on the exchanges now? Just give us some kind of an update, if you can? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And, Justin, I'll take a stab at this. Number one, I would say that there's a dramatic difference in how this administration at least so far is approaching the issue versus the prior administration, which is to say a lot more listening and developing a much deeper understanding of the nuances and the complexities, both generally on the issue and with respect to dialysis patients. That's a good thing. Second, they're also, as everyone knows, way behind in staffing up and missing some key leadership spots. Put all that together, it is not that the item has dropped off the agenda at all, but perhaps nothing is going to emerge for a while. It's very difficult \u2013 impossible would be a better word \u2013 to predict. You are also correct that because a whole lot of plans are doing better in the exchanges now than before and throughout this entire period, more people are noticing that they were making very substantial profits in most of their other lines of business, while at the same time complaining about the exchanges that that pressure has also abated somewhat. So I want to repeat. It's still on the agenda, both of the plans and of the administration. And we can't predict when they're going to do something. But the good news is, it's at least from a process point of view, far more measured than before. And we just don't know what to expect. We will continue to advocate for our patients who, as we mentioned in our preparatory remarks, this aspect of the dialysis and kidney care ecosystem has existed very explicitly and very intentionally for 25 years. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Then, Kent, in regards to DMG, as recently a September 7 at a conference, you said DMG had some nice momentum. So given the problems in the quarter, obviously the visibility in this business that I think you discussed before must be limited. How should we think about or educate ourselves on this? Your forward view of the business, given the interest from others you've talked about in acquiring it, and your discussion around strategic alternatives. Are there any other strategic alternatives for something like DMG, other than a sale of the business that we should consider? Or is that the main strategic alternative you're discussing? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, first as to the question you asked at the front end of your paragraph, we understand that you and others must have a very dim view of our confidence when it comes to forecasting, and there really is no other rational perspective for someone to have at this point. Second, as to the question, are there other strategic alternatives other than selling everything? The answer to that question is yes. There's different options in every single market as well as in aggregate. Of course, at the same time, we also recognize our fiduciary responsibilities to you and your associates. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : So can you give us anymore color on what those other strategic alternatives would look like? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, I'll just give one example so you get an idea. It could be that one would sell \u2013 create a separate equity vehicle in an individual market and have some of the local players become serious equity partners simultaneously enhancing the contract terms between us and them in an individual market. Just to give one example of a non-total sale that could change both the short-term economics of the business as well as derisk the business as well as liberate some capital. So I'm not advocating for that versus anything else. I'm simply answering your question as to what would be an example of an alternative strategic alternative to selling everything and then adding on top of it the follow-up question, which is, well, what would that do for shareholders? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : That's helpful. And then just lastly, before I jump back in. You brought 6 million shares in October despite knowing that DMG was having some clear issues. Can you give us some color around that decision? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Sure, Justin. It's Joel. We're, in general, not going to comment on our individual purchases over a given quarter or a month, but let me give you a little color about how we think about this. So in general, we like to use both open market purchases or 10b-18 purchases as well as planned purchases, 10b-51 purposes. They have different advantages and disadvantages. The open market gives us flexibility on a day-to-day basis to decide whether we want to buy or not depending on the stock price than anything else. The challenge there is the window does close at times, and we obviously can't trade when the window is closed, so that removes certain flexibility. The 10b5-1 solves the window issue, but it locks us in over a protracted period of time and we can't respond based on all the other factors. So we use both. When we do 10b5-1s, we tend to lean towards more complex plans to try and think forward about what's likely to happen, ensure that we're buying at opportune times. That said, there can be unintended consequences of the complexities of our 10b5-1 plans. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : So if I'm hearing that correctly, is it fair to say that you put that in place before the quiet period ended or began, I should say? And you have the information on the quarter, but maybe felt like the stock price at that time was interesting so you wanted to buy? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm going to leave it where I did in terms of the general guidance without getting into any of the specifics. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Robert Baird (sic) [Robert W. Baird] (40:56). Your line is open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. On this exchange topic, CMS mentioned Friday during a webinar with both navigators and payers that those eligible for Part A coverage or have Part B Medicare coverage should not be enrolling in marketplace plans or some language to that effect. I think we talked a little bit about this at my conference briefly. And this is, I think, the second time that they've sort of guided the payers and the navigators to this point. Do you just have any thoughts on the implications of this with the ESRD patients? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Whit, we're looking around the table here for a moment because none of us are feeling well equipped because we didn't know about this Friday statement and it's a fairly tricky area where you've got to be pretty damn precise. So LeAnne or Jim, do either of you have any ability to shed light on this, or do we just say we'll have to get back to you. We're not thinking we can do a great job, repeating stuff we've already said. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's fine. Okay. Jim, I'll send you the email. And maybe back to Joel's comment on some of the changes to the collection process, and I think you referenced anticipating some regulatory changes. Any color on specifically what you're referencing? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: This is Javier. Basically, we went through and reviewed the best way to do billing. We had a new billing system, and we changed some policies and procedures. So there's nothing from a regulatory perspective at how we're doing internally. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And looking at the Kidney Care guide, I think you signaled that the international losses or the ancillary losses, I guess, should be sort of breakeven. Is that generally the assumption that you've used to construct the 2018 guide? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry, I was writing down something. Could you repeat the question? Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Just the Kidney Care guidance for 2018, I'm just curious what the assumptions were for the ancillary business. I think you've consistently stated that you believe it can breakeven, and I was just looking to confirm whether or not that's exactly what you've assumed sort of within the range? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: We don't have an immediate answer. Why don't we have some people take a look and get back to you before this call is over, okay? Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's fine. And maybe just one last one here. Just back to DMG and the comment on higher utilization. I mean, I think you're the only person this quarter or in the past year for that matter citing higher utilization. Is that really acuity or are you really seeing utilization days per thousand go up? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: So it is acuity. What I would also remind you about us is given the nature of our business, we don't have the scale of the large payers, so we are rather localized. And while we are in six markets, we are dominated or we are heavily-weighted towards one market. And as a result, we don't have a diversification that some of the other larger managed care players you're talking about have. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And the other thing I would add, in some cases, if we're below average utilization in a market, and that's what we've been 18 months, and then we become less below average, for us, it actually shows up as an earnings decrement. But separate from that, LeAnne, you have an answer on the navigator question? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: Well, I think if I heard you correctly, you're saying that the navigator training is instructing navigators if a patient has enrolled in Medicare, they can't enroll in a QHP, which is true. So I think that may be the clarification. But unless I see the training, I couldn't respond beyond that, but happy to take a look at the training and give you any another color. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: No, I'll send it over just stating if someone is not enrolled and is eligible for Part A, you should direct them to Medicare and away from a market-linked plan (45:40), but I'll send it over, LeAnne. Thanks. LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. No problem. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: And then I just want to follow-up on the question you asked on the SIs in international. We don't guide in particular line, so it's included in our broad range. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. I'm disadvantaged from having Justin who had asked all the smart questions. So I'll weigh in with my weak stuff at the end. On the pharmacy, you put in your slides for reviewing assets strategically, that's a business of scale. That would seem to be kind of an easy one to see if someone else could maybe do it better because they like may buy a little cheaper. Why are you hanging onto that asset if it's going to continue to kind of boil in 2018 at these levels? I'm just curious about that. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for the question. On the pharmacy, it is a clinical story. And so when you look at the research and you look at the quantity of prescriptions that our patients take, so on average, a dialysis patient has 10 prescriptions and takes about 20 pills. So one of the big advantages is that we can consolidate and we could really help the patients on adherence. And then, of course, as you know, we did that business bottoms-up, so we didn't deploy a lot of capital. And so it's been a clinical story that's actually been an acceptable return on investment. So that's how we think about it. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I mean, is it making positive EBITDA at this point? I know its missing plan, but is it net positive EBITDA or is it negative EBITDA? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: It's got thin margins, but it is making money. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then my second question is, your sort of preliminary guidance for 2018, with all the puts and takes in managed care, how does the pricing, commercial pricing, compare in 2018 versus 2017? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I think what I gave is as far as I want to go, which is our portfolio is in what I'd call a normal state with a lot of our contracts being stable on the large account and the normal fluctuations of the small account. And that's as far as I'm going to go today. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But you made some cryptic comments Javier about 2019. What's better in 2019? I mean are you already seeing that play out? What's better in 2019 other than Medicare than we might see in 2018? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yes, I probably shouldn't have gone there. When I said it, I cringed. So unfortunately, you were paying attention at every word I said. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's a rare moment. That is actually a rare moment, so I'm going to take credit for that. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, well, I'm not going to regret and go further on that, but it's fair to say that I shouldn't have said it. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well, I guess what I'm trying to figure out with my simple mind is if you've got a clinic with 50 patients and you add two Medicare patients, and I know Medicare doesn't cover the total cost, it would seem like the marginal cost of treating a Medicare patient would be less than $250 which is about right on with your base. So I'm sort of questioning the operating leverage of the business if that isn't the case. And if that's not the case, are you rethinking maybe de novo spend? Because maybe the economics have gotten different in the business than what we've seen (49:36)? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. No, I get where you're going at, and this is obviously are we compressing margin. And if so, would we deploy capital in a different way? And so we are, of course, evaluating our capital deployment. And if the returns do go down, what we would do is, of course, we'll operate our centers at a higher utilization and so would everyone else. But what we have to look for 2019 is, number one, we wouldn't have the 401(k) headwind. And number two, Medicare is going back to normal increases. And so that will be a nice tailwind, back to normality on that. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And let me go backwards a second to the question about last Friday and CMS' comments. If their comments were precisely what we heard on this call, that would probably be a mistake by them. And if on the other hand, it was a comment they were making that pertained only to Medicare eligibles over age 65, it may not have been a mistake for them to say. So the devil is really in the detail on this. And we look forward to staring at it. And we'll follow-up with them if there needs to be any clarity. It is also not unusual for that population to just in general, lean philosophically towards Medicare for everything. And many of them think that Medicare should be the only program that covers all Americans, period. And so to have some sort of implicit bias is not at all surprising or new. For it to be explicitly decided as procedural guidance would be another thing entirely, and so we'll look into it, and thanks for bringing it up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood from Citigroup. Your line is open. Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you very much for taking my questions. I just have two please, if I may. And the first one would be on the ESCO savings. I'm just curious if these came in -for the data that CMS put out \u2013 if these came in roughly in line with where your guys were expecting the overall pool to come in? And also, long term, whether you think that that's a fair set of expectation going forward? Or if you think the industry can do a little bit better, given it's early days? And the second question is just appreciate on DMG that the confidence over the long term to still see that inflection up in the total EBIT level. The difficulty I've got is, and maybe I'm thinking about this simplistically, but a $600 million write-down is not a small proportion of the total value of that asset. How should we think about the fact that you're maintaining that outlook at the same time as writing down the asset. Just to give me some comfort around that would be helpful? Thanks, guys. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: First, let me take the ESCO question. I don't know how precise we were in the numbers, because the reality is that we are big supporters of integrated care, because we've done it for quite some time. And we know that when you have the comorbid condition that our patients have that it just makes sense that someone that is a quarterback of healthcare through all the transition, and when you have access to them for 12 hours, that you can bend the cost curve. So that being said, we were happy with the progress we made. We also have to highlight that it's a small population, so that number will fluctuate over time. And so it's going to be a bumpy up and down, because of the small size. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And let me just add that one of the fundamental architectural flaws in ESCO is \u2013 that rebounds to everyone's detriment is the open-ended black box of rebasing. And what this does is makes the long-term returns highly uncertain. And what that does is dramatically reduce the amount of transformational investment that people like us and FMC and others are willing to make to drive truly breathtaking improvements in the system where everybody would win. And so this is related to the answer to your important question of what can you expect from the ESCOs downstream. On to you, Joel, for the other question. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. So as you think about the goodwill impairment, there are many factors that go into that calculation. And while the performance in 2019 that we talked about is certainly one of them, there are many others, some more short term in nature. So while they certainly are not disconnected, there are a lot of things that go into the goodwill calculation other than our thoughts about 2019. Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Sure, appreciate it. Thanks so much for the color, guys. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. Had a couple questions. The first one, I just want to make sure I have this right. The implied fourth quarter Kidney operating income that would be comparable to the $404 million this quarter, I think the midpoint is $402 million. Do I have that correct? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: No. The midpoint would be closer to $400 million, but that's in the ZIP Code. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And so any incremental \u2013 I think the $404 million you're implying really would have been for 2018, including hurricanes, and so stepping down a little bit sequentially would be mainly driven by what? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: There are two main things in the fourth quarter. We have an escalation of benefit costs as the teammates run through their deductibles. And we have historically a higher G&A during the period. That explains the bulk of that difference. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I do have a CPA question for you, Kent. What we've heard from a number of plans is that they feel they're under no legal obligation to pick up the AKF funds and as they have rescinded some of these policies and refused to accept checks and wire transfers to AKF. Instead, they're now seeing a lot of these patients paying with a prepaid debit card, and in fact that those cards are going to the dialysis center care of patients and dialysis administrative personnel are helping these patients pay those premiums. And I guess my question is, given your view that this is an acceptable and sustainable part of the ecosystem, why is it necessary for the AKF to potentially hide the origin of that funding? And is there any business risk to DaVita in essentially being complicit in circumventing these plans' terms and conditions of coverage if they decided not to accept those payments? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, first, I'm not intimately familiar with what the AKF does, so we'll have to follow up. Second, there couldn't be anything more explicit and more public than provider funding of the AKF in the entire pantheon of American health care, and it's how it's been for 20 years. It's how the government approved it, consistent with criteria the government set down. But I cannot opine on exactly operationally how that comes up. I also know that the overwhelming majority of payers, a huge percentage, I'm not going to get the number right, but overwhelming majority probably understates it are continuing to process charitable premium assistance claims in the same way they did a year or two or three ago. And so whatever tiny subset of reality you may be discussing, I'm just not familiar with, but feel free to follow up with our team. But on the broader frame, the other statements I've made are highly, highly relevant. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll step back. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line's open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Appreciate getting back in the queue here. Just wanted to run through a bunch of numbers question here. First, if we go back into something in the neighborhood of $10 million $15 million, I think, from hurricanes, can you give us the exact hurricane OI impact in 3Q? And I apologize if you gave it already. And any impact assumed for 4Q that we should consider? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I couldn't hear the last part, but we did highlight that there was $14 million plus 25 basis on NAG. Was there something else that you said on the back end? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : So yes, is there a 4Q impact? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I am not sure of that. Let me look around. I think the bulk of its flushed through the quarter, but I'll verify here. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And is there any reason to think that shouldn't be coming back whatever it is the $14 million plus wherever the fourth quarter shouldn't come back next year, is there any kind of sustainable hurricane impact 2018 that we should consider? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. We are still assessing a couple of the centers, but the numbers should not be a meaningful number right now. And the number that they just gave me for the fourth quarter is in the range of $2 million to $3 million, Justin. So... Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Then getting back to the question around re-contracting benefits. You put pretty specific numbers around the savings from restructuring, the revenue increases from the risk scores as they go through. Is there any number that you can give us in terms of what you think the benefit will be from this re-contracting next year? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: We're going to stay away from giving a specific number on that. Some of that is still playing out over the balance of the year. So we'd rather not give a number. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then I just wanted to go back to the international question that Whit asked. I know you guys don't typically guide to the entire employer business, but you've been pretty specific in terms of international? So, can you give us what international the expected loss is this year on international first? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. So we said last quarter, and we're sticking with it, something in the low 30s of OI, excluding the onetime stuff. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : And should we expect that to get to breakeven next year? Is that what's implied in guidance cause you've been talking about getting to breakeven I think this year? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. So what's implied in our guidance is in 2018, we will get to breakeven. When during the year we get there and whether not we'll be breakeven for the full year really depends on the acquisition pace over the remainder of the year in 2018, but we believe we will get there at some point during the year. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Javier, you mentioned California, advocacy cost could impact next year. So just want to make sure I understand that from a perspective of did you say that there was some of that built into guidance? I thought you said that wasn't built into guidance. And so what's the answer there? And then is that something that you would consider a onetime charge and kind of strip out or is that something that you kind of look at as normal course of business? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: It is not built into the guidance, so that is correct. I don't think we would \u2013 from an accounting perspective, it wouldn't called out as a one-time charge, but we would view it as in year non-recurring, how's that? So we would tell you what that number is so you could carve it out. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : And you talked about as being somewhat meaningful impactful. Can you give us a ballpark on like would this thing really does kick up with 2018 what the impact of it? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: The numbers are all over the place, and these campaigns can really go up and down. So it's really hard to give you a number, Justin.

Baird & Co. John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates Inc. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Gary Taylor - Raymond James & Associates Inc. Operator : Good evening. My name is Eric, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And, Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, Eric, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings release out earlier today and our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent Thiry : Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you out there for your continued interest in our enterprise. We are first and foremost a clinical care-giving company. And as is our custom, I'll start with talking about clinical spotlight before I move into a high-level summary; and then, Joel and Javier will take care of the follow-up. Flu, as we've seen in all the major media is the leading cause of hospitalizations in general and even more so in the ESRD population. The current flu season is especially severe, vaccinations significantly reduce the risk even in a difficult year like this and we vaccinated over 94% percent of our patients, which is a very distinctive percentage, and many years in a row where we have outperformed the norm in this all-important category. Now, onto a high-level summary of the quarter itself. It was a good quarter for DaVita Kidney Care. And we carry solid amount into 2018 and 2019. There's a lot of noise in this quarter's numbers due to a bunch of factors including the DMG sale and tax reform, and Joel will step through a bunch of that to help you navigate. But the bottom line is it was a good quarter. We have good operating momentum. And we continue to generate strong cash flows and we will deploy a significant amount of those cash flows towards share repurchases as the quarters roll on. Onto Javier, for DaVita Kidney Care. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Let me dive right in. I'll provide some details on the main drivers of the business and Joel will cover the financial results in more detail. First, our non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.5%, approximately flat versus the third quarter of 2017 after normalizing for the impact of the hurricanes. Next, net dialysis revenue per treatment came in consistent with recent quarters, as we think about 2018. I'd break it down between government and commercial revenues. As you know, 2018 Medicare rates updates is essentially flat and will be a headwind for margins for all dialysis providers. As it relates to commercial revenues, there tends to be two questions : is there anything new on charitable premium assistance and how is the commercial environment? We believe that there's very little going on around the country on charitable premium assistance. And as it relates to the contracting environment, the conversations are back to their normal puts and takes. Onto the cost side, like many other companies, we are experiencing a tight labor market with upward wage pressure. We continue to expect a 2% to 3% annual increase and don't see significant opportunity to offset this with productivity improvement in the near term. With labor cost inflation - sorry, with labor cost inflation continuing to outpace Medicare reimbursement, we will continue to feel margin pressure in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service business in 2018. With normal Medicare updates scheduled to resume in 2019, we expect these margin pressures to subside. Finally, we continue to be excited at the prospect of transforming patient care in the dialysis industry through PATIENTS Act. We currently have an unusual amount of bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress with more than 150 Cosponsors. We believe we have a real shot in getting this bill passed this year, but as always a significant lift to get transformative legislation passed. To wrap up 2017, we ended the year with adjusted operating income for kidney care of $1.616 billion, above our most recent 2017 adjusted guidance of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion. Joel, will go into more detail on this in a moment. On to 2018 guidance, because of the pending DaVita Medical Group transaction, our Kidney Care guidance effectively becomes our guidance for operating income from continuing operations. For 2018, we continue to expect operating income of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for Kidney Care business. As a reminder, we have a one year over year accounting headwind of up to $100 million, as we finish the transition from profit share program to a 401(k) match program. With the old program, we accrued for the expenses in the calendar year before the pay-up. With the new program, we will accrue for the expenses as we pay it out. This accounting change created a one-year gap in 2017, when we did not need to accrue for such payout. To close out my remarks, I would like to follow-up on three variables that we discussed last quarter that could swing 2018 forecast. First, open enrollment period was in line with our initial expectations, we'll continue to monitor as the numbers slope throughout the year, and we'll keep you posted. Second, onto pharmaceuticals, as we have discussed before, calcimimetics, a drug, which taken by many ESRD patients to treat mineral bone disease just moved into our dialysis reimbursement with introduction of an injectable drug called Presibib [ph]. Reimbursement in the cost of calcimimetics are coming in line with expectations, but it's still too early to understand the full picture, until we get more data and volume and product mix. Physicians make individual prescription physicians based on each of the patients' needs to how they'll view the new drug option is very difficult to predict. Our view of the most probable range of outcomes continues to be included in our guidance and we plan to provide an update when we gain better visibility. Third, onto the ballot initiative being pursued by the union in California, we won't have much to report into later this year, and we have not included potential advocacy costs, in our guidance range. If initial - if the initiative does pass, we believe that it would have material adverse impact on the entire industry in California, it would likely make a large number of centers in California, financially unsustainable, which would severely limit patient access to outpatient dialysis care. We have also become aware that the unions pursuing a similar initiative in Ohio. We have not included any potential advocacy costs in Ohio in our guidance range either. Now onto our CFO Joel for financial results and details. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, Javier. I will start with an overview of the financial results for the Kidney Care business as reflected in our continuing operations. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter plus $430 million, up approximately $26 million or 6% versus the third quarter, although, the fourth quarter benefited from a couple of items that are outside our run rate. First, we've recognized $14 million shared savings revenue that our DaVita Health Solutions business earned throughout 2017. Second, we had $9 million onetime benefit in insurance expenses due to revaluation our reserves. As a reminder, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, but this figure was negatively impacted by approximately $14 million due to the hurricane season. The fourth quarter was shorter by one-half treatment day relative to the third quarter, which accounts for most of this difference. For our U.S. dialysis and lab business, our reported revenue per treatment net of provision for bad debt was up $0.49 per treatment quarter-over-quarter. Underlying this are two largely offsetting unusual items. First, we've recognized approximately $20 million in cash receipts that we have previously reserved that flow through the gross revenue line. This was offset by $23 million increase in our provision for bad debts to address our higher estimates of patient pay receivable write-offs for all of 2017. To comply with the new revenue accounting standard, starting with the first quarter of 2018, you'll start to see a few changes and additions to our disclosures. I want to highlight two in particular. First, we will only be reporting revenue per treatment net of provision for bad debt. Second, we expect to recognize the benefit of approximately $30 million in the first four months of 2018 from a change and how we account for Medicare bad debt recoveries. Prior to 2018, we've recognized these recoveries only after attempting to collect, which takes approximately four months. Under the new rules, we will estimate and recognize estimated Medicare bad debt recoveries at the time of treatment. I refer you to our Form 10-K to be filed later this month for additional details. Our patient care costs were down approximately a $0.11 per treatment quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, our patient care cost in the third quarter of 2017 was higher by approximately $1 per treatment due to the hurricane impact. U.S. dialysis and lab segment G&A costs were down approximately $1.69 per treatment sequentially due to lower outside professional fee expense and normal quarterly fluctuations. For fiscal 2017, G&A was approximately 3% per treatment - was down approximately 3% per treatment year-on-year. As G&A always had some quarterly variability, the annual G&A per treatment is a better result to use for your go-forward modeling. Lastly, please keep in mind that our first quarter tends to be the weakest quarter of the each year due to seasonality with two fewer treatment days in Q4 flu impacts and higher payroll taxes. A few words on the DMG sale, as a reminder we announced in December that we entered into an agreement to sell DaVita Medical Group to Optum. We are working with Optum on required regulatory approvals and continue to target closing in 2018. It has been a very productive working relationship and we look forward post close to the additional long-term benefit that the business will get from our relationship with Optum and United. Because of the pending transaction, the DMG business has been reclassified as held for sale and the results of operations are reported as discontinued operations. In addition, prior period presentations have been revised to conform to current year presentation. In the fourth quarter, DMG generated operating loss of $23 million. This includes operating results, which were negatively impacted by a bad flu season and both direct and indirect financial impact from the transaction, including the shift to held for sale accounting. In addition, we recognized the tax benefit of $164 million in order to recognize deferred tax assets require upon the classification of DMG as held for sale. The net impact of all these items is that we reported $144 million gain as one line on the income statement as discontinued operation. On to international, our strategy is evolving under the direction of the new leadership, the result has an increased focus on core markets, where we are well positioned to achieve scale and drive clinical and financial value. Also, as we discussed last quarter, we restructured our international organization to streamline our reporting structure and reduce administrative cost, and anticipate this will save $6.5 million in annual G&A expense in 2018. As a result of these strategic changes, including changes in expectations concerning the JVs available market opportunities. We are taking a non-cash write-down of our investment in the Asia Pacific JV up $280 million, which reverse is much of the $381 million non-cash gain we booked in 2016 and 2017 from the creation of this joint venture. Adjusted operating losses from our international business was $46 million for fiscal year 2017, which included $2 million in impairment charges, $4 million in prior period adjustments and $8 million in foreign currency losses. This was in line with revised guidance that we had provide - previously provided for 2017. As we have discussed in recent quarter, we expect to achieve breakeven operating income in late 2018. This is incorporated in our enterprise guidance for continuing operations for 2018. Next some information on taxes, to account for the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation passed in December, we've recognized one-time reduction of tax expense of $252 million in the quarter. This is the net gain to remeasured our deferred assets and liabilities to reflect our expected go forward tax rate. Excluding this and other one-time items, our adjusted effective tax rate on continuing operations was 40.4% in the quarter and 39.1% for 2017. As we continue to review the impact of the recently announced tax reform, we now expect our effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2018 to be 26.5% to 27.5%. Despite moving up to bottom end of the range by 50 basis points, we continue to expect 2018 income tax expense reduction of $110 million to $130 million from tax reform. Now cash flow, enterprise operating cash flow for 2017 was $1.907 billion, within our previously provided guidance. For 2018, we will provide cash flow guidance for continuing operations in light of our expectation that the DMG sale will close this year. We expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This guidance reflects the benefit of tax reform from both the lower effective tax rate and the accelerated depreciation of certain capital expenditures. This cash flow guidance excludes any cash flows from DaVita Medical Group, although investors should keep in mind that we will still own the cash flows from this business, up until the date the transaction closes. In 2018, we expect to spend $925 million in CapEx on continuing operations, roughly evenly split across maintenance and development CapEx. This is an increase of approximately $100 million from 2017. But most of this increase is due to expenditures we do not expect to recur in 2019. So holding all else equal, we expect our CapEx in 2019 to be closer to our 2017 levels. For the full year 2017, we repurchased 13 million shares of our common stock or nearly 7% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. During Q4 2017, we re-purchased 7.4 million shares. We have also repurchased approximately 900,000 shares this year through February 12, 2018. Now, I'll turn it over Kent for some closing remarks. Kent Thiry : If you'll excuse a little bit of redundancy, I'll make three points before we turn to Q&A. Number one, it's early in the process, but the DMG transaction is proceeding on track. Number two, it was a good quarter for DaVita Kidney Care, and they have good operating momentum. And this reflects the fact that we continue to have a very solid platform in DaVita Kidney Care, our U.S. Kidney Care business. Third and finally, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows and we expect to be thoughtful in the deployment of this cash to benefit you, through a combination of share repurchases, substantial continued Kidney Care growth and a limited number of investments in other healthcare service areas. On to Q&A please. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I wanted to maybe follow up on the last comment about capital priorities, I guess, specifically the commentary about investments on the healthcare services. Any color you can provide there about the types of things that you might be looking at or how limited those investments might be? I think it's an area of some questions based upon how DMG didn't play out. We're trying to understand how far field you might be looking to go with these other investments. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So, I'll take that. Kevin, it's Joel here. So a few thoughts, first, we're thinking about this from a sector perspective, not from a deal perspective. We want to find sectors where we think we can evolve them over the next few decades, the way we have helped shape the Kidney Care sector over the past few decades. Second, we are hyper-focused on opportunities where we can add value, where we can take the core competencies we have developed over many decades and apply them to new sectors and new businesses. Third, we know some things we don't want to do. We are not going to become a health insurance company. We're not going to get into drugs or devices. We're not going to get into the hospital business, so healthcare service is a bit more narrowly defined than you might otherwise think. And finally, in terms of your question about scale, we're not looking at multi-billion-dollar deal, so we don't have a specific range. But I think it is safe to say, you're not going to see something at or near the scale of the DMG transaction. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That's helpful. I guess, is there a way to think about it from the DMG proceeds. Is there - say, that the majority of it would be spent on share repurchase or is that not something that you can really definitely say at this point? Joel Ackerman : Sure, so what we have said and continue to believe, first is we will pay down debt. We haven't changed our guidance around the range. And we expect to pay debt down to get back into the - our traditional range. Second, the majority of the remainder will be used for share repurchases. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, I think you talked about 3, 3.5 times leverage. But then I think you also talked about being comfortable at the higher end of that range. Is that - is it 3.5 that you're talking about or the midpoint of that range? How do we think about that? Joel Ackerman : So it's a complicated number, because after the deal closes there may be a period of distortion. How the share buybacks play out in reality remains to be seen and there's certainly a possibility that we will keep cash on the balance sheet to facilitate that over time, because the leverage level that we've talked about are always net, net of cash that excess cash on the balance sheet could create some distortion. But normalizing for that, we - again, we expect to be in that 3 to 3.5 range. Where exactly in that range we wind up remains to be determined over time. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then, last question for me, the sale of DMG. Is there anything that we should think about as far as stranded costs or things that couldn't be put as discontinued operations that either cost that can come out once that sale actually happens or that might be a drag prospectively after the sale happens? Joel Ackerman : So I think it is safe to think of the continuing operation number that we are guiding you to as the forward runway - forward run rate, excuse me. We have worked hard and we will continue to work hard to ensure that there are no material stranded costs or dissynergies associated with the sale of DMG. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great. Thanks. Kent Thiry : And, Kevin, I would add on the leverage ratio that we have made statements over the prior six months, nine months, whatever, saying within the context of our historical statements and guidance that we were leaning in a more positive way towards being higher and lower within that range. I think at this point, given everything that's going on in the markets the last month or two with respect to interest rates et cetera, I don't know if that particular refinement to the guidance is really still - is really still in place. So I think what you're looking at is, basically we're going to bring the same attitude and flexibility to it that we brought for a long time. Kevin Fischbeck : Right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake. Your line is open. Justin Lake, please check your\u2026 Justin Lake : Sorry about that. Yeah, sorry about that. So first question, I just wanted to try to get as much color as I can on CapEx. Now, that you've got or in the process of divesting DMG, you talked about CapEx of $925 million, I guess, $825 million is more the run rate you want us to think about longer term. I compare that to a depreciation number that's closer to $500 million. And I just want to understand the use of cash here. Can you break that down, that $825 million, let's say, run rate too for us in any way in terms of maybe U.S. versus international, maybe some numbers around the - with the cost to develop new centers verses just other areas beyond maintenance and developing new centers that we should be thinking about? Kent Thiry : Sure, so let me see if I can help out. We're not going to break out international. But as I said in the script, that number splits roughly evenly between maintenance and development. I think an important component to understand about the development is we have done more and more self-development of our clinics over time. And what that means is we build the clinic and then we sell it. We believe that drives a cost savings on the construction of the clinic. What I would point you to in the cash flow statement is a line called proceeds from asset sales, which is a positive cash flow number associated with the sale of the self-developed clinics. And as you are thinking about the total picture of our cash flow, I think, it is fair to incorporate that positive complete piece of the cash flow in to the overall thinking. Justin Lake : Okay, Joel. Is there - in terms of the development dollars, can you tell us what those development dollars? I'm just trying to understand - what like - how do you think of our capital from the perspective of returns on capital? Just given how much more significant the CapEx is here versus your run rate depreciation, and relative to your total cash flow you're generating? Joel Ackerman : So in terms of how we think about capital deployment, look, we've got a very structured approach to how we think about capital and whether it drives a wide growth and appropriate return on capital. The development is the biggest component of that is building new clinics. And those historically have been a high return on capital investment for us. So I don't know that a whole lot has changed around that. Justin Lake : Okay. Just last question on this. What is the cost for developing new clinic, right now? Joel Ackerman : Roughly $2 million. Justin Lake : Okay. So that's what runs through CapEx for new clinic development? Joel Ackerman : Roughly. Justin Lake : Okay, great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Morgan. Your line is open. Frank Morgan : Good afternoon. My question surrounds the growth in the international. Obviously, you had the charge on the Asia Pacific JV, but does that in any way change your view over international growth and when do you really start to see the international business growth? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : So no. It doesn't change the view of international growth. I would split the growth into two components, revenue growth and OI growth. The revenue growth as you can see from the reported results continues to be relatively high from an OI perspective, which is probably what you're more interesting of, and we standby what we've said last quarter, which is we expect to get to breakeven in the later part of 2018. So from a year-over-year perspective, you'll see significant growth. Frank Morgan : Got you. Maybe one more, as Kent made referenced to commercial pricing. And I'm just curious as you go through the commercial pricing and contracting, are there any significant contracts that are left out there that need to be negotiated? And then are you seeing any change in the appetite of these commercial players to look at value based elements in their contracting? Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. There is nothing to highlight as unresolved on the payor contracting, we have normal renewals that come up, but I wouldn't point anything out. If anything, we are more contracted right now, meaning that there's less renewals than usual. And as it relates to value-based - it really depends on the payor and their appetite of how to structure the contracts that we are seeing the wide range of nothing all the way to P4P et cetera. So there's not been a material change in the structure of our contracts. Frank Morgan : Okay. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Whit Mayo. Your line is open. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Maybe just starting on the Kidney Care business, the cost per treatment was down over $4 year-over-year, one of the lowest numbers we've seen in two years and besides from perhaps the Amgen purchasing contracts. Are there any other factors worth mentioning, I think you referenced some hurricane distortion from the third quarter? But is there anything else to call out? Javier Rodriguez : There is two pieces. The Amgen thing that you mentioned on EPOGEN in the 401(k) $100 million that we discussed on the front end of the call, we did not incur approximately $100 million of what we used to call profit share in our 401(k). Whit Mayo : Great. Okay, helpful. And then G&A same thing down 10% year-over-year on a per treatment basis, and I think, I heard you referenced lower professional fees. Any more color you can share and just how sustainable that number is as we look at 2018? Javier Rodriguez : The number we have is a little different on a per treatment basis, but we're seeing is that when you annualize the number, it's roughly in the $27 per treatment, and we expect that to be in that range. I don't think there is anything to call out on professional fees. Whit Mayo : Okay. Must just be having a bad number here and maybe two other quick ones real quick. On the topic of calcimimetics, I'm just kind of curious what the feedback has been from your nephrology partners at this point, and you have any sense of reference at this point, were they're leaning, what the pros and cons of the IV versus the oral drugs are? Javier Rodriguez : We do not. We have very little data right now. And as you know, there is going to be a lot of variables in this one category, because we have both an oral going into IV. It's going to go from Part D as in dog to Part B as in boy. And then the oral is going to have an introduction of generics. So there is going to be a lot of moving pieces right now, and I think physicians are wanting to see publications, and seeing how this plays out in the marketplace. So right now, we are not seeing a lot of change yet. Whit Mayo : And when this - because the drug is now reimbursed under Part B, can DaVita Rx play a role in dispensing this drug? Javier Rodriguez : DaVita Rx is dispensing the drug now. Whit Mayo : Okay. And - that's it. That's all I got. Thanks, guys. Javier Rodriguez : And just to clarify, that's the oral drug\u2026 Whit Mayo : That's dispensing? Javier Rodriguez : \u2026that's dispensing. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ransom. Your line is open. John Ransom : Hey, good afternoon. A couple of things for me, I may have missed it. But did you call of this pharmacy? How should we think about the pharmacy year-over-year comparisons, and your 2018 guidance versus your 2017? You mentioned that was a tough year for that business. Joel Ackerman : Yeah, I think the way that we've talked about Rx right now will hold, which is the changes we had from 2016 to 2017 will be in our run rate. And then of course, because of all the things that we've explained in the past, I won't go through each and every other category. And so we - of course, we're monitoring all the things are happening in the pharma space, and as you know some drugs will go generic and so on and so forth. So we will monitor what that does to our economic model. But we of course keep going back to the clinical piece of it, and how much we like it when our patients have 10 prescriptions and 20 pills medication management is a real gift to us. But of course, we have to make the economic model work. John Ransom : So in other words very minimal EBITDA in 2018 not much 2017, so the macro environment, you're really not able to may contribute that, just given some of the issues in the macro environment? I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but that's what I think I heard you saying. Joel Ackerman : No. What I'm saying is that the environment is quite dynamic. And we will continue to monitor it and adjust, but we continue to like the story that it's for the patient and managing this, and of course, we have to make the economics works for all our constituents. John Ransom : Okay. The second question is, I mean, this is a tougher sounding question and I mean it, but just looking at the pharmacy, looking at international, looking at DMG, looking at international - yeah, I said international. It's hard to conclude that any of that has just been wonderful success. So when you stray outside your core. So I guess, I'm just wondering why you think the aforetime will be the charm as you start looking at other areas of healthcare service? I know you rolled out a bunch of stuff, but it doesn't look like that has been a great experience so far. But, look, I know people who have been married five times. So there's always hope. I just was wondering what lessons learned, and why you want to go back to that particularly well. Kent Thiry : Yeah. It's Kent here, John. That's a very fair question, and I mean, go ahead and throw some thoughts and then you feel free to further follow-up. First, the DMG was a very disappointing performance. Having said that, we took a lot of cash out along the way, and also had some nice benefits from the Kidney Care side during the period in which we owned it in terms of enhancing our integrated care capability. But it doesn't change the fact that it was disappointing in the end. The - it's important to remind people, by far, the primary driver the disappointing performance were reimbursement reductions, not operating performance. And clearly very thoughtful other people felt it was still a very valuable asset with a live upside potential. And people who know the business as well or better than anyone. But the short-term, and the immediate operating performance was what it was, largely driven by the reimbursement cuts, and then, we decided was in your best interest rather than continue to pursue what we still think was very substantial long-term potential in which several other people thought had a lot of long-term potential, because it was reflected in the multiple they paid. But rather than do that, it was in a risk adjusted basis better for us to do take the return on capital now in addition to the return on capital we earned along the way. And then, on Rx it has been a big clinical success, and has had around of several profitable years in addition to being a strategic asset, we will see what happens now, but by many measures up to this point, it's been a very good success and a very important part of our Kidney Care portfolio. And now there's an awful lot going on in the pharma space that wouldn't have been predictable three, four, five years ago. And then just as a more conceptual question without going into international in detail then we do think, we've learned a lot from the experiences we've had, and it's important to look at the root cause of why they turned out, where they did. And just as there are times you can buy something, have it do quite well, and it's not a reflection of exactly what your deal premises were, what's your operating performance was, and you don't want to persuade yourself that you're brilliant at that point. So we think it's in the best interest - the best long-term interest of our shareholders to deploy a fraction of our cash flow towards, so you're looking at new long-term growth opportunities. In the same way that, 18 years ago, we decided that dialysis despite the fact it had a lot of works and some people had lost a bunch of money was worth sticking with, and our business model was worth sticking within. And we are very happy that we made that call 16, 17, 18 years ago, where it would have been easy to cut our losses and leave it. John Ransom : Thanks, Kent. My other question is, just going back to the question on CapEx. I guess, I was thinking wrongly as it turns out, but given that you're selling DMG and give that you're kind of narrowing your focus on international. We have thought maybe CapEx would perhaps step down a bit from where it had been. So should we think about you're taking what your spending international and DMG. And you're doubling down on those things. Just because it looks like CapEx - I mean, obviously, your sales going up this year. The significant [ph] stay flat. It just surprising to me this staying flat given that you're paring down in there in your focus? Kent Thiry : Well, let me just make one comment. Just recall that DMG was a business with very positive cash flow characteristics, meaning they're net cash flow relative to CapEx, et cetera. Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So I don't think we commented from that angle of saying, how are we going to redeploy cash that we might have deployed somewhere else. It's much more of a question of what are the options for this cash flow between paying down debt returning to the shareholders making new investments or investing in Kidney Care. So that's the angle we commented from. And with all those angles we use kind of a similar lens, which says, is this kind of drive OI growth and is this going to drive attractive risk adjusted returns on capital. John Ransom : So I mean, in the CapEx, that DMG was non-zero, I don't think you ever disclosed it. I don't know why I had $100 million number in my mind. Is that - am I thinking about that wrong? Kent Thiry : I don't know that we disclosed it. And offhand, I don't think anyone of us know. And we wouldn't say anything without wanting to confirm its accuracy, and that we had the right definition. So I'm afraid for both the reason that we'd have to make sure we nailed down the definition and not sure what we've disclosed historically, we can't answer right off the cuff here. John Ransom : It's a lot easier to [see it from the help without the regard for facts to get off it and in my life quite frankly] [ph]. All right, I understand. All right, thanks so much. That's all for me. Kent Thiry : All right, thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Clive. Your line is open. Lisa Clive : Hey, thanks. Two question for me. Could you give us just an update on where ACA sign-ups actually came in? How many were on the exchange? How many off the exchange? Am I right that you had about 3,000 patients on and off exchange, once the Medicaid patients sort of went away? And something like 1,800 of those had premium support. I'm just curious as to what the latest numbers compare versus those historicals. And also, are you expecting any clarity through new rules from CMS on the guidelines around premium support for the ACA plans? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, thanks, Lisa. Your numbers that you recited are the numbers that we disclosed several months ago. And we're not going to keep updating those. Those numbers are pretty stable. So there is not a big story in those numbers, is probably the right way to think about it. And as it relates to a rule, as I said in the earlier comments, we're not seeing a lot. The one thing, the one dynamic that really appears, that momentum is that both providers and government would like clarity as to how we provide the education. And so, we all want to do it the right way. And so, we will see how - what vehicle that comes in. But we don't have any additional information as to whether there is going to be rule making or not. Lisa Clive : Okay. Thanks. And then a final question. Could you just give us an update on your thinking about ESCO? Clearly, the financial structure is not deal. It's retrospective and Medicare has a lot of leeway in terms of what the benchmarks are. But the initial results you've achieved have been pretty good. And I know the Patient Care Act is making its way through D.C. But I'd imagine that probably wouldn't establish a new payment framework for several years. So what do you do in the meantime around integrated care? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, and we would like the PATIENTS Act. And if the bill passes, actually it has to start in 2019. So it would be pretty much a very quick ramp-up. If the PATIENTS Act doesn't pass, we of course, will stare at the options, whether we want to grow the ESCOs or not. Right now, the ESCO enrollment is not open. And so, we will have to see what CMS guides us on and where we stand if we don't get the PATIENTS Act. Lisa Clive : Great. Thanks very much. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor. Your line is open. Gary Taylor : Hi, thank you. Just a couple of quick tie-ups and then one question. If I could parse a bit, is that in the 2018 guidance, there is a good guy? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Gary Taylor : And if, I mean, care to quantify or not? Joel Ackerman : No, and for all the reasons I said it earlier in the conversation, which is there is a lot of variables right now for us to be helpful. But it is included in our guidance with all the normal handicapping we do to the numbers. Gary Taylor : Thanks. So want to make sure, you were ripping through some numbers pretty quickly. I want to make sure I get them correct. But in the fourth quarter, you were saying OI benefited from insurance reserve adjustment of $9 million and the $14 million of shared savings. That was all 4Q numbers, right? Joel Ackerman : That's right. Gary Taylor : And have you ever had shared savings number that you quantified before. And I guess, we're just trying to think about, should we think about next year and the fourth quarter, contemplating there might be something there? Kent Thiry : I would not. First, we have never reported anything like that before and I would not model in this as being a kind of a Q4 recurring event. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then on the bad debt, I'm trying to understand. You said there was about $20 million guy to gross revenue and $23 million bad guy on bad debt, both from some reconciliations. Were those - is there any color on like what was driving those? Were those in commercial revenue accruals or any help? Kent Thiry : Yeah, so the bad debt was associated with, largely driven by an increase in uninsured patients. The cash receipts, the offsetting item is associated with a reserve we typically take associated with commercial revenue. And it has proven that our reserve was a bit conservative, so we had a bit of - a onetime reserve release there. Gary Taylor : Got it. And then my last one, I mean, given that you are saying, you think commercial mix is pretty stable and you're back to a normal commercial rate environment, can you share what your expectations are for revenue per treatment growth in 2018, what's built into the guidance? We know Medicare is basically flat, so an overall basis what are you looking for? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, we have not guided on revenue per treatment and we're not going to start right now. So I think the best thing to do is just keep to the OI range for now. Gary Taylor : All right. Understood. Thank you. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. I appreciate it. Let me jump back in. Bunch of things here. First, just deployment of the cash, are you going to get a significant amount of proceeds? [Of course, the field closure could] [ph] generate some cash in 2019 or I should say 2018. And if you think about deploying at the share repurchase is there any way to do that, just given the magnitude of it in an accelerated manner, whether it's an ASR or Dutch or something like that, any contemplation there? Kent Thiry : So, Justin, those are certainly two options available to us as well as open market purchases. We are thinking through our strategy now. It will depend on a whole bunch of factors. And I don't expect that we will be giving a whole lot of color on how we anticipate doing this. It's just something we'll report on after it's done. Justin Lake : Okay. Any of those factors specifically that you - we should be thinking about going into the decision? Kent Thiry : There - look, there are a lot of factors including price, timing, other use of proceeds. But I don't think we have a formula or an algorithm we can guide you to. Justin Lake : Okay. Then you mentioned that $30 million onetime benefit on Medicare recoveries from a timing perspective, right? Is that going to be a benefit of $30 million to OI in 2018? Kent Thiry : Correct. Justin Lake : Okay. And that's a good guy versus what you previously expected. Moving there, obviously you gave a range. So is that the reasonable way to think about it? And is there any other bad guys that we think should be offsetting that or should this move us out to the higher end of the range, all else being equal? Kent Thiry : So this isn't a good guy relative to what we have been talking about before. Given the magnitude a dollar of RPT, it's not something we would necessarily, typically, call out there a bunch of things like this that flow through from a year-to-year basis on any given year. The reason we wanted to call it out this quarter was because it will drive a roughly $3 RPT increase in Q1, because that $30 million will be concentrated largely in the first three or four quarters of the year. So we just wanted to make sure you and everyone else knew it was coming. Justin Lake : Okay. And then, on the provision for doubtful accounts, can you tell us which drove the increase in the number of uninsured patients you're seeing in the quarter? And do you expect this to be the new run rate going into 2018? Kent Thiry : Sure. So that flows through the bad debt line. The other adjustment that I referred to flows through the gross revenue line. And because they offset and because of the new revenue accounting standards going forward, we're no longer going to report that gross number nor the bad debt number. So you'll only see the net number. So it is - I think it is safe to use the net RPT that we delivered in Q4 as a starting point for modeling 2018. Justin Lake : Got it. But you're saying - the two aren't correlated, right? One, they weren't delineated to do with each other, right? One is collection of commercial and the other is an increase in uninsured patients. So there are others what's driving the increase in uninsured patients or am I mistaken it? Kent Thiry : They are not connected. And so far, they're not necessarily driven by similar underlying business dynamics, if that's your question. Justin Lake : Oh, no, I'm just curious what's driving the increase in uninsured patients in the first place. Is that something that just you feel like it's happened that's white noise or do you feel like that's - it sounds like you feel like this is the new run rate, so you're going to collect commercial at a higher rate and you're going to have more uninsured patients going forward as well. Is that right? Kent Thiry : Right, that is our view going forward. I think if you want to think about this bad debt number. It's a few things. It's underinsured, it's uninsured, it's higher patient pay deductible. So I think some of these are broad trends you're seeing within the health insurance industry. That's probably as helpful as I can get. Justin Lake : Okay. And I just got a few other numbers questions here to run through. The advocacy cost, you said there was nothing in for California and Ohio. Is there a number that you can think of that we should be prepared for if you do need to start advocating against the stuff in the back half of the year? Joel Ackerman : No, it's a little early. And of course, there's a lot of play out before now and then. And as you know, these things can heat up or die down. And so, the number could be quite drastically different depending on the scenario. Justin Lake : Okay. And then, lastly on the PATIENTS Act, have you've gotten a CBO score yet on this? Joel Ackerman : No, we have not. Justin Lake : Any idea what's holding that up? I know the government - and there's a lot going on and they're passing stuff day by day erodes [ph]. Is there a reason why given how long has it been out there that we haven't got a CBO score? Joel Ackerman : It really is a couple of reasons that are quite straightforward. First, the CBO prioritizes stuff and with all the major legislative disputes and issues with tax reform, and all the stuff around healthcare, and the summer and the rest, and these people coming up with proposal after proposal after proposal. Everyone one of those sucks all the oxygen out of the room. And when there is not regular order, most of this stuff is typically done in very sort of a hectic, frenetic ways. And then, there's a huge amount of organizational fatigue and a huge queue of proposals. So that's one. The second is that the PATIENTS Act involves some pretty significant numbers and pretty significant complexity. It's really transforming an entire segment that has that potential. And so, it just deserves extra levels of rigor and sort of analyzing all the interdependencies about from both the policy and predicted behavioral point of view. It's not as simple as a lot of other legislation about changing something with a drug or changing something on readmission, reimbursement or whatever else. And so, it requires a lot of iteration. And, I guess, that's the third thing I will say. It's not as if they haven't been working on it or they haven't been communicating. There's been a huge amount of interaction between our congressional champions and the CBO, and between us and our congressional champions. And so, it's getting a huge amount of high quality of attention. It isn't sitting in the closet. Justin Lake : That's great to hear. Just to hear, lastly, and is there any way that this has a cost component to it? Do you think it scores as a cost for the government over whatever period they're look at that, like 10 years? Joel Ackerman : Justin, you've been around a long time also. Predicting what the CBO is going to do is not something that we're foolish enough to do. I mean, yeah, the answer to your question I guess is yes. It's not one can see a scenario where they presume cherry picking and some other stuff and say it would be a cost. We think very much it's going to be a tremendous favor for the system over the relevant timeframe. But we're not the ones doing the ultimate model and they got to protect themselves and tend to lean a little bit conservative. So, yes, they could come out with a cost. No, we don't think they should. But it wouldn't necessarily be low quality shoddy work if they did, because they've got a tough job of predicting all this stuff, so is that helpful? Justin Lake : It is. I appreciate it, Kent, thanks. Kent Thiry : Alrighty. Operator : We show no further questions in queue at this time. [Operator Instructions] Kent Thiry : All right, operator, that's good. Thank you all very much. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Operator : Good evening. My name is Marie, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Marie, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in the company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings release of earlier today and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all on this call. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. Therefore, I will start, as always, with some of our clinical results. CMS recently released the latest five-star results for the kidney care community in April, in fact, and the industry mix of four-and-five-star centers increased from 41% in 2015 to 53% in 2016. It says wonderful things about our community overall in terms of improving care year after year after year. In addition, DaVita's mix increased in the same period from 42% to 56% and we still long for the days of yore when there was a forced curve for these rankings, but very happy with our leadership position with respect to the current system as well. And if we hasten to add and remind people that these improvements in quality of care are not only good for our patients and their families, but they're also great for the taxpayer and that they lead to improved health and reduced hospitalizations. Now onto the three summary points of this call from a pure business point of view. JR will talk about it in more detail, but the quarter, as many of you have no doubt already observed was a strong one for U.S. Kidney Care. Second, the DMG sale process continues to progress on track. And third and finally and equally significantly, we deployed significant amounts of your cash towards share repurchases. I'll come back a little later with another thought or two, but now over to Javier for U.S. Kidney Care. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. The first quarter was a good start to the year with solid operating performance in our Kidney Care business. Aside from changes in calcimimetics, which I will discuss shortly, it was a pretty straightforward quarter operationally. Normalized non-acquired growth was 3.4%. Net revenue per treatment was up slightly excluding the positive impact of calcimimetics and the additional Medicare bad debt revenues of $24 million, open enrollment in commercial and ACA plans were stable, and we had good performance in operational cost and G&A, offset by the increase in our workforce costs and seasonal payroll taxes. Now for some detail on calcimimetics, starting in January of 2018, this class of drug was included in our Medicare reimbursement on a cost-plus basis. This is our first transition of a drug class from Part D to Part B reimbursement. The transition introduced significant operational changes in our clinic, billing and contracting teams. We spent the second half of 2017 developing processes and systems and training teammates for this change. While it is early, I am encouraged with the transition to date. As you know, there are still several open matters, in particular timing of when the generics to be introduced, physicians prescribing patterns between the oral and injectable product, and the future transition of calcimimetics into the bundle. Now, let me transition into union-backed initiatives we are facing. These initiatives attempt to cap reimbursement by ignoring the costs actually required to operate a clinic. They have already led us to cancel and postpone new clinics in California despite the need due to an already high capacity utilization in the state. If the initiatives were to pass, we believe a legal or regulatory intervention will be needed to prevent negative impact on access to care for this vulnerable patient population and could have a broader impact on utilization of hospitals and emergency room resources in the state. To counter these initiatives, the dialysis industry and other healthcare groups are working together and have hired experienced advisers. We're committed to advocate and represent the voice of our patients, our teammates, and our shareholders, and do what is necessary to educate voters on the risks and flaws we see in these initiatives. Finally, I know you're looking for us to handicap the outcome, but at this juncture, it is difficult to predict. I will note, however, that if the ballot initiative fails, unfortunately, it is not likely to end the union's corporate campaign. Now moving on to policies that benefit patients, we continue to be excited about the prospect of transforming patient care in the dialysis industry through the PATIENTS Act. We have an unusual amount of bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress with 178 co-sponsors. While it will be a significant lift to get this transformative legislation approved this year, we believe we have a real shot. During the quarter, we made progress on other important issues to the kidney care community, including legislative provisions that authorize private accreditation for dialysis providers, which could lead us to open new facilities faster in certain states. We also got reauthorization on Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans, including C-SNPs, which have been set to expire January 1, 2019. And lastly, we also have now allowed PD and HHD patients and their physicians to substitute two of the three monthly in-person physician visits with a telehealth visit, which we expect to facilitate growth in the home modality. These are all good steps forward for patients and providers. Now, on to Joel for financial details on our results. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Javier. Operating income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $411 million. The quarter contained a few items that are outside our run rate. First, we recognized $24 million in Medicare bad debt recoveries relating to the change in revenue recognition standards. This is in line with what we mentioned last quarter. In the second quarter, we expect to recognize another $6 million to $8 million. Second, we recognized $17 million related to prior period shared savings revenue from our DaVita Health Solutions business. We do not expect this to recur next quarter. Net dialysis revenue per treatment was up approximately $23 from Q4. Approximately $19 of this came from the calcimimetics change and $3 is from the Medicare bad debt recoveries I mentioned before. Adjusting for these factors, RPT was up about $1 versus Q4. Our dialysis patient care cost per treatment was up approximately $25 from Q4. Most of this was the result of the addition of calcimimetics to our dialysis cost structure. Other smaller items were the headwind for the 401(k) match we implemented this year, increases in salaries and wages, seasonally higher payroll taxes, and one fewer treatment day in the quarter. The overall impact on operating income from the reimbursement change for calcimimetics was roughly breakeven, as a small positive margin in the dialysis and lab segment was offset by indirect costs and operating income declines in our strategic initiatives and corporate segment. Dialysis segment G&A cost per treatment were largely in line with both the first quarter of 2017 and with the full year 2017 average. We continue to expect dialysis segment G&A per treatment to be roughly in line with last year's levels. Looking at the full year, we're continuing to expect our Kidney Care operating income to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. A few words on the DMG sale. We continue to be on track to close the transaction in 2018. As disclosed in March, we and Optum received a second request from the FTC, and we are working diligently to respond. On to international. In the first quarter, our operating profit in international was $1 million, excluding a $3 million foreign exchange loss from the cash balance in our Asia Pacific joint venture. We continue to expect to achieve sustainable profitability by Q4 2018, excluding any foreign exchange gains or losses. This is incorporated in our enterprise guidance for continuing operations for 2018. Regarding taxes, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations was 27% in the quarter. We continue to expect our effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2018 to be between 26.5% and 27.5%. Now, cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $206 million for the quarter. This was lower than our expected full-year 2018 run rate, due primarily to an increase in AR from calcimimetics and seasonal decreases in accrued compensation in the quarter. I will note that our DSOs were down one day quarter-over-quarter in U.S. dialysis and lab segment. We continue to expect operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Now, on to CapEx. First, I wanted to add some detail to our disclosure about our development CapEx. Included in the development CapEx in Table 7 of our press release is capital that we spend for buildings we develop from the ground-up, which we then sell and lease back, as well as the full CapEx amount for clinics that are owned with JV partners. For both these items, a portion of the capital outlay is temporary and eventually covered by either the buyers of the building or our JV partners. To ensure you have the details to take these factors into consideration when evaluating our cash flow, I would point you to a new line we added to Table 7 called sale of self-developed real estate projects, and to the contributions from non-controlling interest line in our cash flow statement. We hope these will help bridge an accounting view of CapEx to more economic view of cash generation of the business. We continue to expect total CapEx for continuing operations to be around $925 million for 2018. This includes some non-recurring capital spend in 2018. We still expect 2019 CapEx to be more in line with 2017 spend of approximately $800 million. Looking forward, we are evaluating opportunities that could lower the capital intensity of our business and are working with physicians, patient groups, payers, and regulators to increase capacity utilization, lower the cost of center construction, and grow home dialysis. If successful, we think these efforts could lead to a stronger ecosystem that works better for all stakeholders. Finally, on share repurchases. Through May 2, 2018, year-to-date, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for $574 million, representing nearly 5% of our shares outstanding. This includes approximately $500 million of stock repurchase since our last earnings call. We view this as an early deployment of the enhanced liquidity we expect following the close of the DMG sale. To facilitate these buybacks, we have taken on higher leverage in the short term and have put in place an incremental Term Loan A as an extension of our current credit agreement. We expect to enter into new financing arrangements subsequent to the close of the pending DMG transaction. Now, I'll turn it over to Kent for some closing remarks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Joel. Before we transition to Q&A, please allow me six quick restatements. Number one and perhaps most important, U.S. dialysis operations are once again strong in every regard. Number two, the DMG sale continues to be on track. Number three, we do have some active swing factors on both sides of the fence, negative things like the union corporate campaign and positive things like the good shot at the PATIENTS Act in integrated care. Number four, we continue to be very well-positioned long term to provide integrated care to the large American kidney disease population. Number five, we're seeing some nice improvement in our international results. And finally, number six, we continue to generate strong cash flows, which we continue to deploy with discretion towards growing our business and towards significant share repurchases. And with that, operator, can we please move to Q&A? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. As of the moment, we have four questions on queue. Let's start with Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. So, on the \u2013 couple clarification questions first, the Medicare bad debt number, I guess as the way to think of the quarter from a normalized basis is it's kind of just take out that $24 million number to kind of see what a clean quarter would be. Is that the way to think about it? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I think that's fair. And I'd also point to the $17 million from the DHS as a non-recurring item. So if you really wanted to normalize, you'd take out both of those. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. But both of those things were already contemplated in the guidance, so that's not a back-out versus the guidance. It's just more kind of back out to a clean base number. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: That's fair. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I guess, I'm trying to figure out how to think about the calcimimetics for the rest of the year. I just had to model it. My guess is the answer is that it's not going to be a big earnings driver no matter how it plays out. But is the assumption that that number should kind of decline over time throughout the year as the company gets better at kind of moving to generics and managing the utilization of that drug, so we should be kind of assuming less of a boost to revenue and also less of a cost (17:20) number be relatively stable to Q1? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I think the beginning, Kevin, is \u2013 where you started out is the right way to think about it, which is in aggregate, it'll be economic neutral to slight positive, and there would be a temporary up if generics come out. So, that's probably the best way to think about it. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. But we should kind of think of a revenue cost effectively it comes down a little bit as the year goes on? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I think, right now, we don't have visibility of that because the best way to think of it is we've had some operational changes in where it goes and what line item. But clinically, we're not seeing any change of yet, so hard to predict what you're asking. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, maybe the last question. It's in the commentary around the CapEx spending and it seemed like for the first time \u2013 I don't know if you guys were ever against home hemo certainly. I think you always viewed it as an important part of the benefit. But it almost sounded like you were planning on doing it a lot more prospectively and that was a maybe initiative that we haven't really seen from you in the past. Has something changed there about your view about the need for \u2013 or the opportunity in home hemo over the next few years versus how you thought about it over the last few years? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I don't know. Kevin, this is KT. We have been a leader in growing PD and HHD for the last decade relative to most of the community, big or small, for profit or not for profit. And so, it's been a significant part of our last decade. It's had an impact on de novo decisions and CapEx decisions, et cetera. And so, we are continuing to consider it as one of the very important variables in making regional strategic decisions. And so, maybe it's a slight change, but it's actually just pretty darn consistent with what we've been doing for a decade, and we're going to maintain the same intensity level going forward as far as to where we are today compared to ten years ago. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Any reaction to the CVS announcement around they're trying to push into home hemo on dialysis? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin, this is Javier. I've gotten the question asked by many people, and the reality is that we don't know exactly what they're going to do since there's not a lot of details out there. As you know, we've had intense competition in the past, and we are working hard and we will do so to compete effectively going forward. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. So just want to go back and make sure I'm crystal clear on the $47 million. So you're saying whatever number you end up with this year in terms of EBIT or operating income, I should take $47 million out of that number as the right jump-off rate to go into 2019? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry, Justin. It's Joel. I apologize. Can you say that again? You're asking about the annual run rate against which you would compare 2019? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, Joel. Basically, what I'm asking here is if you do $1.5 billion in operating income, right, Kidney Care income, I need to back $47 million out of that to think about the right jump-off rate for growth in 2019, because that $47 million is not going to recur next year. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's $41 million. It's $24 million plus $17 million. But I think you're thinking about it correctly that these are non-recurring, not... Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Well, there's going to be another $6 million to $8 million next quarter. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry. Yeah. So that's fair. Yeah. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Just wanted to make double sure I'm clear there. So then in terms of commercial mix, can you give us an update there on any changes in the quarter? And maybe even tell us the impact on revenue per treatment, either sequentially or year-over-year from commercial mix change? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Justin, as you know, we don't guide quarterly on mix. What I can sort of state because it feels so important is that we are in a normal environment, and in the past quarters we tried to give you a little sense of what that meant in our portfolio. And right now we're in a stable period, and that's reflected in our revenue per treatment and in our guidance. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So stable commercial mix? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: There's nothing that I'm \u2013 that I would give you additional detail. How's that? It's embedded in our guidance. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So \u2013 okay. So maybe I can come at it another way, then Kent. I think you talked fairly positively about commercial pricing and contracting coming into 2018. So I just want to try to understand how this squares up to, it looks like about a $1 increase in core revenue per treatment. I know the Medicare rates are almost zip, but I think you get $1 there. So why is the commercial price driving a little bit more of an increase there if mix is stable? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: I'm going to take a stab at it, Justin, although there's a lot of puts and takes, of course, but I think the primary point that we made last quarter or last quarter and the prior quarter was that we had an unusual and positive level of long-term stability baked into five out of the six largest contracts we have. And so it was more about the stability at what we think are reasonable rates. That was a distinction from much of their prior year's history. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And when you talk about reasonable rates, I always have thought about those as more like 2% to 3%. Is that what we're seeing there, kind of inflationary-type rates? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think we want to start giving answers on specific percentage changes, given we're always involved with all sorts of negotiations with all sorts of payers. And again, the point we made, which was a positive one for shareholders, was about the longer-term nature of a lot of the contracts, especially the big contracts, and at rates that we think are reasonable and fair. So those were words we hadn't been able to say for the prior year or two or maybe even three. And so it was good for you all to know that. But we really have never gone quarter-by-quarter or year-by-year talking about weighted average commercial increases, because that then can get in the way of our negotiations. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. I just want to go to the shared savings in the quarter. Maybe could you just remind us a little bit, what participation you have that's driving that? Because I know it added about $14 million in the fourth quarter, and I guess technically you said, don't assume that would recur in the fourth quarter. You didn't necessarily say it may not recur ever. So was this quarter a surprise? But just kind of remind us where you're participating and the scale of that? And why you don't think you might have equivalent earnings from the program next year? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry, Gary. Could you repeat? Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. On the shared savings, earnings contribution, the $17 million you're talking about. In the fourth quarter, you had about $14 million and you suggested we probably shouldn't assume that recur. So it looks like this came in better. Could you just kind of remind us the scale of your participation and why you don't think these types of earnings would continue going forward? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Those were non-recurring settlements with one of our clients. And so they don't reflect any sort of ongoing profit flow. And that's why we used the phrase non-recurring. So that reflects some good business success, but it's not a regular operating result. It was more a negotiated result after the first phase of a big project. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Two more quick ones. I thought Joel said excluding \u2013 I presume this is what he meant \u2013 excluding the calcimimetics impact that dialysis segment revenue per treatment would be in line with last year. Were you speaking to the quarter or were you talking about 2018 overall versus 2017? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: So, Gary, I said it would be up about $1, which is Q1 2018 over Q4 2017. That's backing out calcimimetics as well as the Medicare bad debt recovery. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. You didn't make a comment about the full year of 2018? Maybe I just didn't understand that correctly. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: No, I didn't. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Last question. So you called about $19 of revenue per treatment impact from calcimimetics. Fresenius this morning said $11. Any thoughts on why your number is more sizable than theirs? I know you guys do plenty of market intelligence. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: No. We obviously were told of their number, but we don't have a good reason for the difference. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Clive at Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. A few questions. First, just on the California situation, thank you for the detail on that. We heard from Fresenius earlier today that it sounds like Arizona may not be moving forward. It would be great to just hear your views on where things stand on whether a question gets on the ballot in Arizona and Ohio. And also SEIU has apparently budgeted about $15 million to push the initiative at least in California. I believe Javier mentioned that it wasn't just the dialysis industry joining the fight on this. So I assume that means you'll get sort of financial help from other interested parties, but it would just be helpful to understand the approach here. And second, you mentioned the Dialysis PATIENTS Care Act is getting a lot of attention. Do you have any specific piece of legislation that you have your sights on as a vehicle for this? Do you think there's enough time before election season and campaigning really kicks off? Or will this more likely be a 2019 event? And then just lastly, could you just give us an update on the acute market in U.S. Dialysis? FMC seemed to allude to, I think, losing a contract in acute care. I was just wondering if you've picked up anything in particular there and whether that was part of your fairly strong organic growth in the quarter. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Okay, Lisa. Let's take them in order. The first one on Arizona and Ohio and what's going on with the ballot initiatives. While we hear rumors, there's no real confirmation whether it has dropped out in Arizona and Ohio. So we continue to be optimistic in both states. And as it relates to the size of the investment, of course, we're going to try and get as many people to participate economically, and we will do what it takes to make sure that our patients' and our teammates' voice, shareholders' voice is represented. So too early to tell. As you know, these campaigns can have major fluctuations in the size of the investment depending on how they play out. And so I don't know. Did I get to all the points on the ballot there? Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Yeah. Actually, just one follow-up, there is still no real major costs for fighting these initiatives included in the guidance. Correct? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: That's correct. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. On the last one, and I think I'll let Kent talk about the policy point. Let me just take on the acute. We have worked very hard in our acute business to make sure that we keep pricing discipline and we work hard to stay profitable. We win and obviously sometimes we lose accounts, but the business continues to be a good contributor for us. And this high flu season actually had some give and takes from our center into the hospital, but it is a good business for us. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And on PATIENTS Act, it's just really hard for all the reasons you know to guess what might be available as a vehicle. There's certainly going to be some legislation that passes before January 1, 2019, because they have to do certain things, although sometimes they seem to be able to avoid doing even what they have to do. So I say that without total certainty but certainly very high probability, and we'll be competing with other people for whatever vehicles exist. And whether that's in the second half of 2018 or the first half of 2019 is just pretty difficult to handicap. Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay, thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. One more numbers question in terms of the revenue per treatment. Just want to confirm that the shared savings dollars don't flow through revenue per treatment, that $17 million, right. That flows through ancillary? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Correct. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then getting back to the SEIU and, Javier, I know you said they're coming on multiple avenues, so maybe we could just talk about a couple of the other ones. The SEIU and some plans joined to send a letter to CMS on patient assistance. Curious if there's any feedback from CMS here on their thoughts regarding their willingness to reengage here. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Justin. As it relates to the letter to the Secretary, I would just say that it is normal for the new Secretary to get involved and for some of the people to try to respin-up the story because of their special interest. We, of course, have responded, and the AKF has responded because that letter has a lot of misleading allegations and a lot of things that had been debunked by the community, just factual things that need to be debunked. So in general, we have not heard back from them, but we know that the counter-response that the American Kidney Fund letter has on their website is very, very good and very clear. And so we're happy at the response, and we have not heard whether they're engaged. The other thing that's important to consider is that the numbers speak for themselves. The individual market medical cost attributable to ESRD is just lower now than the group market. And so what that means is that the risk distribution is now in favor of the plan. And so the numbers speak for themselves that there's no there-there. And so I'm hoping that when they look at the facts, they will reach the same conclusion. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. And then just in California, on the legislative side, looked like there was some legislation introduced to, I guess, force the dialysis community or the AKF, I guess, to disclose any patients that are getting charitable assistance. So I want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly, and what you think the potential impact? I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether it passes or not. But if we just assume that it did, what would the potential impact be that you should think we should consider? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: I think, Justin, you're talking about SB 1156, the Senate Bill, which is again a payer and a union with a different agenda and trying to put some kind of restriction on CPA and sort of the typical thing that we've disclosed where the payer is wanting to avoid coverage for the sick, and the union is trying to lever the dialysis industry. So what we're trying to do is obviously, work with the legislation to educate them. And this bill is more extensive than dialysis, not just the AKF. And so we will be working with other constituents to make sure that legislators are educated. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just following up on Gary's question around the run rate, or this $17 million or the run rate on the shared savings, is there a run rate that we could think about as being a reasonable contribution for your participation in these plans that we should think? And maybe it's not $17 million. Or \u2013 but should we assume that they're zero next year? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. I think zero is a safer assumption going forward. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : And given that you're participating in these, are you saying that you don't see yourself participating going forward? Or you don't think there will be any savings to share? Why would it be zero? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: It's a very small startup operation, Justin, with disproportionate expenses relative to its business base. And so there's going to be ups and downs and puts and takes. In the context of the broader enterprise, they're going to be really tiny. And so it just, I think, makes sense to call it a neutral, and then we'll wait and see if at some point it starts to generate numbers that are worthy of your attention. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Got it. In terms of, Joel, you gave us some helpful numbers in understanding what your true economic CapEx was, and I really appreciated that. You mentioned you're evaluating opportunities to lower CapEx. You talked about center construction cost by adding capacity. I assume you mean you're going to increase capacity at existing centers? Meaning almost knock down a wall and put another set of chairs in there, relative to building an entire another center? Decreasing... Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry, Justin. My comment was about increasing capacity utilization, not about increasing capacity. So it actually would not require any marginal CapEx. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So I guess what I was really trying to get to here is just if you saw yourself as being successful there, relative to the $800 million run rate that you talked about for next year, if you hit on all of these things, how much of a dent in CapEx do you think that could make? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: So I appreciate the question. I know exactly where you're coming from. It is just too early for us to speculate on if this initiative will be successful and at what magnitude. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I apologize. I'm rambling off because I think I'm the last person to ask a question here. So I won't get back to jump in the queue. So I got one more for you. In terms of \u2013 it's good to see that you're looking at your stock as an attractive investment. You're buying it ahead of the expected DMG close. So, one, it makes everyone, I assume, think that you feel pretty confident that this deal is going to close despite the regulatory timeline. But as importantly, when this does close, it sounds like it's going to close before we might have clarity on the ballot initiative. Do you see yourself potentially stepping forward and doing something even more material once you have full visibility on the close and have access to that cash while the stock is in this limbo, or do you think that's not something that you could see yourself doing? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Justin, we're not going to speculate on timing and process and methodology for the share buybacks. We're committed to the buybacks as we've talked about in the past. How exactly those will play out is very hard to predict. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there then. Thanks, guys. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We show no further questions on queue. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you all very much for your time, attention and questions. And we'll work hard for you in between now and our next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good evening. My name is Christine, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's second quarter 2018 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Christine, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are : Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainty that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainty, please refer to our first quarter earnings release of earlier today and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all out there on the phone for your interest in DaVita. I'll make three quick points up front. As Javier will review, we had a strong quarters for Kidney Care operations. The second point is the DMG sale process continues to progress and is on track to close this year. And number three is we've deployed significant cash towards share repurchases during the quarter. However, as we are first and foremost a caregiving company, I will start our call, as always, with clinical results. Infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalizations in our population. In the second quarter, we delivered the lowest infection rate since we started tracking these rates. For our in-center patients, the bloodstream infection rate actually decreased by 9% year over year, outpatients even better as the peritonitis improved \u2013 decreased by 19% year over year. This is not only an unambiguous example of quality improvement on the clinical side, it also leads to a dramatic improvement in quality of life and lower costs for the system. And on that happy note, I will turn things over to Javier. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. The second quarter was strong, with solid fundamentals and solid earnings growth in our dialysis business. I'll give you three high-level points on the financials, and then Joe will go into more detail. First, normalized non-acquired growth was flat for the first quarter. Second, revenue per treatment was up slightly after adjusting for Medicare bad debt recoveries in the first and second quarter. Third, we continued to contain our costs despite wage pressure. On today's call, I will focus on five topics. First, as you probably know, the preliminary 2019 Medicare rate was released a few weeks ago. After five years of practically no increase, we are encouraged to be back in an environment where Medicare fee-for-service rates will be growing again and help offset inflationary reality. Second, calcimimetics, the transition from Part D to Part B reimbursement continues to go well. In the second quarter, utilization and economics look similar to the first quarter. Across our Kidney Care business, we expect the net impact of calcimimetics to be a mid-single-digit margin before our indirect costs to administer the drugs. For the third topic, let me provide an update on the human activities and some bad public policies they're seeking to pass. There are three different issues the industry faces and that it opposes : number one, a bill in California that seeks to restrict dialysis patients' access to charitable premium assistance by creating hurdles to patients and charities and limiting the providers' reimbursement for commercial patients to Medicare rates; number two, a ballot measure in California to capture reimbursement from private payers and interferes with our contract to the benefit of private insurance; number three, we will likely face the similar ballot measure in Ohio. In the next two weeks, we will know if the Ohio measures has qualified. The dialysis community is committed to advocating against the measures on behalf of our patients, our teammates, and our shareholders. We are working with a broad coalition of over 100 healthcare providers and patient groups to oppose these measures and intend to do whatever is necessary to educate voters on why these measures are flawed. Unfortunately, educating voters on regulations around a complex and lifesaving therapy such as dialysis will be expensive. On to the fourth topic, GranuFlo, a jury recently handed down a negative verdict involving DaVita's use of GranuFlo, one of the components used to produce dialysis. Before I comment on the case, I want to be clear. DaVita's first priority always has been and will continue to be the care and safety of our patients. DaVita has a clear record of improving patient quality of life and reducing patient mortality over the last two decades. Now on to the case, we do not believe the verdict is supported by the facts or the law. We will be pursuing all avenues to overturn this verdict and do not believe that the verdict will stand in its current form. My fifth and final topic is DaVita Rx. As we talked about in the past, changes in the oral pharmacy space, including reimbursement reductions, have hurt the economics of DaVita Rx. As a result, we are looking for a new way to deliver high-quality pharmacy services to our patients in a more cost-effective manner while maintaining our medication management capabilities. As such, we will be outsourcing the customer service and fulfillment functions of DaVita Rx. We will maintain our renal-related medication management capabilities in-house, which will help us provide differentiated integrated care to dialysis patients. And in 2019 and beyond, what remains of DaVita Rx will be accounted for as part of our U.S. dialysis and lab segment, similarly to how we handle our labs. Let me finish by emphasizing that the underlying dialysis operations and clinical results remain strong. These results allowed us to maintain our adjusted operating income guidance range while absorbing the significant anticipated advocacy costs. Now on to Joel for some financial details and our results. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Javier. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $419 million. This includes $12 million in non-recurring Medicare bad debt recoveries from prior periods relating to the change in revenue recognition standards we implemented at the beginning of 2018. This is slightly above the $6 million to $8 million we expected. As you will recall, in Q1 we recognized $24 million from this change. We do not expect any significant prior-period revenue from this going forward. Excluding this impact, net dialysis revenue per treatment was up approximately $1 from the previous quarter. This was driven by an increase in commercial and government rates, partially offset by a seasonal decline in acute treatment mix. Our continued strategic review of our business portfolio resulted in three changes this quarter, creating some noise in the quarter's financials. First, following up on Javier's comments on DaVita Rx, in the first half of 2018, the Rx business was approximately breakeven before intercompany management fees and excluding an $11 million charge related to write-off of assets in Q2. We expect to incur some additional charges in the remainder of the year related to this plan. These charges are excluded from adjusted operating income and guidance. For the second half of the year, we expect to incur an adjusted loss on DaVita Rx operations of $20 million to $35 million due to duplicative costs during the transition. This loss has been reflected in our adjusted operating income guidance for continuing operations. In 2019 and beyond, we expect no significant net financial impact from DaVita Rx. Second, we sold our remaining stake in Tandigm to Independence Blue Cross. As a result of this sale, we have recognized an after-tax gain of $19 million, which is included in our discontinued operations. Third, we sold Paladina Health in June and recognized a one-time operating income gain of $35 million, which is excluded from our adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income guidance. Regarding the sale of DMG, we continue to be on track to close the transaction in 2018. For international, our adjusted operating income in the quarter was $3 million, which included a $5 million foreign exchange gain from the cash balance in our Asia-Pacific joint venture. We continue to expect to achieve breakeven adjusted operating income in late 2018 excluding any foreign exchange gains or losses. This is incorporated in our enterprise adjusted operating income guidance for 2018. Now cash flow, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $606 million for the quarter. We continue to expect OCF from continuing operations for the year to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We also expect CapEx for continuing operations for the year to be consistent with the approximately $925 million we mentioned previously. Finally on share repurchases, through July 31, 2018, year to date we purchased approximately 15.9 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion, representing nearly 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. This includes approximately $500 million of stock repurchased since our last earnings call. As we said last quarter, we view this as an early deployment of the enhanced liquidity we expect later this year. On July 11, our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization. The total amount of our repurchase authorization remaining as of July 31 was approximately $1.4 billion. For our annual adjusted operating income guidance, we are maintaining the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, but we have now included in this guidance our expected costs associated with countering the union policy efforts. This guidance does imply lower expected operating income in the second half of the year than in the first half. This is the result of two positive items in the first half of the year and two negative items expected in the second half. The positive items are $36 million in Medicare bad debt revenue recognized in the first half due to the implementation of the new revenue accounting standards and $17 million in DaVita Health Solutions revenue recognized in the first quarter that we do not expect to recur. The negative items are the $20 million to $35 million anticipated second half adjusted loss at DaVita Rx, and the increased advocacy costs expected in countering the union policy efforts. We incurred some costs in the first half of the year, but we expect costs in the second half to be significantly higher and heavily weighted in the third quarter. Therefore, the fact that we are maintaining our adjusted operating income guidance range while incorporating this additional cost shows our increasing confidence in the underlying financial performance for 2018. This change to include anticipated advocacy costs in our updated guidance also impacts our expected tax rate because these costs are not tax deductible. For the second quarter, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita Rx from continuing operations was 29.5% in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations to be 28.5% to 29.5%. Now I will turn it over to Kent for some closing remarks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: A quick restatement of a few of the key takeaways; number one, we are experiencing a material amount of non-business external friction, particularly on the union side. Importantly, however, number two, we continue to be strategically well positioned both in the context of the current business model and for the longer term providing integrated care to kidney care patients across the country. And lastly, number three, we continue to generate strong cash flows. And with that, operator, can we go on to Q&A please? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the Q&A session. And our first question in queue is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. I wanted to see about the guidance. Is it fair to say that now that your guidance includes \u2013 you actually didn't say how much the advocacy costs are going to be, but let's say $50 million of additional costs, that you're more comfortable at the low end of the guidance, or are you saying that the core business has improved through the year and you're comfortable at least at the midpoint of that guidance range? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I guess I would say we are comfortable adding the advocacy costs and obviously bringing in a new cost and maintaining the guidance is the positive side. I would not interpret anything about where we expect to be in this guidance range relative to where we had expected to be beforehand based on the fact that the advocacy costs are coming in. Is that responsive? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess. It's basically saying you're not going to comment. So that's fine though. I guess you mentioned the two California bills and the Ohio ballot. When we think about those things, how do you quantify the potential impact if these things were to be going through? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Kevin, we figured you'd ask the question. Unfortunately, the answer is not very satisfying because there are so many variables in play and literally every day there's a new dynamic. As you can imagine, they're all very different. But if the ballot initiative passes in California, you'll instantly have approximately 66,000 patients that are being treated in centers that mostly will be unsustainable. And so to assume that there's going to be some kind of a plan, a backup for that is just unrealistic. So then you've got to go into how would it play out and then you go into, well, okay is there going to be some intervention by policy makers to avoid a crisis and if there are some regulatory things or some legal challenges we could do, and so on and so forth. But the answer to your question is we're not going to give a number. It's too hard to do so. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right, maybe you can help clarify a couple things. I've gotten questions from people about what the California ballot initiative is actually trying to do because the language says the rebates go back to the commercial payers, which some people have interpreted to mean that this 15% margin is actually tied to only commercial payers rather than the 15% margin to the site across all payers on average. Can you just clarify your interpretation of how that margin is applied? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: First of all, we've got to be careful with the phrase 15% margin because the ballot defines 115% of allowable cost, and allowable cost is poorly defined. So there's going to be a lot of debate as to what it's in it and what's not. So to assume that there's 15% margin is probably not realistic there. As it relates to the second part of it, I think it is a rebate to the commercial patient, and that is the commercial plan. Is that the second question you were asking? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It's a rebate to the commercial plan, but that 15% of allowable cost, is that done at the site level across all payers that includes Medicare and Medicaid, or is it only applied to your commercial customers, which would obviously be a different thing? If you had allowable costs on Medicare, that would help. Obviously, you're not making your 15% on Medicare. And therefore, it would increase the overall profits of the facility rather than if you were only to apply that to the commercial side of things. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Right, so it's on all costs to all payers the de facto because Medicare is in essence the low cost in many instances. You really are thinking about the commercial payers. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, okay, that's how we're thinking about it. And then I guess the last question then, on the bill that's being debated in California, how do you think about \u2013 you guys have quantified some impacts before about \u2013 if CP-8 were to go away. How do you think about that I guess, in rough terms? Would that be similar to the gross impact exposure weighted by the California exposure of that, or do you think that it would be the net number you say that there would be offsets and the number is closer to $100 million? The $250 million is more the way to think about California being 20% of that is just order of magnitude on that. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Unfortunately, the math is not straightforward on the numbers that we gave you in the past and this one because if you look at the bill, it could effectively eliminate charitable assistance for dialysis patients because it's got inconsistencies between the bill and the OIG guidance relating to the dialysis charity assistance. So it could literally result in disproportionately hurting low income population. And so then you have to go into how would that population behave, what plan would they pick, what's happening with our competitors, are they having less capacity in their centers? So are patients having to in essence go deeper into their pocketbook because they don't want to be displaced, et cetera? So again, SB 1156 is quite dynamic and keeps changing. And every time it changes it introduces a new twist, but the math is not intuitive at that level that you have. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Actually I lied, one more question. Given these three things, I'm a big fan of you guys buying back stock in advance of DMG closing if you've got good visibility on that closing. But I guess how did you think about buying back stock in front of these three things? I guess any one of these things could be meaningful to the company. So how do you think about valuing the company given those potential risks? And that's it, thanks. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: It's a tough question to answer, Kevin, given the uncertainty that these three things create looking forward, but we stuck to our principles, which were looking at the long-term intrinsic value of the company and using that as well as a number of items to decide the pace at which we want to buy, which is obviously influenced by the DMG closing and our not wanting to have to accumulate rapidly during some artificially high stock price. So you put that all in the mix, and that's where we came out in terms of our buyback for the quarter. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just as we were looking at the RPTs less patient care cost per treatment, I guess a measure of gross profit per treatment, it looks like the margin was down about 300 bps year on year just on that measure. And I'm just curious to understand if there's anything to spike out there and whether there has been any change on the calcimimetics side, either from a reimbursement or margin standpoint versus Q1? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, so a few things. Obviously, you've going to back out all the noise. Two things to point out, one is the 401(k), which was an artificial improvement to 2017. So that would probably be the single biggest thing to call out looking at how to adjust year-over-year margins. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, okay. So I was actually going to ask you about that too. And is that still consistent with the $100 million for the year, and is that ratable exactly? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the second part of the question. Is that? Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: The guidance for the 401(k) headwind was $100 million for the year, if I recall. I'm just trying to check the cadence of that and if it's still similar to where you expected it'd be? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yes, it is, and it's relatively flat across the year. So there's not a lot of quarterly variation in that. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And then just secondly, just on the G&A line, it looked well controlled, at least relative to how we modeled it. Is there anything unusual to break out there, or is that a good run rate to use going forward? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: The best thing to do is to look at it as an annual number, and there's not much to report on that. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, okay. And just lastly for me, I just wanted to clarify the comments on Ohio. It sounded like you said the ballot measure has qualified. Is that the case? It seems like there's news reports out that suggest maybe it is not. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: No, I apologize if that's what you heard. We will find out on August 13, I believe, if it qualifies, so in the next couple weeks. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, okay, so still uncertain. Thank you. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon, good evening. I just want to go back to Kevin's question on the OI guide, obviously very good that you can absorb all these incremental costs. You gave us the DaVita Rx number. Can you give us a ballpark ballot cost estimate, or is that just too competitive and you want to keep that out of the call? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: You're correct, we'd like to keep it out. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you for asking and answering. I like that. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Well, you guys are teaching me, I am trainable. So the second thing \u2013 so it's August 1 and you've still got $100 million wide guidance range. I would think there's more visibility in the business there, so I don't think it's unreasonable to ask. Where do you think within that range, the higher? I know you have a history of doing the higher end. Where within that guidance range do you think you're more likely to fall, probabilistically, of course? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, so I think the reason the range remains so wide is advocacy that is contributing to an uncertainty that remains at this stage in the year. In terms of where in the range, I think we're just comfortable with the range, and we'll let it play out. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Maybe for this quarter, can you tell us where you were? It certainly looked like it was ahead of my estimates and I think consensus in terms of OI. Can you tell us how it looked relative to your internal expectation? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: We don't guide quarterly, and I don't think we're going to comment quarterly on where we came out relative to internal expectations. We're going to stick with guiding for the year. We think that gives you the visibility that we can offer. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, I'll ask one more. Can you tell us why the tax rate is up 200 basis points? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yes, it's the expected non-deductibility of our advocacy costs that we expect to pay in the balance of the year \u2013 or to spend in the balance of the year. Justin, I misspoke in the script. I think I said I was \u2013 I referenced the tax associated with DaVita Rx. That was just a foot fault. I just meant DaVita, in case that wasn't clear. But yes, the 200 basis points is from the advocacy, which is not deductible. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, so the tax rate for next year, as long as there's no advocacy cost, would revert back to your original guidance. So this is a one-time charge? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Depending on how you view advocacy going forward, yes, it not a fundamental change to the tax rate. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, I guess I'll follow up on Kevin's question earlier about buybacks. Clearly, $1.4 billion left under your existing program, if I heard you correctly, in light of what's ahead of you with both the ballot initiative and this SB 1156, what is your appetite now for further purchases ahead of the outcome of those two events? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Frank, we have been comfortable communicating our strategy about buybacks, but we're very reluctant to comment about what we're going to do in any given period. It's not something we want to signal. We don't want to drive the stock up artificially and then feel compelled to buy into that. So we will continue with our buyback strategy, but I don't have any particular color for you in the next quarter or so leading up to be the ballot initiative. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No change in cash flow from ops guidance absorbing those advocacy costs, any changes in your outlook for CapEx in terms of just looking at free cash flow? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: No, still the $925 million number we've given in the past is still a good number. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then final question, just any updates, any thoughts around the patient, any timing there or updated thoughts from a regulatory or a legislative perspective? Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: This is KT. The short answer is it's still the case that we have a real shot. We need the CBO score. And if that comes out at a reasonable level, we have a real shot. We didn't bring it up proactively because we figure many of you are sick of hearing that paragraph. But it's still for us very, very alive, and every week we cross our fingers and hope for the CBO score. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from John Ransom of Raymond James. Your line is now open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. I'm next to a very chatty and loud Southwest gate agent, so sorry for the background noise if there is any, two quick questions for me. As you think about CapEx after this year, have you done any more analysis of the relationship of CapEx and growth? Is there a way you could bracket expectations for next year, or is it too early to do that? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: So for next year, we are comfortable saying that we will head back down to a number that's more closely aligned with our 2017 number, and that our view is that 2018 had a couple of things worth roughly $100 million that were unusual, and those will go away, so, something in the low $800 million. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, so that's roughly \u2013 that's almost 2x your depreciation. Is that just the permanent plateau, no matter what? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Hold on one second. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Why don't you give us a few minutes to reflect on the question and see we can come back in a satisfactory way? John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: It just seems like a big number, but... Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Let me take it. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: The $800 million \u2013 I'm sorry, John. The $800 million is \u2013 I wouldn't call it a new plateau. It's definitely tied to our growth. Remember, most of that is not maintenance CapEx, it's development CapEx. We are thinking about ways to get the number down both through small initiatives around lower cost to build de novos, in lowering our IT spend and stuff like that, as well as some larger ideas that I mentioned briefly on the call last quarter. That said, I don't think we're prepared to guide to any trend on the number ahead of what we've said about 2019. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And secondly, the pharmacy initiative, I know you've called out some losses for the back half of the year. When do you think that transition will be done, and what would be good expectations for the ongoing contribution of the business? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: The transition will be in Q3, maybe it slips a little into Q4, and the economics post that in 2019 will be irrelevant. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So it would go from losing what you're saying to basically breakeven or off the P&L. Is that a way to think about it? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: That's a good way to think about it. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So it's a good guess. So I asked about the pharmacy I think last call or two calls ago, and you guys were pretty adamant that it was a strategic asset that you wanted to keep. So what changed in the last two quarters that made you change your mind? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: It's mainly a revenue change, John. So we've had a couple of contractual changes in a drug that has the potential of being generic for quite some time. It went generic, and it went generic, and the pricing was quite rapid, the decrease in pricing. So the combination of several revenue hits made the decision, while painful, the right one. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thank you, that's all I have. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Good morning, really, good afternoon. Just a question, I know you had said on calcimimetics, it was essentially similar contribution as the first quarter. In the first quarter, you said it was $19 revenue per treatment. Would you be more precise? Is it right on $19, is it different... Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, it's about $19, no material change. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And it looks like there was almost $10 million of equity investment income, a line item that usually is not material, contributing to the operating income. What was driving that figure? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: We are taking a look, Gary. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, I think it was $9.795 million. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: And, Gary, could you even talk a tad louder? Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Oh, yes, I'm sorry. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, Gary, I'll remind you that the APAC joint venture we have is an equity investment, and the foreign exchange swings related to that come through that equity line. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You had called \u2013 I think you said that FX was $5 million, so about half of it. So is it fair to think that line is probably a few million dollars a quarter, but not necessarily $10 million or...? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I think you should expect that to swing around and not contribute in either direction over any sustained period of time. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, just two more quick ones. It looks like ancillary $7 million loss in the 1Q added \u2013 it was a positive $3 million in the 2Q, I don't think that was DaVita Rx yet. So was there something driving that? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry, you're asking about the ancillary line? Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, where you give operating income, I think it was negative $7 million negative in the 1Q and it was plus $3 million this quarter, so about a $10 million sequential good guy? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, there's some noise in that line. I think in Q1 it had the DHS number, which was a $17 million good guy. In Q2, it had the Paladina write up, which was a $35 million good guy. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, might have to follow on that one. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Oh yeah, and Q2 also had the Rx minus $11 million running through that line. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, I might have to follow up because it's better, so I'm not sure I understand all that, but I won't tie up folks. Just last question is, so I follow your math on if you take the first quarter revenue per treatment less the $24 million Medicare bad debt recovery in the 2Q, $352 per treatment less the $12 million Medicare recoveries puts your normalized revenue per treatment up about $1 sequentially from 1Q to 2Q. But you said that increase was related to commercial and government rates, so I just wanted to make sure I understand that. I don't think there would be a lot changing on the government rate side intra-year. It may be some intra-year commercial. I guess generally I'd consider maybe there's just some fluctuation of mix, but I wanted to make sure I was understanding that properly. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, there is some \u2013 within the government line, remember, Medicare fee-for-service is not our only government payer. There's Medicare Advantage. There's Medicaid fee-for-service and managed Medicaid. So as mix shifts between those buckets, you can see some shifts in the RPT. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, that's all I had. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next one is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks, a few more questions. You said the DMG sale process is on track. Is there anything further you can share with us? For instance, what might be left to do here when you met the second request, so we can understand the clock a little bit, anything? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Really not much to add, both parties are working to get it closed in 2018. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, anything on commercial mix in the quarter in terms of up, down, or it continues to be pretty steady? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Nothing to call out, Justin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then on share repo, I just ran some back of the envelope numbers, and you bought back 16 million shares. I think we're pulling up about a little over 200 million shares have traded year to date. So you guys have been responsible for about 7.5% of the volume. I'm just curious if that's \u2013 is that the gating factor to the percentage of volume you can be out there? Is that the gating factor to what you've bought, or is that 7.5% number \u2013 I'm just trying to think about looking ahead and the timing of share purchases going forward, or is that just there's no really rhyme or reason to it and don't use that 7.5% as a proxy? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I would not use that as a proxy for what we can buy. What percentage of the volume we are does affect our thinking at times. But I wouldn't say over the course of the quarter or the year to date, that's been a driving factor in how we think about buybacks. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then lastly, I just want to confirm. When I asked about the tax rate going up 200 basis points, you had indicated that most if not all of that is coming from the lack of deductibility of advocacy costs. Is that correct? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : So that didn't have to do with DaVita Rx or anything else, right? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: No, there are other small things related to the change in the tax law that will flow through that, but it's largely related to advocacy. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Because I think what's going to \u2013 what people are going to do is put two and two together here and basically you can math into how much advocacy costs have to be then to drive a 200 basis point change in your tax rate? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yes, the old rate was a range and the new rate is a range, but I get the math you want to do. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : I'm picking up $75 million, and I only say that because I'm sure everybody is going to do it. Is that a number that you'd want to walk us up or down on? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: We don't want to comment on what we are going to spend. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, that's it for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that's the last question in queue at this time. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: All right, thanks, everyone, for your interest. We'll talk to you again in three months. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Operator : Good evening. My name is Iris and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Iris, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me in the room today are : Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. And also joining us via teleconference are Kent Thiry, our CEO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our third quarter release of earlier today and our SEC filings. Please refer to our third quarter earnings release of earlier today or in SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for your interest in DaVita. I've got four headlines before we let JR and Joel take over. Headline number one of course is the Prop 8 victory, but I'm going to let Javier talk about that primarily, certainly excellent news for all of our stakeholders. Number two, regarding the sale of DMG, we continue to work together with Optum to close the transaction in 2018. However, as most of you will recall, we did execute an amendment earlier this year to extend the termination date in case we do not meet that timeline in light of the ongoing regulatory approval process. Number three of four, the quarter did have some unusual expenses, which Joel and JR will go through in some depth. So they do not get in the way of your ability to evaluate the ongoing strength of the business. And finally, fourth headline is, as you net it all out, it's a solid operating quarter in what has been so far a solid operating year. And then, finally before we go into all the different detail and synthesis, we are first and foremost a clinical caregiving company. That is what comes first and so consistent with our tradition, we'll always talk about a clinical accomplishment at the top of the call. We're going to broaden that slightly going forward to include either a clinical accomplishment or an improved patient experience. And what I'm going to talk about right now is more in the latter category because so far this year-to-date, we've added on a net basis 1,300 more PD patients, peritoneal dialysis that is, people that can take care of the dialysis without coming into our centers. Now this does not always lead to improved clinical outcomes, in many cases those clinical outcomes will stay the same, but for many of these patients, it's a tremendous improvement in their quality of life, because of the scheduling and physical mobility that they pick up and so that's our patient experience story of the day. Javier, please take it over. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Let me jump right in. I will discuss four topics today, Prop 8, calcimimetics, team and an update on guidance for 2018. First on Prop 8. Let me start with the obvious. We are pleased that Prop 8 was defeated. This was the right outcome for our patients, California and the entire system. We thank not only the California voters but also the entire coalition of over 160 members that worked hard to defeat this union-backed ballot initiative. The broad coalition included the California Medical Association, the California Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association of California, the American College of Emergency Room Physicians and California Chamber of Commerce to mention a few. In pursuing Proposition 8, we believe that the SEIU-UHW abuse of ballot initiative process and displays disregard for patients by putting the union's organizing objectives above access to life-sustaining care. Unfortunately, we do not anticipate them stopping their efforts. We expect this to cause us to spend considerable resource opposing these types of initiatives over the next years. While it's difficult to forecast we're assuming an increase in our baseline spend of $30 million per year on general advocacies plus whatever incremental spend is necessary to counter the specific initiative. Now on to calcimimetics. In the third quarter, both revenue per treatment and cost per treatment declined slightly, so is essentially neutral to operating income. We continue to expect the net impact of calcimimetics to be a mid-single-digit margin before our indirect cost to administer the drug. This excludes any short-lived benefit that may come should generics enter the market. Third, I want to pause and take an opportunity to recognize the professionalism and the dedication of our team, whether it's the California campaigns or the recent hurricanes, our caregivers have stayed committed to delivering life-sustaining therapy. We're proud of and inspired by them. Lastly, let me provide guidance for 2018. For our annual adjusted operating income guidance, we're narrowing the range to $1.5 billion to $1.25 billion. This guidance is at the low end of the range we specified last quarter. There are two reasons for this. First is, we spent $20 million more for advocacy, but we feel great about the results. Second is $23 million for a change in our executive, retirement policy which Joel will discuss. We also would like to \u2013 the context of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, that guidance was $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion excluding advocacy, because that was such an unprecedented variable and quite distinct from ongoing operation. So if you want to put the updated guidance into context, you would add $95 million to the updated range yielding a $1.595 billion to $1.62 billion. In other words, we will be at the high end or above the original guidance we provided last year. So no matter how you cut it, it was operationally solid quarter and a solid year-to-date. Now, I'll hand it over to Joel for financial details on our results. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Javier. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $314 million. Let me walk you through the components; first growth, our treatment per day growth of 4% and normalized non-acquired growth of 3.3% continued to be at the low end of our long-term guidance range. On revenue\u00b8 RPT was down $3.75 compared to Q2. Approximately half of the decline is due to the non-recurring Medicare bad debt recoveries from prior periods in the second quarter of 2018. Approximately, 20% was due to a decrease in calcimimetics revenue, which as a reminder had a similar decrease in cost. The remainder is due to other normal puts and takes with revenue. G&A cost increased significantly in the quarter due to two items. First, $45 million in advocacy spend, a $32 million quarter-over-quarter increase. This is in the dialysis and lab segment Q&A (8:45). Second, approximately $23 million non-cash charge for modifying and accelerating existing equity awards due to the adoption of a retirement policy on the treatment of equity awards held by executive officers. This is in the corporate G&A segment. For international, our adjusted operating loss in the quarter was $4 million. We continue to expect to achieve break-even adjusted operating income in Q4 2018, excluding any foreign exchange gains or losses. Now our cash flow, which has remained strong and enduring. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $362 million for the quarter and nearly $1.2 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We also expect CapEx for continuing operations for the year to be consistent with the approximately $925 million we mentioned previously. On to share repurchases. Through September 30, 2018, year-to-date we repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares for approximately $1.15 billion, representing more than 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. This includes approximately $71 million of stock repurchase since our last earnings call. We made no repurchases after the end of the quarter. For the third quarter, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations was 41.4%. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations to be between 30.5% and 31.5%. This is as a result of the increased advocacy spend and the adoption of the executive retirement policy. Now I'll turn it over to Kent for closing remarks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. I'd just like to make a few statements before we move to Q&A. Number one, as we try to avoid redundancy in these calls, but at this stage, I can't resist being a little bit redundant to JR. With respect to the SEIU-UHW, it is one thing to try to organize a union and there's very well-developed and heavily supervised processes for that. It's quite another to demonstrate a stunning disregard for patient care by trying to put an entire industry unsustainably under water. It's really strikingly irresponsible for the patients and also ironically for the teammates that they purport to care about. So we will do our best to represent our teammates and patients well going forward as we did this year. Number two, we continue to be very well-positioned for the general movement towards integrated kidney care and in particular for implementing the PATIENTS Act if we're able to get it through the legislature. You might well ask, with the Democrats taking over the House, how does that affect us? The good news here is that for 15 years DaVita has never strayed too far from the middle, one always spends somewhat more time with the majority party. But we have never skewed that very far because we know these things change over time and in the Senate even despite whoever is in the majority, you really need both sides to get something like this done. And so we've all the way along invested in both the Republican and the Democratic sides of the House and have a strong position there. And in fact Democratic constituencies represent a highly disproportionate percentage of the patients who would massively benefit from the PATIENTS Act. And so in some ways it's an even better philosophical and constituent fit. The third of the four comments I'd like to make before Q&A is just to once again point to the resiliency of our cash flow and our respect and caring for that, we take it quite seriously. Fourth and finally, we will continue to work very hard to get the DMG deal closed and put those proceeds to work for you. Operator, could we please move to questions? Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.: Iris? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Jim, do you have a way of getting that...? Operator : I'm sorry. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have our first question coming from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Let's start off with the third quarter and kind of the results, obviously, a lot of moving parts here. So if I wanted to simplify it a little bit, the guidance is down about $37 million at the midpoint, you had what sounds like two costs that weren't contemplated that total $43 million, so ex those costs, it sounds like you took the guidance up at the midpoint. Is that the right math to think about, number one, and if that's the case, is it fair to say that the underlying run rate of the core business is running ahead of the previous plan for third quarter and in the fourth quarter? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: So Justin, Joel here. Your math is right in terms of where we're running pretty much consistent with what we had expected, bounces around a little bit but no real changes there. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then as we think about the underlying run rate of OI coming out of 2018, again with all these moving parts, how should we think about the right jump off point for 2018 OI going into 2019, once we remove kind of the charges that aren't going to continue into next year? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. So, I guess, I would start with kind of the 2018 guidance we've given you and then you'd really want to normalize for a bunch of things. So there is advocacy, which we've talked about, this retirement policy change, there's the Medicare bad debt which showed up in the first half of the year; and then two other things I'd call out; one is DaVita Rx which we've called out as a headwind in the back half of the year of $20 million to $35 million and the third was a one-time good guide from DHS of $17 million at the beginning of the year which we also called out. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So if I do that math, I still think I'm coming out to about $1.6 billion in run rate OI. Do you agree with that? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: The short answer is yes. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So as we think ... Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: We're limited on what we can kind of say from an FD standpoint \u2013 not from an FD, from an accounting standpoint about adjusted OI. But yes, I agree with your math. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, given I brought up OI for 2019, maybe is there anything you could tell us about how we should think about that $1.6 billion going forward into next year, how we should think about growth relative to maybe the normal growth rate you talk about in the business? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: We're not in a position to give guidance on 2019 right now. We're not going to go there. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Maybe puts and takes, headwinds, tailwinds you want us to think about versus that $1.6 billion. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Not really. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: And Justin, while I've got you on the guidance question, I was given a piece of paper that said that I did not say the right guidance range, you probably picked up on it. The guidance range should be $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion. So my apologies for that. Operator : We have our next question coming from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. I wanted to follow up on that guidance, that's probably the right way to think about it looking at the midpoint of the two, but it does look like a bigger decline on the top end of that range of $75 million, I don't know if you can kind of say that $45 million of its advocacy and the stock comp, I understand most of that decline, but if the core business is kind of coming inline if not slightly better, then why is the top line coming down even more than kind of those two one-time charges? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Joel, why don't you continue. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Kevin, I'm not sure I understood the question. Could you say that again? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, so you took the guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion down \u2013 the high end of the range from $1.6 billion down to $1.525 billion, so you took it down by about $75 million. And there's two discrete items you called out, advocacy was $20 million more than you had last quarter and then your stock comp was $23 million more, that's $43 million right there. But in answer to Justin's question earlier, you kind of said the core business was coming inline if not slightly better than you thought, so why is the high end coming down even more than the range, than that $43 million? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, so look we guide to a range for a reason there. There are fluctuations as you would expect and as we look at those, we're comfortable with coming in at this $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion, I don't think there is anything specific that I would point out. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then with the treatment numbers, it has been really bouncing around the bottom end of that long term 3.5 million to 4.5 million (19:30) range, that you guys talk about, is there anything you know driving that, are you seeing any issues around demand or is this just an issue around opening new de novo sites? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: The short answer is ... Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: JR, do you want to...? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Kent. There is obviously a lot of noise in the volume. We are seeing it in the lower end of the range or below the range. And so there's nothing that we can tell from what we have the data had several years of lag. And there's several dynamics going on with upstream diseases like hypertension, diabetes, what's going on with mortality and transplants. So, unfortunately, I don't have anything that could be useful on that. We're seeing the same things that you are. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But you're not \u2013 you're not expecting to \u2013 you still think 3.5 million to 4.5 million (20:28) is the right range, there is no reason to think that it's now 3 million to 4 million (20:31). Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: We're looking at all the variables and we'll get back to you if we need to change that guidance. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then last question just on the DMG sale, I was a little \u2013 I wasn't sure exactly what was \u2013 what am I to infer from the impairment charge on that business? Is there something along the lines of \u2013 sounds like there is no change to the deal itself, do you still expect the same proceeds, I wasn't quite sure if there was something that we should be reading into, I guess, A, the commentary the deal might drop into 2019 and then B, just that you had to do valuation of that business? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. So the valuation adjustment is the result of our need to evaluate fair value every quarter. And based on our update of the various inputs including the transaction itself, risks, timing, the performance of the business et cetera, we booked this valuation reserve. As far as timing is concerned, look this is a complicated regulatory process but we continue to work hard with Optum to close the transaction in 2018. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But nothing's changed about what you think the net proceeds will be? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: In terms of changes to the deal, the only changes that have been made have been the termination date. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay, operator... Operator : Sorry. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So I just wanted to dig into RPTs for a minute, a couple of specific questions. It didn't sound like you sized calcimimetics on RPTs this quarter, but that it did step down from 2Q where I think it was about $19. Can you share the number for 3Q? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: JR, you want to grab that? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: The decline for the quarter is $0.81. That's the RPT impact from calcimimetics. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Sequentially, so about $0.18 in the quarter. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Roughly, yeah. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just commercial mix and rate, any update there. Did that have any impact on RPTs or is there anything changing inside of that bucket? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Go ahead, JR. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. On RPT, a couple of things. Let me start off by saying we're not seeing anything unusual in our negotiations. Number two, we have seen a slight decline in commercial mix and a small shift toward lower paying plans, and so \u2013 but one would ask the question what can one take into the future, what are the trends, and unfortunately on that one, there is no clear trend, so there's nothing that you can take forward at this juncture. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And any color on kind of the shift in the lower paying plans, is that exchanges or I don't know, how best to think about that as \u2013 any additional context there? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: We don't have any insight into it but yes they're shifting towards exchanges and lower paying plans. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And just lastly kind of related to this line, but maybe a little bit bigger picture, we've been expecting about $7 million of loss revenue kind of recapture from the 3Q 2017 hurricanes and obviously had some exposure. It looks like you probably had some exposure to Florence and maybe a little bit to Michael as well. So any context on whether that $7 million materialized or what the impact of the hurricanes this year may have been on either volumes or expenses or both and how that's affecting the guidance? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. The impact on OI is not significant, I think the net impact on NAG is maybe 10 basis points which is an uptick from Q3 2017, offset by some hurricane impact in this quarter, but nothing significant. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Understood. And maybe just the last one before I jump back, Prop. 8 kind of at this point, it's behind you. Sounds like you're looking at $95 million of advocacy costs for the year and color today suggests there's about $25 million in 2Q, $45 million obviously in 3Q is stated, so is it safe to assume you know you're looking at something around $25 million in Q4? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, it's in the right range. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thank you. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi Good morning. Good morning. Gosh. Good evening actually. Just a few quick ones. Just on the charge related to DMG and part of it was tax related, the $118 million. Will that impact your net cash proceeds from the transaction or this is all just the accounting? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: It won't have an impact on the proceeds. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I want to make sure given all the adjustments I'm correct, it looks like you know if we \u2013 I think it's $1.143 billion of adjusted OI through nine months which would be comparable to your new guidance. So it implies 4Q of $357 million to $382 million do I have that correct? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I'm sorry, Gary. You're running a little quick there. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. I was taking your new guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion on OI and I believe the nine-month adjusted OI number in the press release was $1.143 billion. If I had that correct and comparable. So I think it implies $357 million to $382 million of OI for 4Q? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. That's right. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Which looks like \u2013 it looks like it implies a larger year-over-year decline. The advocacy costs are easing sequentially, but maybe the pharma losses are increasing sequentially is there an obvious answer as to why 4Q would be down more than 3Q? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: I don't \u2013 I'm just stumbling on the math a little here, Gary, and I apologize for that. My recollection was after you adjusted Q3 and Q4, OI are about flat. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Maybe I'm not doing it right. My last question... Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Gary, we're going to do a little math here, while it keeps going and I'll just clarify that for you. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I may have been incorrect. My last question will be for Kent. Given you've talked about the necessity of advocacy ongoing, I guess particularly I'm thinking about the charitable premium assistance issue where it's not just the SEIU that's been involved, but the insurance lobby to some degree believes they have some skin in the game. Is there \u2013 do you think there's a need to sort of readdress this issue with the insurance industry in any way or do you think the right approach is just to advocate in the state legislatures? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, very fair question. First, with respect to the CPA legislation that the SEIU was involved with, there was only one plan that worked with them. Now that's not to say that there aren't a lot of other plans that don't like charitable premium assistance period for dialysis or anything else. But since our patients are so much more identifiable and so much more expensive, it's an easy poster child. So, while it is true that the insurance industry as a group doesn't like it, with respect to that one piece or sort of predatory legislation, there was only one plan that really worked on that pretty much at all which was actually rather interesting. Now moving on to the question beyond establishing the context, I think, it's a fair idea to take another run at trying to sort things out. Historically each time we have and said let's try to work out our own compromise and our own code of conduct that both providers and payers will agree to. We just haven't gotten much take-up, and so I think it's a fair idea. But the most likely outcome is that everybody is going to wait for the regulators decide. And as you know, it's been quite a long period of time now and there's a reason for that, it's pretty complicated and you could hurt a lot of patients pretty quickly. And so folks are appropriately hesitant as they try to sort out the truth. So we're still in that state where they could make a decision of some sort in the next month. They might not make a decision for the next year. And we'll take under consideration this notion of once again trying to see if there can be an industry compromise. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Appreciate it. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Hey, Gary, let me just clarify on your question before on Q4 over Q3. So if you take Q3 add back the advocacy and the retirement in the quarter, you'd come up with an adjusted number. And then if you'd compare that to Q4 and add back advocacy in Q4 as well you'd show Q4 being about $30 million ahead of Q3. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. And is \u2013 I guess, I was \u2013 okay, I'll rework that. Appreciate it. Operator : We have our next question coming from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Just a couple from me. If we look at 2019, and in your commercial contracts, what percent of your commercial revenue is currently contracted? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: We haven't... Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: JR? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, thanks Kent. We haven't disclosed the number, but it is the great majority. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I would like to point out that I'm also JR, just for the record... Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Well, then you answer the question. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well, when I say great majority in cell C3 (32:09) it doesn't spell out anything, but that's fine. The second question is, I know I've been a pest about this, but capital efficiency, how should we think about, is run rate CapEx still in that $700 million to $800 million range and if we've done any more work to try to break the link between the spending and growth? It just seems like I know I'm having an opinion, it seems like an awfully high number of high level spending and I wonder if there's any more efforts to become a bit more capital efficient down the road? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. So no changes to what we've said in the past about capital which is $925 million for the quarter coming down next year. And we anticipate that continuing to happen and looking forward, we are looking for ways both short-term, as well as long-term ways to make the business more capital efficient. That said nothing specific. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Oh! I'm sorry, $925 million for the year, I'm told I've said for the quarter, I apologize. But yeah, we are looking for ways to make the business more capital efficient over the long term, but no specifics to update you on with that. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just some \u2013 I might be the only guy I didn't know this, but to think about next year how much will we pull out in total for the year for pharmacy in terms of avoided losses with your new structure? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. So JR or Joel? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. So, what we've said is in the second half of this year, we would lose $20 million to $35 million for pharmacy. We still are looking at that range, so you'd have to back that out as a tailwind for next year. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Clive from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Great. Thanks. First, just wanted to drill down on your comment on the slight decline in commercial mix in the quarter, your large competitor mentioned that there was a big July enrollment that \u2013 or a bigger July enrollment period than historically and it sounds like they didn't do a particularly good job attracting new private patients and thus lost some share. Could you maybe just comment on normal quarterly fluctuations that you see with private patient mix and whether your trends seems sort of out of whack with those fluctuations and a related question, have you seen more competition from ARA, now that they have a national contract in place with United Health. You obviously don't run into them in that many markets, but I'm just curious about the dynamics where you may have clinics near theirs? And then final question, just on home dialysis. Could you remind us what proportion of your patients are on PD today and what proportion are on HHD. FMC appears to be making quite a big push into HHD. They've increased their HHD patients from 2% to 4% in the past few quarters, and I'm just wondering how much of a priority it is for you at this point to build out a bigger HHD platform? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you for the questions and let me try and take them one at a time. I'll take them in reverse order since that's the way I remember them. On home, we have 11% of our patients on PD and about 2.5% on HHD, so about 13.5% over both modalities. On the second question on ARA, have we seen any change in the competitive landscape, the answer is no to that. And on the third one is there anything in particular that we should call out on the commercial trend? We don't see anything that's worth calling out. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Thanks very much. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks for taking my question, again. So just to follow back up on the commercial mix here. Given it seems I think it's been pretty stable for the last four, six, eight quarters talking about a decline here. Can you give us any more color in terms of the magnitude, what you saw in the quarter, did it get worse through the quarter, any of that? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Justin, on that we're trying to be helpful and obviously know that these words are not comforting. It's slight decline and again our negotiations look the same. Seasonally adjusted Q3 always has a little change because Medicare enrollment opens up and so that's going on. But other than that we had that small shift that I already outlined to lower paying plans. There's really nothing else to call out. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. The run rate, tax rate we should think about going forward as we go into 2019, what is the right number to be putting in our models here? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. So obviously we're not going to give specific guidance here, but I think you can kind of step back to our guidance at the beginning of the year. Think about the increased advocacy spend, which will not all be not tax deductible, but most of it will not be tax deductible and that should help you get to a reasonable estimate. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Could you tell me if the tax rate is higher than what you expected in the year of core, has it gone up or \u2013 and if so why? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: It's at the high end of the range. You know, the tax code was pretty new when we put out that range. A lot of things got clarified over the course of the year and that's really what drove where we wound up in the range. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So core ex the advocacy stuff we should think about the high end of the range is a reasonable kind of starting point? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yes. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, the buy down you bought a bunch of stock in July and then it looks like the buy down slowed down meaningfully versus the first seven months of the year in August and September and that you didn't buy anything in October. So just anything we should think about in terms of the pacing of share repo given that's pretty different than what you did the first seven months? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Our leverage wound up at 4.29, which is way above the range we've historically talked about. We've always been comfortable going above or below the range for various reasons, but we are further above than typically feels comfortable. And I think we've tried to communicate that was kind of a pre-buy in anticipation of the DMG deal getting done, and we're \u2013 I think it's safe to say we're slowing down as we get to that higher end of our comfort around leverage. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So maybe it's fair to say that you kind of take a pause and wait until the DMG deal closes before there is meaningful share repurchase going on here, is that the right read? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Look, there are always things that could impact that, but I think you're in the right general ballpark. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just circling back to the DMG deal, is there anything in particular that you would point to that's lengthening this or complicating it versus a typical deal. I mean, I think we're five-plus months post the second request. Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, as we said, look, the regulatory process is ongoing, it's extensive, it's live and unfortunately, we just can't discuss the details of the process. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So, maybe I'll ask a different question on this. Just \u2013 go ahead. Sorry. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Justin, I'd just add, it has proven to be a more difficult process than we contemplated and perhaps that's obvious given the length of time it's taken. But just to eliminate any ambiguity that has been the case. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : And can you tell us whether the difficulty in the process is coming from the DOJ or is it coming from maybe Optum is not wanting to divest what a lot of people would have expected they would need to divest to close the deal. Is there a resistance of divestitures or? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: We're not comfortable I think sharing any of the details. So, sorry about that, but it's hard to see that thing constructive to the process, and I think everybody's working hard. Everybody, the government, Optum, we are all working hard. And it's just taking every bit of that work and more. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Let me come at it one other way and I'll jump back in the queue. If we get to a point where the DOJ says, this is what you need to close the deal, and let's just say that's a package of divestitures, and United doesn't think that that's reasonable. Is there a possibility here, this goes to \u2013 the FTC sues and we go to court. And if that's the case, what happens if Optum loses, does the deal just break and we go back and run an auction? Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah. Justin, look, we are working hard to get this deal closed in 2018. It is a complex process. And with that, I just don't think we want to speculate about the hypotheticals. We're trying to get this done in 2018. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thanks guys. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : We have our next question coming from ... Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Operator? Operator : I'm sorry \u2013 from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Just one more from me. And I think this is for Kent. I mean, just kind of stepping back from the picky and (43:27) sort of near term stuff, the company appears to be a little bit at odds with the unions and also with the payers. Strategically, what do we think about over time to kind of bring you back in line where everybody around you kind of feels good about the value proposition because it just seems like you guys are fighting, fighting, fighting and is there something that you could think about doing differently to make everybody think that we're all on the same page? I know this is a squishy question, but you guys seem to be a little bit more at odds than some of the other companies that I'm familiar with? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's a very fair question. And let me take a good shot at and feel free to continue probing that, with the payers, I think the visibility of charitable premium assistance, which is not that big a chunk of our profit, the visibility has overshadowed the fact that we're doing lots of great highly aligned work with a lot of payers, including some who have very strong feelings on charitable premium assistance from a policy point of view, but it's not preventing we and they from making big strides on implementing aligned value based care propositions. And so, I think there the visible activity is pretty inconsistent with a lot of the invisible activity in ways that would make you feel much better. And then I would also point out that in Congress, we've probably never been as well-situated and aligned and in a positive spot. And with CMS, I'd say we're in pretty much as good a spot as we've been for much of the last 15 years. And so, the sense which I think I would perhaps have too if I just looked at the newspaper headlines that a bunch of things have trended negative is misleading once you are more on the inside. With respect to the unions, which is the one group where I can't point to any sort of silver lining, it's pretty difficult to have a constructive relationship with a group that starts out day one, doing the things that they have done, it's pretty difficult. And we talked to an awful lot of people who have had dealings with them and emerged quite negative on a whole bunch of levels and for reasons that were consistent with what we experienced, and so that one unfortunately got kicked off in a very zero sum way by them. So, I think it's a very reasonable concern. I think the non-visible data would make you feel a lot better. And with respect to CPA, I would repeat that the person who spoke earlier, I think they were right that it's us taking another run at some sort of reasonable compromise is a good idea. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. I mean, I guess from my perspective, it's surprising that 2018, 2019, we're not further along with you guys having executed some \u2013 let's take care of your 10,000 dialysis patients in these four states for x dollars a patient, we will be on the hook for the quality and the outcomes, you pay us one number. Why has that proven such a \u2013 and I know you're at the mercy of the payers, but why isn't there been more vertical traction with some of these risk-sharing things? It's just not clear to me also looking in why we're still kind of in a fee-for-service world and we're fighting over 2%, 3% or 4% revenue per treatment increases and not any further than we were \u2013 it doesn't look to me any further than we were 10 years ago. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Yeah, I'll go first and then JR may want to add. Number one, we are getting new deals done that have more aligned economics every year. We don't announce each of them because none of them in isolation are significant enough to warrant it. And so the progress has been steady and the quality and quantity of conversations has grown. Why has it moved so slowly, however, is largely because it's \u2013 for a lot of payers, they don't have \u2013 while they have a lot of patients nationally, they're spread all over the country and a lot of plans have grown by acquisition and other ways. And so, their ability to be a good dancing partner to isolate and discretely track all of those patients has been limited. Now that's changing a lot right now. But historically, a lot of them administratively simply couldn't really get there without having to allocate an amount of administrative resources that they were legitimately uncomfortable with. So, that's really the primary reason it's moved so slowly. On the government side you saw that they really wanted to try to get ESCOs to work because they believed in it. And while they were testing ESCOs, they just didn't have much of an appetite for other stuff. Now we're three, four years into that, what's happened is exactly what we said would happen is that the program has not scaled and has plateaued, but we lost four years when the PATIENTS Act was sort of put aside by them for a while because they hoped their idea would work. And so that's just the way it goes sometimes with the government that you get a binary fork in the road and this one cost us a few years. JR, do you want to join in? Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Sure. I'll just add one point, John, and that is that we agree with you and that our DNA is very partner-oriented that we want to be leaning in to take as much responsibility of the patient as possible. We believe that our clinics are the natural place to be because we have essential care for 12 hours with a diverse set of caregivers. That said, back to Kent's dancing partner, the payers have a unique dynamic in dialysis in that they really only have about 1 in 10 patients. And so therefore, they fail to see that we are one of the most, if not the most, efficient caregiving model out there. So if you look at our revenue per treatment weighted average across all of it at $300 and change for four hours of life-sustaining therapy, it is incredibly, incredibly efficient and a gift to the system. But the constraint is because of MSP limits the timeframe on commercial, that puts all kinds of restraints on doing these bundled deals, and if we had normal mix 70-30 like everyone else, it would allow for a lot more of this. And instead the payer wonders how long they're going to have a dialysis patient, and we get a little of the sort of the noise around the fact that our patients are chronic and therefore expensive. So those are some of the dynamics, but to your point, our DNA is all around partnering and trying to put a solution to this. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Those were great answers. I really appreciate the expansive commentary. Thanks so much. Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We have another question coming from Lisa Clive from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Great. Thanks. Just two follow-ups; one on the PATIENTS Act, how many supporters are you losing with the new Congress coming in. I'm just trying to understand how much ground may need to be covered a second time if this doesn't pass by yearend, and instead becomes a 2019 initiative? And then interestingly for your further comments just about the private payers and the fact that they only have the patients for 33 months, what do you think the chances are for an MSP extension, obviously there was a small three month went in the opioid build, but then Congress decided they didn't actually need to fund it so it got pulled out. But it was interesting that that should have made it back onto the table seemingly without much involvement from the dialysis industry. I'm just curious as to whether that could focus payers on integrated care in a more substantial way? Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: LeAnne, you want to take the first one or both? LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.: I can do either. I'll take the first one. As it relates to the PATIENTS Act, we are still very well positioned in the house, all four of our sponsors are returning and they are well-positioned with their leadership. So although we have a new Congress you have to build support from the broad base. We think this policy will continue to have the merits it did and it will continue to have the leadership it has. So we feel good about building the same kind of support that we have to go into the next Congress. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: And perhaps LeAnne \u2013 Lisa if you want to call tomorrow or something we can provide the exact number of sponsors that may have lost, but given we're up at about 195 with an almost perfect half D and half R split in that we did retain the leaders, and we do have relationships with some of the senior house folks. You'll see that the net answer is supported by the numbers that we're still in very good shape. Although the bad news is that there's always just a lot of things going on and a lot of noise in the system when there's a change in power because they've got a pent-up agenda, so that's bad. On the other hand, the other side of that sword, the other edge of that sword is that they typically are absolutely hyper to get some stuff done, and that's good for us because we are such a bipartisan idea that's sitting on the shelf. So you can kind of argue that one either way. Then on MSP, the way we look at it, is we were thrilled that we've kept that one in play enough so that it made it into the house version of the opioid bill. Unfortunately the Senate bill didn't need any savings, didn't need any pay fors, and so it lost the tailwind and the impetus that comes from that. So the right way to interpret what happened there is that, it's good news that it still has a place on the shelf and a lot of people know about it, that it's sound policy that actually generates savings. At the same time, we never say that we're optimistic that it's going to happen anytime soon because we know that business and private insurance companies always oppose it. So it's never going to be a lay-up. Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Thanks for that. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Thank you, Lisa. Operator : There are no questions in queue at this time. Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest in DaVita, and we will work hard for you for the next three months until we talk again. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Colene and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you Colene and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today in the room are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer, and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent Thiry : Thank you, Jim. As you probably already noted, we had solid fourth quarter results that were consistent with prior communications and of course J.R. and Joel will discuss those in greater detail a little bit downstream. But we are first and foremost a caregiving company and so as usual we will start by talking about a clinical highlight today, Antibiotic Stewardship.  As many of you know, dialysis patients are highly prone to infections. We have continued to get better at supporting evidenced based prescribing of antibiotics, which has a couple of benefits, including reducing harm to patients from excessive antibiotic use and also preventing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This is something that all caregivers should be doing across American and Global Health Care and we are proud that we are getting better. In fact in 2018, among patients with symptoms of Blood Stream Infections, we actually decreased IV antibiotics starts by 12% while maintaining all clinical quality. This is important not only in terms of what we did this year, but we continue to collect data to improve our ability to do even better in the future.  Now, a quick update on the DMG transaction. We are working closely with Optum to obtain FTC approval, which of course is necessary. The timing of the process was very negatively impacted by the government shutdown as it was for so many other transactions and we cannot speak definitively to the timing for all the reasons we haven't been able to do that up to this point and all the same reasons that other companies involved in other transactions cannot. But everybody's working very diligently to move that ball forward. In addition, some good news is that in 2019 the DMG Financial performance will improve \u2013 is expected to improve significantly. There are a number of very tangible reasons for this. One for example is significantly better Medicare advantage rates than in prior years; number two, the elimination of the health insurer fees, a dollar for dollar significant pick up; number three, the dollar for dollar elimination of considerable consulting expenses incurred in 2018 that will be gone in 2019; and fourth, the number of operating improvements, investments that we made in prior years that are bearing fruit. So the net is that 2019 DMG would be significantly better as is expected to be significantly better than 2018.  Now over to Javier for a summary of our Kidney Care business. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Kent and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll cover two topics. First, I'll provide a recap of our financial performance, and second, I will discuss the legislation recently introduced in California.  For the fourth quarter 2018 our results are in line with our guidance. Adjusted operating income was $370 million for the quarter and $1.513 billion for the full year. Our 2018 operating cash flow from continuing operations also came in line with guidance at $1.48 billion.  Related to cash flows, our 2018 CapEx spend came in better than our guidance and we are guiding to a lower spent in 2019. There are several drivers to this declining CapEx spend, two of which are worth calling out as they should decrease the CapEx spend on new centers in the next couple of years.  First, we continue to focus on driving the right modality for our patient. For many of them dialyzing at home may be the best option. Now that we have a more secure supply on PD products, we anticipate more patients will be able to choose home dialysis. In fact, in 2018 we trained and educated over 13,000 new home patients. As you know, home growth has an incremental benefit of being more capital efficient.  Second, as we mentioned earlier this year, some recent data suggests that ESRD industry growth may be slowing, but we don\u2019t know whether this is a short term impact of increased transplantation availability or whether there is a long term implication in the immediate term we plan to build fewer centers to keep pace with patient demand.  Next, as many of you know Q4 includes open enrollment decisions for many of our patients. Overall we observe stable results from open enrollment, which is consistent with our expectations. In the individual markets in particular, we saw slightly higher reenrollment than we experienced over the last couple of years. We believe that these results set us up to deliver on 2019 guidance we shared last month, which Joel will cover later.  Now, let me transition to a legislative update in California. A member of the assembly has reintroduced effectively the same legislation at last year's SB 1156, which was vetoed by the Governor because of the potential harm to patients. This new bill, AB 290, seeks to impose rate cuts on dialysis providers for their support of premium assistance charities and impose restrictions on charitable premium assistance for patients with pre-existing conditions and end-stage renal disease. Our coalition of dialysis patients, physicians and caregivers in California will of course fight to defeat this conceived bill.  Finally, let me finish by saying that we continue to build our integrated care capabilities, which are helping us care for patients in a more holistic way. Let me provide a couple of examples; first, we developed a predictive model that incorporates lab data, dialysis, treatment data and claims data to determine which patients are at the highest risk of hospitalization over the following month. Second, we now have a team of nurse practitioners dedicated to addressing a broad range of primary care needs on a more real time basis for our patients. We believe that these capabilities will improve the quality of life of our patients, while reducing costs to the system, and of course we look forward to providing this coordinated care to many more patients in the future.  So in summary, overall solid quarter and we continue to focus on delivering high quality care for our patients. Now, on to Joel for financial details on our results. Joel Ackerman : Thanks Javier. Let me walk you through some components of our U.S. Dialysis and Lab Segment. First, growth; our treatment per day growth in Q4 was 3.1% and normalized non acquired growth was 2.6% as we continue to see a decline in volume growth. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to range between 2.5% and 3.5% in 2019.  Next on revenue; revenue per treatment was down $0.65 from Q3 to Q4. If you exclude the impact of calcimimetics, revenue was up a little more than $1 per treatment sequentially. To give some perspective on this for the full year, commercial RPT for the year was down approximately 1% as we shifted out of network business to in network, which offset commercial rate increases that we've achieved across much of the portfolio.  For the year commercial mix was down approximately 10 basis points from 10.5% in 2017 to 10.4% in 2018. We believe that our decline in mix was consistent with the demographic headwind that we have previously outlined.  Finally on revenue, our strategic initiative revenue was negatively impacted by our previously announced wind down of DaVita Rx. DaVita Rx revenue was down approximately $100 million quarter-over-quarter and Q4 is reflective of the go-forward run rate. On costs, patient care cost per treatment was up $1.26 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional fees. Dialysis and Lab Segment G&A was down quarter-over-quarter approximately $4 per treatment, $2 driven by a decrease in advocacy spend and the remainder due to normal quarterly spending fluctuations.  For international, we achieved a slightly positive adjusted operating profit for the quarter, excluding the FX impact of our joint venture in Asia. We expect positive operating income from international operations in 2019, excluding any FX impacts, which are incorporated in our enterprise guidance. For the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations was 24.3% and for the year it was 29.2%. The effective tax rate was unusually low for Q4 as a result of the positive quarterly true-ups for our federal, state and international accruals. It\u2019s unusual that all of these moved in the same direction in one quarter.  Now on to cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $307 million for the quarter and $1.48 billion for the year, in line with our previous guidance. I'll conclude by reiterating our 2019 guidance. We expect operating income to be between $1.54 billion and $1.64 billion. As a reminder, the first quarter had seasonally low operating income as the quarter is shorter with 76.6 treatment days, meaning lower treatment volumes and fewer treatments over which to absorb the fixed costs. Also Q1 has higher seasonal payroll tax.  Our 2019 guidance includes the following expectations; 3% to 4% U.S. total treatment volume growth. 0% to 1% U.S. revenue per treatment growth and 0.5% to 1.5% U.S. cost per treatment growth.  We are initiating 2019 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year to be $1.375 billion to $1.575 billion. In 2019 we expect $800 million to $840 million in CapEx from continuing operations. This range includes CapEx for self-developed real-estate projects that are offset by proceeds from the subsequent sale leaseback transactions. We expect approximately $100 million of proceeds from self-developed projects in 2019 leading to net spend of approximately $720 million at the midpoint.  For comparison purposes, in 2018 our CapEx from continuing operations was $902 million and we received proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of $45 million for a net of $857 million. You can see the historical detail in section six of our supplemental financial data in our earnings release.  Finally, we expect our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations to be 28.5% to 29.5%. As always, our guidance captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, although there are scenarios in which we could end up above or below the estimates provided. Now I'll turn it over to Kent for some closing remarks. Kent Thiry : I like to just make a few comments for : Number one, please be reminded that the next few years Medicare year-over-year fee for service rate increases will be better than the almost zero increases over the last few years.  Second, the international business now has a foundation on which we can expect year-over-year or like contributions rather than offsets.  Number three, we continue to generate strong cash flows and they are fact incrementally better than some of the prior years. And four, we are very well positioned to be a differentiated high value added provider integrated care for these needy and expensive patients.  Operator, lets switch to Q&A please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I guess we want to start of with DMG as a question. I appreciate if you can\u2019t say exactly when it\u2019s going to close, but I didn\u2019t see your comment review that you are still confident that it\u2019s going to close. Just want to make sure that from your perspective everything is still on track and it's just a matter of timing at this point. Kent Thiry : Yeah. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. And then I wanted to talk a little more about the slowdown in growth that you are seeing and expecting from a treatment perspective. I missed, I think you mentioned something about factors that may or may not be temporary. Can you talk a little bit about what those factors are and if there is anything else that you are thinking about or thinking about what organic growth should look like? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, thanks Kevin. This is Javier. We started to see a bit of a slow down on new starts in the back end of the year and that's why when we provided guidance, you saw the number came down to 2.5 to 3.5 of non-acquired growth. Some of the factors that are still in play are what's happening upstream with other comorbid conditions and how that is impacting, how many patients have ESRD, and another dynamic is how many organs are gone into that transplant pool, as the number of organs has picked up due to the opioid crisis with many people being young and having healthy kidneys. So there is a lot inter played, many dynamic upstream and so we are trying to see if they are short term or if they are going to be longer term. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, from your perspective, the new starts that you are doing over the next year, is that going to position you for inline industry growth, market share gains, market share loses, how are you thinking about that? Javier Rodriguez : I\u2019m sorry, are you asking how we are positioned within that growth? Is that the question? Kevin Fischbeck : Yeah, your guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, does that mean that you expect to gain share or are you going along with what you think the market overall should be growing. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, in the last couple of years, actually not the last couple of years, maybe the last couple of decades we've outperformed a non-acquired growth. We believe that there's nothing in the data that would say that we would not do that and so right now we are just looking more at the market dynamics overall. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, and then maybe a last question for now. On the commercial mix, I think you said that you know mix was down 10 basis points year-over-year in line with kind of what you would expect in all demographic trends to kind of argue for. But I think your guidance assumes that actually mix will be relatively flat. So I\u2019m not sure if the demographics point to a decline each year, how you're thinking about being flat you know in 2019? Joel Ackerman : So Kevin, its Joel here. The demographics are certainly a headwind, about 10 basis points a year. We see opportunities to offset the headwind through upstream, education of patients, as well as helping them with their insurance once they\u2019ve come on dialysis. So we see opportunities to offset the headwind, but we do see the headwind persisting. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, alright great. Thank you. Kent Thiry : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from that Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. First, let me follow up on Kevin's question around the deal close. I understand the government shut down and delayed everything, but the last thing you had talked about was expecting the deal to close in the first quarter.  So with the government shut down about 30 days, you know that would take us out to end of April. Is that still kind of where you would expect or do you feel like the first quarter, even ex the government shutdown, you know things have changed? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, so Kevin its Joel here. We are certainly still trying for Q1, that is a real possibility, but the government shutdown has certainly lowered the odds of that happening. Justin Lake : Is there anything new besides the shutdown that would change that trajectory? Kent Thiry : Justin, there is always a lot going on and [Audio Gap] nothing new would suggest that nobody's doing any work, nobody's asking any questions. But Joel\u2019s answer still applies, were we are hired with a goal that he cited. Justin Lake : No problem. And then on the California legislation, just given this is the second time they are coming here and they've got a Governor that you know might be more likely to actually sign this legislation if it gets past. Curious if you can help us, you know put a range around the potential financial impact that we should think about for 2020 if this legislation does pass. Kent Thiry : Yeah Justin, as you can imagine the legislation moves and there's different ways to interpret and of course you can never predict how it'll play out, but to try and be constructive and give you a range, I think it would be useful to have somewhere in that $25 million to $40 million as a range. Justin Lake : That is helpful. I will jump back in the queue. Thanks guys. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Steve Tanal : Thank you guys, good morning. I guess just on the slower normalized, non-acquire treatment growth in the quarter at 2.6, is any of that attributable to pick-up in home dialysis or is that capturing that? Kent Thiry : That is captured in there; the home growth is in the 2.6. Steve Tanal : Got it, okay. And how are you thinking about home hemo. It\u2019s just a comment of sort of growing in the home and making that more available. Is that \u2013 that\u2019s sort of the new technology in the market. Are you guys planning for growth in that business or how should we think about that? Kent Thiry : We\u2019ve been leading in home for as long as I can remember and we will continue to do what's appropriate for the patient and the right modality for each patient, so we of course assess technologies. There is a lot of talk of innovation, but if you really look carefully there's a lot of smoke in that innovation. It really is a lot of the same, and people are just trying to talk up their products. But we of course love it when there's something that's good for the patients and we will pursue whatever is best for them. Steve Tanal : Okay, got it. Then just on the slower De Novos, can you give us a sense for what you are planning for \u201919 and how you are thinking about sort of the number of opening of longer term at this point. Kent Thiry : Sure. So I\u2019ll preface the answer by highlighting the fact that there is a lag between the slowing of growth and the slowing of the De Novos. De Novos that are coming on now are decisions that were made, they are leases that were signed a year or two ago. So with that said, we are looking at a significant slowdown in De Novos in 2019 and we think that will continue going forward. I\u2019ll highlight that it's a function of two things. One, it\u2019s a function of the slowing NAG; it's also a function of the growing home. And you know as more and more patients are dialyzing at home, our need for the traditional in-center dialysis, De Novos, comes down. Steve Tanal : Understood, okay, got it. And then just lastly from me, just on the RPT side in calcimimetics, I think you had mentioned it was a $1 sort of headwind sequentially. Is that sort of calcimimetics in total added about $17. I think it was $18 in Q3 if I recall correctly? Kent Thiry : Yeah, that's about right. Steve Tanal : Got it, okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Steve. And our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. Two questions, first one of the review per treatment. You talked about bringing more revenues from outer network to in network. We sort of estimated about 3.4% of revenues now, out network for your book of business. Is that in the ballpark or can you talk about that? Kent Thiry : I think that question has been asked for many years and I think we are not going to change our stance today to give more clarity on that. We try to be as useful as we could in January to provide some of the trends over the long haul and Kent talked about sort of a nine year trajectory of that number coming down, and I think that's as much as we can do right now. Pito Chickering : Right, fair enough. And then on the weaker growth in the quarter, can you sort of talk about any impact from wildfires or weather and then because it\u2019s sort of varied so much in fourth quarter versus what we saw through the rest of the year, is there any way of getting us any sort of monthly numbers, just so we can get a better feel for sort of what was the core growth rate and also the way you guys exited January. Kent Thiry : Yeah, so nothing to point out relating to wildfires or any sort of one time stuff like that. In terms of monthly numbers, I don't think we are going to go to that level of granularity. Pito Chickering : Okay, fair enough. And then last question from a leverage perspective. As the DMG business hopefully gets sold, I think by the next three years, what\u2019s the right leverage ratio we should think about you guys running? Kent Thiry : No real change to our thinking around that. 3 to 3.5 times is the range we expect to generally be in, although we have gone above that for a variety of reasons. Obviously we are well above that right now. But I think the 3 to 3.5 times is still the range to think about. Pito Chickering : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Healy with Barclays. Your line is now open. Patrick Healy : Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned in the past that as an industry you\u2019d be looking to introduce some proactive legislation in California. Can you just provide some color on what that legislation might look to do? Kent Thiry : Yes, thank you Patrick. Of course, we are trying to make sure that we educate the legislators to understand all the dynamics that are going on in an ecosystem that is not something that they normally are discussing. And so in our legislation what we want to make sure is that whatever guardrails are needed so that everybody understands that the right patient that have continuity of care are getting access to charitable premium assistance, and so it's clarity on that is what we are trying to do as opposed to the bill now, which goes beyond that. Patrick Healy : Got it, and the other thing is Kent I've heard you speak recently about desire to get more involved with the pre-dialysis CKD population. Any color on what kind of investment you may look to make there? Why you think there is opportunity for DaVita and just something that could better enable you to provide integrated care once patients are you know transitioning on to dialysis and you know better address the cost of the patients outside the clinic. Just any color around that would be helpful? Thanks. Kent Thiry : We will be able to add significant, really impressive clinical and economic value if we're allowed to move upstream and help take care of people who have kidney disease, but have not yet experienced kidney failure.  And by intervening with those patients, in different ways we\u2019ll be able to delay the onset of dialysis and in some cases prevent it, and then not only delaying it, but also having people be healthier and have a healthier start to their dialysis. All of these improvements have big clinical and economic implications, but there's a bunch of regulatory work to be done, as well as contracting work to get there, and we are making some nice incremental progress, nothing to bake into any forecast yet, but we're working hard. Patrick Healy : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ransom, Raymond James. Your lien is now open. John Ransom : Hi, good morning, I went back and looked at some of the qualitative comments about commercial contracting all of last year and it seems like we ended up in a place in 2019 that was a bit below at least what I was expecting. So was the thought that you would always end up here or did we get some kind of late breaking news that caused the needle to move. Kent Thiry : John, obviously I don't know what\u2019s in your assumptions, but it came in line with what we were seeing and of course on any given time there's pluses and minuses. But for the year it was in line with what we expected. John Ransom : I was just simply talking about the five to six large contracts being redone and you are pleased with the increases and I guess I was thinking zero to one wouldn't be what should be shooting for, but that's what I was referring to. Okay, that's it for me. Thank you. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Gary Taylor of J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Gary Taylor : Hey, good morning, just a few quick ones. For 2019, is the expected advocacy spend still in the $30 million range? Kent Thiry : Gary, that is the additional spend from our regular advocacy spend, yes. Gary Taylor : Okay, that compares to the 93 extra last year, right? Kent Thiry : Correct. Gary Taylor : And then I just want to make sure I understood in response to Justin's question on the California legislation, the equivalent of 1156. So you are saying if every CPA patient in California moved to the Medicare rate, it would be a $25 million to $40 million revenue in OI hits or there is some offset between revenue and OI? Kent Thiry : I\u2019m glad you are asking it Gary, because basically we didn't provide much detail because there are so many assumptions that go into it around a lot of dynamics and so what we are trying to do is just be useful and give you the top line, which is basically there is a range of $25 million to $40 million, but we are not going into specific dynamics. Gary Taylor : And that would be every CPA patient going to Medicare, right? Kent Thiry : Like I said, patience and the way the system will work is yet to be seen. So it\u2019s probably not good to assume anything, rather be constructive and give you the range of all of the dynamics going in there. Gary Taylor : Okay, last one is for CapEx can you tell us and I apologize if it is on that last page, but CapEx for new centers in 2018 and what you think that looks like for 2019 and in 2020. Just if you talked about your new center openings, I was trying to get a sense of the impact on annual CapEx there. Kent Thiry : Gary, so we can't give you a specific number. There's a range built into that as we watch over the course of the year exactly how many De Novos get built, where they get built, what the cost per De Novo is. But it is safe to assume part of that significant decline from 2018 to 2019 will be the result of fewer De Novos getting built.  But let me jump in and just correct something I said before. There was a question about calcimimetics RPT and I think what I confirmed was a number of $17 just to be clear. $17 was the number for the year, the number in Q4 was about $16 of RPT. Gary Taylor : That's it for me. Thank you. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Thanks Gary. Operator : And our next question comes from Whit Mayo, UBS. Your line is now open. Q - Whit Mayo :  Hey, thanks. On the commercial book, how much of your contract or how much of your book is set to reset in 2019. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of you know what your expectation is for renewals in 2019 and what the expectation is for revenue for treatment. Thanks. A - Kent Thiry : Thanks Whit. We don't disclose how many contracts are up on any given year and so I can't give you that. What we guided to at JPM was that the commercial book would be down 1% to up 0.5%. Q - Whit Mayo :  For 2019? Kent Thiry : Correct. Q - Whit Mayo :  Okay, looking at the deceleration in treatment growth, I know that we are all you know speculating and guessing on a lot of the contributing factors, whether it\u2019s better insurance management transplants or whatever. But have you been able to size maybe internally what do you think some of these contributing headwinds are, just to maybe help frame up for us how to get from Point A to Point B? A - Joel Ackerman : Yeah Whit, so we spend a lot of time on that. It's challenging because the data bounces around and a lot of the data we are using comes on a really long lag. So how to assess kind of current numbers is more challenging than we like. So I don't think we can be particularly helpful in trying to break down how this \u2013 how the deceleration comes about from the different components. Q - Whit Mayo :  I think we're all trying to do the same exercise. Looking at G&A in the fourth quarter, if we exclude the $30 million of advocacy costs in California, it would have been around $180 million and I know that there are quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, but it still stands up a little bit lower than I would have expected and I guess I'm just trying to think about the starting point into 2019. Is this the new run rate? You know just any color to put the G&A trend for this year into perspective. Kent Thiry : Yeah, it is \u2013 it does bounce around as you pointed out. I don't think there's anything major that we would call out for Q4 or in the year-over-year numbers, so roughly flattish would be a reasonable expectation for 2019, and that's on a per treatment basis. Q - Whit Mayo :  On a per treatment? Maybe two other quick ones and I don't know if you\u2019ve disclosed this metric before, but any idea how much of your total treatment mix is Medicare advantage today or you know maybe another way to get a more responsive answer is like I think CMS is five, the industry around 20% of total treatments. Any reason that you\u2019d be you know different one way or the other and I guess I'm trying to sort of gain some insight into 2021 and maybe where you think that that mix can go over time? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, thank you. We have not disclosed our MA mix and we're not going to disclose our MA mix, but as you try and look out at what happens into the future, it's difficult to predict, because as you can imagine individual\u2019s will make their own decisions. But maybe one reasonable assumption could be that it's in line with the overall market, which is around 35%.  But as you know, individual decisions, there's going to be a consideration on co-pays and deductibles and out of pocket and coordination of care. They are going to try and see if physicians are in their network, etcetera. So to try and guess that on a total population is hard, so we of course have done some modeling and right now a reasonable assumption is it'll be in line with the overall market. Q - Whit Mayo :  Okay, thank you and just one last one. Joel, you decided to increase professional fees. Any more color there? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Really nothing interesting there. Some legal stuff is probably the biggest component of that, but really it\u2019s just kind of normal fluctuations up and down. Q - Whit Mayo :  And that\u2019s in \u2013 is your professional fees, is that flowing through G&A? Kent Thiry : No. Q - Whit Mayo :  It\u2019s in your \u2013 it\u2019s in the cost number, patient care. Kent Thiry : Well, it\u2019s in both. I think my recollection, and I'll get an answer for you in a second is that most of the swing up is in the patient care side. Q - Whit Mayo :  Okay. So nothing in the ancillary segment that would be allocated? Kent Thiry : No. Q - Whit Mayo :  Okay, thanks guys. Kent Thiry : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Gate for Gates Capital. Your line is now open. Jeff Gate : Yeah, I'm looking at the U.S. dialysis segment margins and if I exclude the so called incremental advocacy costs and if I exclude the calcimimetics \u2013 however you pronounce it, revenue, and then if I moved $25 million per quarter out of 2017 numbers. If I added back because of the, we\u2019re moving the 401 K benefit, I'm showing that underlying comparable U.S. dialysis margin was actually up for the year and I just wanted to confirm that that math was approximately correct. Kent Thiry : Yeah, I'd suggest we kind of take this offline. I'd be happy to walk it through with you. I'm not 100% following your math. So why don't you reach out to Jim Gustafson and we\u2019ll follow-up on this. Jeff Gate : Okay. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks for taking another question, I just got a few more here. Commercial price, so just trying to come at this another way, you said 60% of the outlier water rates have normalized over nine years. Maybe you could tell us how much more normalization you are kind of assuming for 2019. Kind of where would we end this year at? Kent Thiry : Alright, Justin I just think talking about it year by year, it is just not reflective of reality, which is why we gave you the long term data. We pledged many years ago to work down the outlier part of the book in a constructive way and in some cases that can be easy-peasy. You got a payer that\u2019s got some really high rates and some really low rates and so you move everything to the middle on sort of a net neutrality basis.  In other cases it's not so simple, but that's what we said at the historical data is, so that people know that over a period of many years it has not lead to any material disruption, although there have been give good quarters and bad quarters and good years and bad years, and it's quite unpredictable. And so once again we give you the empirical data, so you can see that it is relatively predictable over the long term, but not over the short term.  So guessing and giving you a guess on a single year, we just think could be really a lot more noise than data. We do however are commit to our belief that over the next five, six, seven years, this trend towards fewer outliers will continue and there'll be some bumps that are positive and some bumps that are negative along the way, but it shouldn't be anything fundamental. Justin Lake : Right. I guess you know I'm sure you can understand, investors are trying to figure out the potential impact and you know this year there was \u2013 you know you have zero kind of built in for commercial rate growth give or take. So you know given you normally get increases in contractors as you said, we\u2019re just trying to figure out like is this a nor \u2013 is this what we should consider a normal year over the next five to six that you talked about or is this a you know a bigger year of these outlier rates moving to normal. Kent Thiry : Yeah, I don't think we can say. We put a lot of work into giving the guidance for this year, we're going to put a lot of work into providing the three year outlook at our upcoming capital markets in 2019, but I\u2019m just spontaneously trying to figure out where in that the word normal applies to that particular number in the particular year of 2019. I don't think I want to say \u2013 we don't want to say either yes or no to what exactly is normal. Hopefully we really helped you understand that.  Clearly there's some offsets in \u201819 that are offsetting the fact that in a lot of our books we're getting nice rate increases. So that is going on and we've done our best job at calibrating it for you, but I wouldn't want to characterize it as either normal or abnormal. If you look over the next, the last eight, nine years, it\u2019s not an outlier, it's just a tough year. Justin Lake : Okay, and then just switching over to volume, you know obviously you've got a ton of medical directors who are nephrologists and I assume they are seeing upstream, their pre-ESRD patients, and so I'm curious what they are telling you in terms of this slowdown in you know patient growth. Are they saying that you know people are taking longer to you know \u2013 if they are able to prevent the kidneys from fully failing, so that's why it\u2019s slowing or are they seeing an actual slowdown in growth in pre-ESRD. I would have assumed that would be something that you would be able to you know see coming from a pretty long distance. Kent Thiry : It's a fair question and as you know there's a wide distribution of sophistication of the way that the practices are ran from very small practices to large practices. With the people that I'm talking to Justin, they have not seen their CKD practice slowdown in any significant way, but one can never put too much stake in that, because the reality is that many of these practitioners are not that sophisticated that their practice is busy and they don't segment, as well as a sort of a Fortune 500 would. But at the end of the day there's nothing that they are picking out. A - Joel Ackerman : And Justin, it\u2019s worth throwing out a few numbers to help explain why JR\u2019s answer is the appropriate one. You just take a typical mythology group and say there's three doctors and say they've got 100 dialysis patients each, that\u2019s 300, and then there's a 13% mortality rate let's say. So that's 39 patients to replace the ones that passed away. And then you have 3% growth and so you add another nine patients on, and so you\u2019re talking about 48 new patients per year spread across three doctors.  When you have a 1% change in the organic population, you are talking about two patients difference over the course of an entire year and settle up whether or not a group has 48 new patients or whatever number spread across 12 months or 50 or 46, that is not something a practice can notice, because year-by-year they are going to have those fluctuations. It\u2019s not going to have anything to do with the aggregate CKD incidence or advancement and so that's why JR\u2019s answer to the practice wouldn't pick up on this, unless it was way, way, way more than 1%.  For us in aggregate and for you we pay a lot of attention to 1%, because there's some incremental EPS math attached to it, but it's highly, highly incremental and not discernible at the practice level with rare exceptions. Justin Lake : Okay. Just a few other numbers questions here. You mention international as getting to profitability. Can you give us any kind of trajectory there, maybe a margin kind of target over the next few years that we think, you know you think would be a reasonable range to think about where this business can operate. Kent Thiry : Yeah Justin, we're not going to \u2013 we're no longer going to call out specific guidance for international. We will continue to report on it every quarter, but given the magnitude in the context of the whole company, we don't think guiding on it as a specific number is something we're going to do. Joel Ackerman : But we will add just to try to be a little responsive without going into misleading details there. We've had three consecutive years of improving the EBITDA margin by 2% per year. So just to give you a sense of the incremental operating improvements and mix improvements, so things are moving in the right direction, we can say that right now. Justin Lake : Okay, but no even target margins? A - Kent Thiry : I don't think that would be a good idea right now given the different country mix. It\u2019s heavily influenced by which countries grow the most and sometimes you might have a lower margin country, but in fact it's got higher return on capital and so it \u2013 I don't think \u2013 it wouldn't yet be a useful number for you Justin. Justin Lake : Okay, and then two more here. The CapEx, you know that\u2019s before where your CapEx can go and Joel you said CapEx couldn't you know materially decline over you know some period of your time if your De Novo\u2019s moderate. Can you give us an idea of what kind of you know \u2013 you know if you had to look today and obviously this takes years to kind of play out because of how far you have to plan them ahead, but two or three years from now, given the growth you are seeing in the business, what kind of CapEx moderation do you think can happen here from that net you know seven and change number that you are reporting for this year. Joel Ackerman : It's hard to predict Justin. We're just not in a position right now to give kind of multiyear guidance on this. It will depend on a bunch of things, including growth and depending on what happened to the growth, whether this decline is temporary or not, as well as what happens to home penetration and other things. There can be some real impact on that number, but we are not in a position to give longer term guide. Justin Lake : No, I apologize, but I thought you said it was material. You know it could be a material decline if the growth continues and you continue moving towards home, which it sounds like you are trying to, so I\u2019m just trying to get some order of magnitude. I understand if it were to re-accelerate you\u2019d have to spend more money. But just at this growth rate, in both of those factors, where do you \u2013 you know what would you call material? Kent Thiry : Yeah, we're not in a position to quantify what exactly that would mean right now. Justin Lake : Okay, last one on Medicare advantage. I know to which question you \u2013 it was helpful to say that you \u2013 that you think you can get to an industry average over time in Medicare advantage penetration. But obviously the starting point is pretty important and I just recollect you guys having said 10% to 15%. That was kind of the range of where you were today. Am I wrong in picking that number up? A - Kent Thiry : We're looking around the table Justin and no one remembers ever having shared that number, which is not to say it didn't happen, but there's just a bunch of blank stares across the table. Justin Lake : Okay well, then I'll come out with a different way. You know obviously we\u2019ve talked about this being a potential meaningful positive. To get in getting the 35%, 40% where the industry is going to be a few years from now, it obviously could be significant, but not understanding where the starting point is. There's no way to say whether that\u2019s even going to be a benefit or not, unless we understand the starting point. Is there any way you can give us you know even a round number, 10%, 20%, 30% of where you are today? A - Kent Thiry : Yeah, hey Justin, I want to predict this, because we weren't prepared to do that for today but you are making a fair point. So this is obviously a multiyear issue and we do expect our MA to grow in a non-trivial way and it's going to be great for patients and we think great for the system, because it will also bring down total cost. But none of that is responsive to the specific starting point question. So if you just let us not make a spontaneous decision here, instead think about it and then maybe next quarter we'll provide that number. Justin Lake : I appreciate it. Thanks for all the questions. A - Kent Thiry : Yeah, thanks Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Ransom : Hi, let me just go back one more time on something. So you mentioned wanting to get more involved in pre-CSRD and it would involve some contracting. Is it you know the commercial payer has only been on the hook for 18 months and then Medicare being kind of slow. Are we talking probably the Medicare advantage payers would be most receptive to do some different type of contracting that would actually incentivize you to keep people from crashing into dialysis or nothing about that long? Kent Thiry : No, you are thinking about it correctly. You were already doing that work with some payers and both they and we believe were having quite an impact clinically and economically and so we would expect that to increase over time. However, right now there's not math associated with it that's exciting enough for you to bake it into any near term forecast. Hopefully the future rolls on and we get better and better at it and have more data to prove how good we are at it, it'll be more relevant to your model. John Ransom : And is this part of the tuition from DMG or does this accelerate your learning curve in some of these risk based types of contracts. Kent Thiry : Yes, there was some very good learning in both directions where DaVita Kidney Care was able to help DaVita medical group do better on kidney care patients, both dialysis and pre-dialysis and similarly DMG was able to help DaVita kidney care do better at managing down the total cost, and managing the economics of our dialysis patients. So it was a good, mutual, and it continues to be a good, mutual learning highway. John Ransom : The other question I had is our D.C. BC folks think that CMMI might do some different payment structures for home dialysis. So two questions; one, are you hearing any of that, number one; and then number two. Let's just waive a wand for example and say three years from now you've got a set of 12% of your patients, let's say it's 25%. How do you think about that at a high level from a return on capital or contribution margin total economic today across. Thanks. A - Kent Thiry : Yeah, I'll take a stab at it. Number one, CMMI is looking at a bunch of kidney care stuff, including eliminating some of the obstacles to home and PD growth and we are supporters of that and we're on regular constructive conversations with them about the best way to do it. We've had a series of meetings. We've also talked with other people and so we applaud a bunch of the stuff that they are looking at, and hope that they go ahead and put it in. I think there's a good chance that they will.  And then second, if you waive that wand, that is a good world in a couple of different ways. One, it just significantly reduces the capital intensity of our business. Number two, there are some patients in America who would be happier or healthier on home that are not on it today, because of local practice patterns, nephrology group preferences, etcetera, and we've been growing homes steadily.  Javier referred to the fact that we've been the leader for a long time in this and intend to remain the leader, but that doesn't mean that every single patient that should be on home or might be happier at home, is on it now. And so implication number one is that a step outside of capital intensity excuse me would be happier and in some cases healthier patients.  Having said all of that, that right now when people walk around saying that home is almost uniformly a better form of care for dialysis patients, it\u2019s factually incorrect and so for a lot of patients it leads to a better life. For a subset of patients it leads to better clinical outcomes, but not for everyone and what you tend to have is that the type of people who take the initiative and have the desire to dialyze at home are a fundamentally different type of patient on average than those who stay in the center.  So it's very, very difficult to do an apples-to-apples clinical comparison, because of the type of population you have that is willing to take on the burden and responsibility and risk of dialyzing at home. John Ransom : So thanks for that and last one for me. Just at a very high level for home, how much of the relatively minor mix in your opinion is qualitative factors around physician practice patterns versus quantitative and clinical factors? A - Kent Thiry : Could you say the question again please? John Ransom : Probably not, but I'll try. So what we have been told is that some of the shortfall and the growth has been kind of tiny, 20, 30 bips a year. What we've been told is that some of that is just physicians, not being trained physicians, not being in the rhythm of thinking about home and just the default answer is the clinic. You know whereas others, you know some patients don't belong at home as you mentioned.  So if you had to guess \u2013 if we normalize physician practice patterns across the country and everybody was thinking about it like this is the first option, look to the patient, how much we can, where can the mix go to just with the qualitative physician decision making versus some of the other factors you know around the famous structures and you know clinical offsets. Javier Rodriguez : John, this is Javier. I think when we look around and we see the most, let's call it home champions, the most dedicated physicians that have a good education program and are really trying to champion the right modality for the right patient, you get into a low you know 20 or so mix. Maybe you get it up to 25 if they are really, really good, but that's on the high end and as you look around the world, that\u2019s probably also a good number to use. John Ransom : Thanks, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s all from me. Kent Thiry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Hey, just a few more from me. I guess I might have missed it, but did you say that the guidance for 2019 includes additional advocacy costs or is that included in the normal run rate spend? Kent Thiry : No, it includes this $30 million which is consistent with what we\u2019ve said before and think of it as you know $60-ish million less than the $90 million something that we had in 2018. The point I think Javier was trying to make is that we\u2019ve always had advocacy costs built into our cost structure. It went up significantly in 2018 as a result of the California stop. So this $30 million is kind of the remnant of that California piece that will roll through. There is other stuff that\u2019s always been in there and that that hasn\u2019t changed. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great, and then some on home health commentary, obviously home health that you guys have talked about from time to time and have been supportive off it. But this is just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, this feels a little bit more of a discussion that I\u2019m used to hearing from you guys.  Is there anything, so obviously lower cap on density is good; it\u2019s good for some subset of the patients. So that\u2019s good, probably better for commercial patients, so that\u2019s good, but is there anything that you have to worry about as you move the home hemo, because one of the things that structurally I would think that you and Fresenius have.  There is some varied entry and that you guys already have you know bricks and mortar across the country to the extent that we create and push towards a less capital intensive model probably speaking. Does that create the potential for disruption or more competition that you were \u2013 so (a) am I off base on that concern and (b) is there any downside that you can think of as now that is towards home hemo getting bigger. Kent Thiry : Yeah, so one of the most important things to remember is that our patients are big consumers of the entire healthcare system and by definition when your kidneys fail, you are fragile and you\u2019re quite sick. And so one of the things that\u2019s not discussed when discussing home is that the peritoneal cavity (a) there is an high infection and two that sometimes it doesn\u2019t last and sometimes it\u2019s probably not the right world.  Most times it actually gives within two years or so and so if you were to look at a patient of ours, they are (a) hospitalized; home patients that are hospitalized and of course DaVita and Fresenius serve in the acute setting and then number (2) is approximately 85% of patients that treat at home will have to use an in-center at some point in their care. And so having the entire suite meaning the hospital, the clinic, and the home service is a very important part of the value proposition for a patient, because they want the continuity of care, they want their doctor to go from the hospital to the center to the clinic and then of course home. So is that responsive to your answer. Kevin Fischbeck : Yeah, no, that\u2019s good, that\u2019s \u2013 the bricks and motors always going to have an important role even if home hemo becomes a bit bigger than what it is now.  And then, the other question I wanted to understand a bit more about the sale leaseback dynamic. Are you signaling that you plan on owning you rights as a percentage going forward through these sale lease backs or is this more just a method of financing that disruption and that you wouldn\u2019t expect to be leasing a higher percentage of your facilities going forward. Kent Thiry : So Kevin, there is no real change in the amount of real-estate we are planning on owning, which is extremely low. What the dynamic here is that we have found rather than having someone else build the center for us and us leasing it, it is more cost effective for us both in terms of the capital and the ultimate lease expense for us to build the center and then sell the already constructed center.  So the impact on our cash flow is that we are \u2013 we have an increase in CapEx as a result of this which flows through the normal CapEx line. There is a net benefit which doesn\u2019t flow through the CapEx line, but is effectively, economically an offset to our CapEx when we sell this, when we sell the center.  So no real change in how the ultimate ownership of the center, but it does create a little noise on our cash flow that we wanted to really clarify and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve added over the last few quarters how this plays out in table six, what the net kind of bring back against the CapEx is. We understand it\u2019s a little bit confusing, but we thought it was important to lay it out to make sure everyone has the clearest view of what the real CapEx and cash flow of the businesses is. Kevin Fischbeck : Alright, great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Whit Mayo, UBS. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo : Thanks. I just had a couple quick ones on those numbers kind of moving around versus my notes. So just want to make sure I\u2019ve got the correct headwinds and tailwinds written down. On the tailwind side for this year, I\u2019ve got DaVita Rx losses reversing to be a $25 million tailwind. I think Joel you cited now a net $60 million tailwind in California on advocacy and then maybe a $35 million pickup on Medicare rates. Are those the big buckets? Are those the right numbers, are we missing anything? Joel Ackerman : I think the sizes are about right, the Medicare is actually a headwind. I\u2019m getting puzzled here what was you\u2019re\u2026 Whit Mayo : I guess I was thinking more just on the rate update. Kent Thiry : Oh on the rate update, yes. I thought you were talking about the Medicare bad debt issue which is going to bring positive revenue. Whit Mayo : Yeah okay, is that in the ballpark, you know $35 million just incremental tailwind from the rate update. Kent Thiry : That\u2019s about right. Whit Mayo : Okay and then on the headwinds as you mentioned that you\u2019ve got a $36 million headwind from the Medicare bad debt recoveries and may be a $17 million reversal from DaVita Healthy Solutions. Any other major headwinds and are those the right numbers? Joel Ackerman : Those are about right. DHS I wouldn\u2019t call it a reversal in an accounting standpoint. It was a -.it\u2019s the lack of, yes. Whit Mayo : Okay. And so that implies\u2026 Kent Thiry : The one other thing I would point to was the retirement cost that we had in Q3. The number was roughly $25 million, $23 million precisely. Whit Mayo : Got it. Okay. Kent Thiry : Add that to the tailwind category. Whit Mayo : Yes. Got it, okay. And then one last one, just the calcimimetics landscape is like fairly fluid right now, some drugs coming on/off at the market. Just what\u2019s the expectation for 2019 and I\u2019ll get off, thanks? Kent Thiry : Yes. So I think you\u2019re exactly right. It is a very fluid situation. It is one of the largest components of the swing in our $100 million of OI guidance given the different ways it could play out. But roughly speaking kind of if you think about the middle of the range it\u2019s not a big change year-over-year, but again a lot of variability in terms of how it plays out. Whit Mayo : So, what would be the scenarios that would play out that would get you toward the low end versus the high end? Is there any way to share what would have to happen with calcimimetics to be within that range? Javier Rodriguez : The couple of dynamics that you have to consider are one, prescription patterns. In there you have the oral come down or go up or do physicians prefer IV or oral, so there is a mix in there. In addition then you have to consider whether more generics come in t0 market.  So if it\u2019s one player versus five players and what happens to pricing and so then of course you have a calculation on ASP that has got a lag, and has got a six-month lag in that. So those are the dynamics in play. Whit Mayo : Okay. I lied, one last one just on ASP. Can you comment how ASP has trended the last six to 12 months, and what that implies for the next six months, and I promise I\u2019m off now. Joel Ackerman : ASP has trended down. And then as it relates to prediction, you can\u2019t have one because of all the things I just went through. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor, J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Gary Taylor : See what happens when you move your call to the morning. Nobody knows how to get off the phone. Everybody is double dipping.  I just had a quick one. I just want to go back to, while I had you, kind of this question about slower growth in the industry, and looking at the U.S. RDF data maybe there\u2019s a good reason why it\u2019s not good or comprehensive. But if you look at prevalent population growth before 2000 it was in the fives, from 2010 it was in the fours, since 2010 it\u2019s been in the threes. You know it\u2019s a couple of years lag, but it looks like it is poised to drop into the two\u2019s.  So when you look at kind of that bigger picture, the industry maturing, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re seeing something that looks more step function-ish than sort of that that long decline we\u2019ve seen over the last 30 years? Kent Thiry : No. I would say the opposite probably is that the data is quite clear that nothing dramatic happens quickly, and yet the trend is the trend and we\u2019re not predicting any significant change in either direction of the trend. But recognize that there is an awful lot of dynamism underneath that number.  On the one hand treatment for diabetes and hypertension, some of the primary causes of kidney failure are getting better. So you could argue that that would lead to a reduction in dialysis patients. On the other hand the African-American and Hispanic populations are growing significantly in America, and they are far more likely to have kidney disease and kidney failure. So that pushes exactly the opposite direction and I could cite two or three or four other variables. So under the surface of that long-term trend, which we think may very well continue without any significant discontinuity up or down, but underneath that are a lot of basic fundamental forces in American healthcare and American demographics and so it\u2019s very difficult to get too confident, because if any of those underlying trends change, that would in fact create some sort of discontinuity in the trend. It just hasn\u2019t for the past 25 years. Gary Taylor : Got you. I just thought the opioids transplant commentary was perhaps suggesting you thought you were seeing something more onerous or steeper. So I appreciate the clarification. Thanks. Kent Thiry : Let\u2019s stay on that for one second, because that is a perfect example of a new discontinuity, but we would also predict probably relatively temporary one and that we would say that five years from now the incidence of opioid abuse and people getting to the point where their kidneys fail because of the lack of treatment is going to be reduced dramatically, because already the leading indicators for that things like prescription patterns, prescription limitations, prescription oversight, clinic availability to help these people, all of that is fundamentally changing throughout America and is quite well-funded in many cases. So that\u2019s a classic example of a new thing that has had a negative impact in some ways on us in the short term, but will probably on a relative basis become an incrementally positive one over the next five, six, seven, eight years. But it\u2019s once again very difficult to quantify and calibrate, because it has do with fundamental demographic issues and fundamental healthcare system issues. Gary Taylor : Understood! Thank you. Kent Thiry : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, thanks, and thanks for taking all these, you know extra questions here. I want to take another crack at the organic treatment growth that you guys are \u2013 I mean where you guys have guided to versus what you did in the fourth quarter. Are they 2.6% in the fourth quarter guidance of 2.5% to 3.5 % for 2019?  So the new point of guidance is implying an upside versus what is it you\u2019re supporting and in fact they are calling the fourth quarter as the bottom of what the ranges can be. Can you give any additional color in terms of so why this has improved to the midpoint of your guidance for \u201819? Joel Ackerman : I\u2019ll take a crack at that, although I don\u2019t think I got much to add. The number does bounce around a bit, and we tend to look at things, you know some thing\u2019s purely on a quarterly basis; other with a little bit of blending over time. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re blending the Q4 data point with some prior data and our go-forward model, so we come up with something that\u2019s in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. Pito Chickering : Alright, it is worth a try. Thanks so much. Operator : And speakers, we show no further questions at this time. Kent Thiry : Alright, thank you all very much for your interest in DaVita. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  Mr. Gustafson, you may begin. Jim Gustafson : Thank you. Darren and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today in the room are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. Please note that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer. Kent Thiry : Thank you and greetings to all of you. And thank you for your interest in DaVita. The first quarter results as many of you've already seen were slightly ahead of our expectations. Javier and Joel will elaborate on that but as we are first and foremost a care given company, I'll start as we always have with the clinical highlights. In this case, readmissions, hospital readmissions of course remain the top priority. The normal 30-day hospitalization readmit rate via 30 patients is about 35% that's more than double for the normal patient population in Medicare. Our Q1 readmit rate was 31.8% so significantly lower also continuing to improve versus the prior quarter and prior year. And our readmit rate is steadily trended down since we launched a number of transitions of care initiatives really but pretty much starting in 2017, which focused on delivering the right care to patients when they are discharged. If you do the math just to get a sense of the impact on the overall system and the savings and quality improvements associated there with, that improvement of the last two years equates alone to about 45,000 fewer patient days in the hospital. Good for patients; good for taxpayers, good for their families and we're all they going to get better. Moving on this is just shy my 20 year anniversary here at DaVita. I think it's my 102nd earnings call, when I combine that with my time at Vivra where some of you were with me/us there as well. It's nice to finish in a call we're going to reaffirm our annual guidance. And I was told the other day by one of the capital markets players that we have in fact hit our annual guidance and every one of the 20 years, Javier and I together. It is also a good thing about this call that I'm turning over the ranks to Javier whom some of you know and all of you will soon know. We work together as friends and partners for over 20 years. It's been my heir apparent for several years, but this was a board directed process really according to all contemporary best demonstrated practices. But it's nice that both the board and I feel like we're leaving you in very, very good hands. A quick DMG update. There are really three positive things to say about DMG before I turn things over to JR figuratively, as well as substantively. But the three positive points on DMG, number one, we do have a clear path to obtaining FTC approval, which is the exact same perspective that was shared by United quite recently. Good fact number two is that since those statements, there have been a number of recent developments that have moved us along that path, and I was feeling even more positive. And then third, DMG itself has had a solid flash strong operating performance in the first quarter. The rest of the year looks even stronger, making the close all the more attractive to United. Now over to JR. Javier Rodriguez :  Thank you Kent, and good afternoon, everyone. I am humbled and I am excited about the opportunity to serve as CEO of DaVita where I have been for 22 years. I look forward to giving you all detailed view on my plans for the company at our Capital Markets Day which we are in the process of finalizing and scheduling for August or September. That said; let me reassure you that I do not expect any major changes in our strategic direction. So let me reaffirm six elements of that. First, we're a caring company and our focus on clinical excellence will remain at the core of everything we do. Second, we will use our strong platform of over 2.900 clinics including 1,400 home programs and 900 hospitals of hospital relationships and a network of over 5,000 nephrologists to help provides continuity of care for the patient as they transition between the sites of care. Third, we will continue to pursue integrated care with the intensity that is deserved. Four, we will plan a robust set of patient data and innovative analytic tools that will help improve patient care, while lowering overall cost. Fifth, we will continue to build our unique DaVita culture. And finally, we will continue to be disciplined with our capital. Now let me transition to first quarter results. First, our adjusted operating income for the kidney care business is off to a good start for the year, generating $382 million for the first quarter. As you've seen our results, we're experiencing slower trends in unit growth than we expected a few months ago. There are many variables that contribute to the non acquired growth and they're difficult to individually quantify. That said; let me call out a couple of those factors. One, the growth of transplant volumes continued in the first quarter, is talked about in the past about the opioid crisis driving much of this. Is that what will happen in the future? It is hard to say. It is tragic there is an increase in the deaths due to the opioid crisis yet it is a gift for our patients with kidney disease who benefit from the organ donors. Two, we have seen an increase in competitive activity. For example, in the back half of 2018 there was a pickup a number of competitive de novo. Despite the slowdown in volume, we are reaffirming our guidance for both adjusted operating income and cash flow from the year. Regarding calcimimetic, you may recall that we mentioned that this would be one of the biggest string factors in our adjusted operating income for the year. We expect that things will remain quite dynamic as a number of generic entrance and pricing remains fluid, making it hard to predict the full-year financial impact. Before I turn it over to Joe, let me make a few comments on policy. Over the last few months, HHS secretary, Azar has articulated four priorities to focus the department's work. One of which is transform the healthcare system from one that pays for procedures and sickness to one that pays for outcomes and health. Starting with some bold proposals in primary care and given the comments he's made about the dialysis industry, we are optimistic about the opportunities to transform the kidney care sector. Overall, we support his vision to slow the incidence and progression of kidney speeds, broaden the availability and uptick of home dialysis and transplantation and support the continuity evolution and adoption of value-based care delivery models. We have advocated for these policies and have implemented innovative programs towards each of these objectives over the years. We are philosophically aligned and are eager to learn more about the specific. Now on to Joe to provide some additional details on the quarter. Joel Ackerman : Thank you Javier. First, I will walk you through some components of our US dialysis and lab segment. Non acquired growth for the quarter was 2.4%, absent a turnaround in future quarters in the underlying metrics Javier referenced; we expect to come in below our non acquired guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. Revenue per treatment for the quarter was in line with our guidance, and was up sequentially by $0.40. Before I move on to cost per treatment, I did want to address a question that came up last quarter about our Medicare Advantage mix. For context, the MA mix for all dialysis patients with Medicare as disclosed in the most recent US RDF data was 21% in 2016. In 2016, our percent of MA in Medicare was in line with the rest of the dialysis industry. As you would expect that number has grown for us and we assumed for the industry as well given the secular shift to MA in the broader marketplace. In Q1 of 2019, our MA mix stood at 24% of Medicare patients. We expect this number to continue to grow roughly in proportion to the MA market growth before the 21st century Cures Act in 2021. Patient costs were down a $1.52 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower drug costs, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs and seasonally higher payroll taxes. Dialysis and lab segment G&A was down quarter-over-quarter $0.86 per treatment as a roughly $3.00 per treatment decrease in advocacy spend was largely offset by higher compensation and benefit expense. Now some details on calcimimetic. In Q1, 2019, we generated revenue about $17 per treatment with costs of about $11 per treatment from calcimimetic creating a temporary quarter-over-quarter tailwind of just over $20 million. For the rest of 2019, we continue to expect calcimimetic to be one of the biggest swing factors in our OI forecast. Longer term, we continue to expect that calcimimetic will be margin neutral to slightly negative depending on how reimbursement is set. As a reminder, the first quarter tends to be the seasonally weakest quarter of the year due to fewer treatment days, higher payroll taxes and the impact of the flu season. Moving to internationals, we generated a $2 million adjusted operating loss in the quarter, which included a currency loss of approximately $1 million, but excluded the $41 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our German dialysis business. The small decline in adjusted operating income from last quarter was a result of approximately three fewer treatment days. For the full year, we continue to expect to achieve profitable adjusted operating income internationally before any currency gains or losses from our APAC joint venture. For the quarter, our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations excluding the goodwill impairment charge was 30.1%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita for the full year to be 28.5% to 29.5%. Our adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations were $0.91. Now on to cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter was $73 million .This cash flow was adversely impacted by the timing of working capital. It was an increase in accounts receivable as DSOs for the US dialysis and lab business increased sequentially by four days to 64 days in Q1, 2019 due to some temporary factors that we expect to normalize over the next couple of quarters. We also saw a reduction of accrued compensation due to timing of 401-k contribution, bonus payments and a reduction in accounts payable. CapEx for continuing operations for the quarter was a $179 million excluding the impact of $12 million of proceeds from sale leased backed transactions. In light of the changes in our growth rate, we continue to scrutinize our capital deployment. Keep in mind that the timeline from inception of a project to signing a lease and eventually providing a dialysis treatment is nearly two years. So much of this impact will be felt in 2020 and beyond. We are reaffirming our adjusted operating income guidance for the year of $1.54 billion to $1.64 billion. And our guidance on cash flow from continuing operations of $1.375 billion to $1.575 billion. As always, our guidance is built to incorporate the impact of expected swing factors, although there are scenarios in which we could end up above or below this range. Now, I'll turn it over to Kent for closing comments. Kent Thiry : Before we go to Q&A, I just like to share a few of my perspectives on the industry, on the community looking back over the 20 years in the hope that that might be useful, particularly to a number the people who are much newer shareholders to the space. Please allow me eight points. Number one, we never want to forget that we're providing an essential therapy. It's not disputable; it's not debatable; it's not controversial. Who needs dialysis or why the value it provides that is a good thing for people. It's a good thing for shareholders. Number two, the presence of an uncomfortable cost subsidy, perhaps one of the most extreme in American healthcare where the private sector has to subsidize the roughly 90% of our patients that our government pay. This is bad. It's a bad way to organize the healthcare system, but it's been this way now for thirty years and the good news about it is it's the same for every single player in the space. At number three, we've never been without intense productivity pressure. The derivative benefit of that is we are perhaps the most productive healthcare service segment in all of America, in all of the Medicare program. Number four; there's been a continuous stream over the 20 years of existential threats towards the business model. By that I mean existential threats that people said would either dramatically impair or destroy the economic viability of the business model, things like everybody is going to be able to do a wearable kidney things like diabetes incidence is going to plummet with a new drug, or stop advancing. I could list example after example through the course of the last 20 years. Of course, none of those existential threats have ever materialized, which is not to say there haven't been activities in all those realms, but never have they done anything like what some people feared and always we've been able to adjust and ride those new waves successfully and sustain our leadership. Number five of eight, DaVita in particular excellent, clinical performance and a fervent belief in transparency around clinical outcomes. In addition, our entire industry has improved care and the productivity care in ways that most of the rest of chronic health care America would envy. Number six, periodic policy opportunities and threats. We are and we work in very close concert with the federal government and to some extent the states, will always be the case. For sometimes they will do things that temporarily repairs there will also be opportunities where we can improve our value alignment with the government. So just give one example of how significant the math can be. We recently had to endure five years of essentially flat Medicare reimbursement. Cumulatively that made it $386 million per year difference in incremental revenue versus not. The resiliency of the business model to endure that over the prior five years, the recent five years and now entering back into a period of rate normalcy is quite noteworthy. Number seven, the inexorable march towards integrated care. And this is relevant on a couple different levels. First, the degree, the depth and breadth and fervency of policy support from both these and ours for integrated care not only for our patients but for all chronic care patients is really at an all-time high and shows no signs of reversing. So from a policy point of view that march is picking up speed. Let's also not forget, however, that we are in a unique pole position to take care of these very expensive and needy patients, who just happen to have dialysis is a common denominator because what they also have are diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression et cetera, et cetera. And therefore our pole position, our unique position of relationship combined with all the capabilities that we've invested in, put us in a great spot for what is an emerging tidal wave we hope for America and for its patients. And finally number eight, the ability of this business model to convert operating income into free cash flow and free cash flow into sustainable earnings per share accomplishments. In the context of all that those eight points, we have moved equity value from $150 million 20 years ago to over $9 million today and hopefully significantly more value for you soon, for our patients soon and for our taxpayers soon. And if I were to just step back for a second and stare at the current platform, sweet things are quite striking. The resiliency of us and our community is noteworthy. Second, our relative performance within that world consistently over the last 20 years. And third and finally, our opportunity for increased differentiation moves up with every rise of integrated care. And so we're looking forward to being evermore differentiated in ways that are ever more driven by our historic capabilities, our historic investments in our current market position. With that operator, if we could please turn it over to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. KevinFischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to see I guess, Kent, I think you said that the quarter came in slightly ahead of your expectations but then when Javier was talking about the revenue number, you talked about volumes coming in later. Can you just go into what was it that came in better than your expectations to get the operating income number I guess little bit better. JoelAckerman: Sure. Hi, Kevin. It's Joel. I'll take that. Our internal number was a bit lower than the streets, largely driven I think by timing related to seasonality. So that's I think the genesis of that comment. I would say the single biggest thing that drove the number stronger was calcimimetic. And I mentioned in my script about a $20 million tailwind in calcimimetic in Q1 versus Q4. KevinFischbeck: And can you kind of remind us what you think the pace of that? You talked about ultimately that becoming a neutral or maybe even slightly negative thing. Is that slowly by yearend or is that a two-year? How to think about that process? JoelAckerman: Yes. So I think you have to think about the margin in calcimimetic in two buckets. So start with what we had last year which we've called out as mid to high single digit which is kind of where we were as 2018, think of that as the baseline that will go away over time probably measured in years but not many years as the whole dynamic of generic entrance plays through, and that gives the temporary tailwind which is the $20 million that's the second piece. But then ultimately plays through to ASP. So the $20 million that extra tailwind that we saw in Q1, we don't know how that will play out over the rest of the year. There's certainly a possibility that we will be able to continue to buy at generic rates in Q2 before ASP falls, and there'll be a continued tailwind in Q2. We don't know what will happen in the second half of the year. There is a scenario where that completely reverses where generic availability in the market disappears, while ASP is falling and what was a tailwind in Q1 will turn into a headwind in the back of it, half of the year.  So I think to try and sum this up, I think the mid to high single digit number that we called out in 2018, we think that will persist through 2019. How long it lasts after that is a question mark. This added $20 million tailwind could persist for a little bit while longer although it could flatten out, and it could potentially turn into a headwind in the back half of the year, all depending on what happens with generics supply and ultimately what happens with ASP. KevinFischbeck: Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, as I said I'm not sure if you said I didn't catch it, but commercial mix in the quarter, any comment on how that trended? KentThiry: Yes. The mix was slightly higher quarter-over-quarter and now this add since you asked, as we step back and look over what we said at JPMorgan, I wish the range was a little wider because that number sort of pops up and down. But in general, we were slightly up and there's nothing in the mix that would change or impact our guidance. KevinFischbeck: Can you talk about a little bit about some of the things that you mentioned as far as volume headwinds? Is there anything within the volume headwinds that would have a directional impact on mix? Are the things that are -- some of the things you mentioned as far as transplant facility, I think that might actually be more of a headwind to commercial mix than to Medicare mix for example. I don't know how you think about that but love to hear your comments on those pressures and how they apply to mix. KentThiry: Sure. Let me take a stab and see if I'm answering your question. First, I just want to say, embarrass, we got it wrong at JPMorgan. And we gave and we missed the numbers so quickly after that. Two is that we have a track record about performing on non acquired growth. And we've had some episodic quarters where our competitors about performance. And three, is that there's a lot going into this number. There's an incident. There's mortality. There are transplants; there are competitors; there's peered dynamic and they're all moving in opposite direction. Sometimes so it's very hard to pinpoint the number, but at the end what we're trying to do is work really hard to make sure that we get the right trade-off between growth rate and capital deployment. And that's really what it's all about, KevinFischbeck: All right. Then maybe just my last question. Clearly, you're seeing a slowdown in volume because your competitors are ramping up de novo, is there any way to kind of quantify in your view, market share I guess losses maybe that are happening which you have said that real numbers should have been 2.5, 3.5, it was just a market share that pushed you down below that or how do you think about market share? KentThiry: Yes. It's a good question. I mean if you look at market share and you look at what that 1% difference is over a year. This is only a quarter but over a year it'd be about 2,000 patients. So you got to look at in the base that we have roughly 200,000 and so does FMC. But we don't take it lightly of course compounding is very powerful, but again our track record that will outperform over time. But when you look at it sometimes you would rather have a lower growth. If it's got an impact on your deployment of capital. And so you can't isolate each one of these and micro but you got to look at the sort of overall portfolio. Because we could give you a higher nag number but it might be with lower returns on certain de novo and so we're being quite disciplined and scrutinizing that number. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. JustinLake: Thanks. Good late afternoon I guess. First off, congrats, Kent on 20 years and retirement and Javier no surprise, but congrats on you taking the reign for exciting stuff. The first question I had, Javier, you kind of step in here, I feel like a big part of Kent's role as you take, as you've kind of been running the dialysis business for a while. And Kent's role has been in a very much kind of strategy and capital deployment and the move to international for instance, the DMG. So I'd love to hear your kind of thoughts on how you see the next kind of three to five years from a capital deployment perspective that might have been different than Kent's. And specifically given this deal looks like it's moving towards closed, your thoughts on how to deploy that capital especially given where the stock is? JavierRodriguez: Well, as Kent articulated, Justin, we worked together in partnership for 20 years. So I've gotten that question asked a fair amount and what I've said it's not like I've been shelving my idea is waiting for the time where I got to home and now I get to execute on them. We've been partners and we think a lot of like is it relate to the discipline on capital. And as I said in my opening remark, there's more that's going to look the same than anything that's going to look different. Things that would likely look different will be more around the evolution of time, technology and the needs of the business and a greater care policy and those things that we will be driving. As it relates to capital, we have and we will continue to have a very strong discipline around capital. And we are going to be sharing our three year plan and capital market in August or September. I don't want to provide any more detail at this point. JustinLake: Got it. And then you talked about calcimimetic and the $20 million of benefit versus the fourth quarter. Can you give me that the total benefits in the quarter here? KentThiry: I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand the question, Justin. Are you saying the total calcimimetic profit in the quarter? So, it's roughly double $20 million. So it's a $20 million headwind combined with the number we had called out in the past which you recall it $80 million. So $38 million would be the total Q1 profit from calcimimetic. JustinLake:  Got it. And is your view that that calcimimetic potentially will not be a benefit next year, so we should think about that as a headwind year-over-year to numbers? KentThiry: I think it's hard to call out the timing. We think ultimately most if not all of this will go away; don't know whether it's a 2020 event or 2021. JustinLake: Got it. Is there anything you could share with us in terms of how, so if you're at a $40 million run rate, it sounded like the answer to Kevin's question was that you thought that could continue in the quarter, in the second quarter and then could moderate in the back half of the year. But what do you have baked in the guidance for the full year in terms of the calcimimetic benefit even if it's a range? It'd be helpful to kind of understand. KentThiry: Yes, we -- there are a lot of scenarios that play through the ranges is in the forecast. So I don't think I'd be comfortable articulating just a single number that flows through. But I think it is safe to say what we've said in the past, which is some of this variability in the near term around calcimimetic is the single biggest swing factor in the $100 million of OI I range that we gave in our guidance. JustinLake: Okay. And if I think I had obviously it's early for 2020 but is there anything that if this does start to moderate? Is there anything that you can think of that could kind of an offsetting benefit in 2020 some kind of tailwind like maybe the your EPO contract could potentially help offset that. Anything that you want to point us to before we think about-- as we think about 2020 headwinds and tailwinds? KentThiry: Yes. So, I think there's a lot going on in pharma in general and that applies to unit price, it applies to unit volume. It applies across a number of the drugs we use. So I wouldn't point out a specific headwind or tailwind, but I don't think you can look at this as one isolated factor in the P&L and just handle it as its own issue. JustinLake: Got it. If I could sneak in one more. I know last year and I apologize for not having run these numbers myself but just kind of thinking it through. Last year, I remember your first quarter had a benefit from a Medicare receivable true-up of some sort and this year obviously as a calcimimetic benefit. If I remember correctly last year did not have much of a benefit from calcimimetic. I think it\u2019s sort of ramping slowly. Is that correct? KentThiry: That is correct. I believe, yes. JustinLake: Got it. So if I net the two right and if I kind of think about growth year-over-year in the first quarter excluding calcimimetic and the Medicare true-up. Can you do that math top of your head and give us an idea of what they year-over-year first quarter looked like? KentThiry: So, if you went back to Q1 last year, you'd have to take out the Medicare bad debt. You also have to take out the DHS $70 million one-time pick up that we called out back then. If you looked at that number relative to where we came out this quarter, I believe it would be up a bit. But that would not be adjusting for calcimimetic. JoelAckerman: I think that math would be somewhere at 371 to 382 and we had one less treatment day year-over-year. JeffreyMeuler: So [Multiple Speakers] 382 and then I would back out $38 million for calcimimetic. Is that what you're saying? KentThiry: I think that 38 would be high. I don't remember what we had in there. What we what exactly we called out but the 38 would be high. We can take it offline, Justin, and get you a better number. We've just got to look back at what we --what we disclosed. JavierRodriguez: Yes. I just offer a cautionary note on two levels here. One when we start this around too many variables on a live call. There's a lot of room for potential confusion on exactly how people are defining different numbers and then second, it sort of stating the obvious but worthwhile that in any given year we've got lots of variables that move $15 million - $20 million recurring, non-recurring up down and so it gets pretty tricky to start paying too much attention to one or two of them because there's a lot of them all the time. Operator : Thank you. Next in queue we have Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. SteveTanal: Good afternoon, guys. Congrats to Kent, Javier as well. I guess just the first question just in light of the updates on DMG and the commentary around the industry growth and more de novo from competitors. Could you kind of give us your latest thoughts on the potential deployment of DMG proceeds? Or what is your thought processes around that at this point? KentThiry: Yes. So our thinking on that hasn't changed. The DMG proceeds will go to pay down debt after the deal closes. We're going to do a subsequent financing and we'll use those proceeds to bring us back to our historical leverage range 3x to 3.5x, and use that to buy back stock. So nothing really has changed around our thinking there, SteveTanal: Perfect, thank you. And a couple more sort of granular ones. I guess I'm just on calcimimetic discussion just to round that out the $11 cost per treatment, would you be able to give us that figure sort of for your last quarters? If you think about the houses of development. KentThiry: Yes. It was --it was, hold on, bear with me one second. It was about $13. SteveTanal: Got it, okay. So it really does sort of seem like I guess the generic availability is maybe what changed here. Just thinking broader about patient care costs per treatment. It was considerably lower there. Are there any other drivers that you could talk about in that line that we should think about as potentially a more sustainable? KentThiry: Are you talking about the calcimimetic question? I'm sorry. SteveTanal: No. I am sorry. Just inside of patient care costs sort of --like a per treatment basis came in quite a bit better, just trying to understand some of the other moving pieces as well. KentThiry: Yes. So the other piece is EPO. SteveTanal: EPO is better. KentThiry: Yes. SteveTanal: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just one more maybe on the commercial side. Sounds like mixes up a little bit, maybe if you just comment on rate as well just as we think about RPTs in the quarter? KentThiry: I think there's no headline on the rate side. Basically in line with where we expected it. SteveTanal: Got it, okay. And sort of a continuation I suppose is like what was laid out at the JPM day. Just I think there's a decline in that network rates and sort of the outlier stuff but an increase on the rest of the book like that's all still pretty much what's playing out. KentThiry: Yes. Nothing to call out. SteveTanal: Great, okay, all right, thanks. Actually I guess just one last one. Just on the advocacy side is anything to note there just with AV290 or anything else on your minds. Are you still really comfortable with the $60 million step-down in the guide sort of sounds like it but just want to check in there? KentThiry: Yes. The short answer is we continue to work with AV290 baby and we are comfortable with our advocacy spend and our progress in our relationships in Sacramento and another state capital. Operator : Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is now open. WhitMayo: Hey, thanks. Congrats Kent and Javier, both well-deserved. Maybe just wanted to follow up on the competitive dynamics one more time. Just might be helpful to define competition a little bit more. Is this just new competitor that you're seeing or is this de novo activity from existing competition within your markets? And do you have any view on last year's AKI regulatory changes with sniff reimbursement and whether or not you're seeing any activity on that side? KentThiry: Yes. On the first part, it is not the new entrants. We are not seeing any significant activity there. So it is with the existing competitors. On the AKI, for those people that are not familiar, it stands for acute kidney injury and basically that's before a doctor concludes that your kidneys are end-stage meaning they could come back. And so there was a change in philosophy there because they wanted to get the patients out of the hospital and into the most efficient side of care, which is our centers and so there are more diagnoses now AKI because it's system adjusted to that. I think that volume has gone through the system and I don't think it's relevant for nag factors. WhitMayo: Okay. And maybe one more on the calcimimetic. Is there any way to maybe frame up what percent in the quarter was generic versus branded since apart just in terms of dosing and did anything really surprise you positively or negatively since your last call on this one topic? KentThiry: On the mix, the majority of the mix ended up being on the generic side. And as it relates to surprise, I would never call it a surprise. We just knew it was going to be a fluid and dynamic time. And so we're going through a bit of the waves, if you will. In this particular quarter, it was helpful and that we were able to purchase some at a discount and then of course Joel already explained that could be reversed at anytime depend how it plays out, ventures and how the pricing curve drops. WhitMayo: Got it. In any way to maybe frame-up what the inventory looks like going forward just to get a sense of how much visibility you have into additional generic opportunities? KentThiry: No. It is very --it's been very hard to tell because of dynamics in the legal system as to what inventory is available on who's going to enter. And then of course that will drive the price to have any entrance and how much inventory. So we are just as interested as you are in those numbers, but they're very hard to find. WhitMayo: Yes, no, totally got it. Maybe just one last one and just curious Javier as you make the rounds and talk to your medical directors and nephrologist. Are you hearing anything new from clinical protocols therapies just anything aside from since, I am just trying to think from an upstream perspective if there's any change you're seeing within the nephrology practice setting? Thanks. JavierRodriguez: No. There's nothing to call out. The physicians are continuing to prescribe as they have in the past. Of course, they're always looking at the journals and the studies to see if there's anything in the science that indicates anything new, but there's nothing that I would call out right now. Operator : Next in queue we have Gary Taylor from J. P. Morgan. GaryTaylor: Hi, guys. Just a few quick ones. I think Joel mentioned in terms of patient expenses that our EPO cost, I was just wondering if that was price or utilization. JavierRodriguez: Price. GaryTaylor: Thank you. And I wanted to ask, I've been on the call for long time, not 20 years, but a long time, haven't heard you talk about competitor de novo activity a lot. I understand you're saying it's existing competitors. But wanted to see if you had any comment on some of the new startups that are focused on CKD market like cricket and cricket is modest that is basically saying not enough resources have been expended. At CKD, we spend all our resources once the person hits ESRD and I think Azar comments were hinted at that or alluded to that a little bit as well. But how do you see that developing as positive, negative, hospital risk, the ESRD volumes, et cetera? KentThiry: Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relates to competition, the first thing I'll say is competition makes us sharper. And we respect all competitors and so it's with that approach that we go paranoid at it because we want to make sure that our patients get the best. And we believe that we are best prepared to deliver that in a platform with all the types of care. That said, of course, when you are small and you're getting capitalized, you need to generate a story and so the provocative story is one that says that they're going to disrupt and innovate. And we believe that we've been self disrupting and innovating for quite some time when we do a lot of patient education more than anyone else. We send more patients to the proper modality than anyone else. We have amazing transplant education and so we know we have the entire suite, but of course they can't compete with that platform and so what they want to do is create a narrative that we are by definition of being big that we somehow or other not innovative which is of course not the entrepreneurial spirit of DaVita. So again we want to be sharp and we want to take them on and we respect it. JavierRodriguez: And Gary I would go ahead and add on a little bit here, giving us up a question that that number one, it's easy to say I found a thousand CKD patients, people with kidney disease, but the kidneys haven't failed yet. It is tough to say which ones of those are most likely to have kidney failure and when. And it is impossible to say what would have happened otherwise. So in order for anyone to pay you other anything other than a low unsatisfactory fee-for-service rate means you need to have sufficient data to be able to take a scaled population, know what they would have cost, so you can give someone a share the savings of what they did cost after you intervened. There is no one better positioned than we are to turn those unknowns into knowns and none of the new entrants have that capability currently, which is not to say they're smart and they, and if they get enough money, it's a very, it's a doable thing. It's not an easy thing. It's not a cheap thing. I appreciate the comments. GaryTaylor: I appreciate the comments. One more quick one for Joel, if I could. You alluded to the fact that if not a core treatment growth stated this level, you be at risk of missing the treatment growth guidance for the year. Obviously, this quarter despite the weaker volume, you made it up on the OI side. So when you look at the year, you're contemplating the possibility could come at low end on of treatment, but you reiterated OI guidance. So is the messaging just from that. Are there are enough other puts and takes that even at the low end or slightly below and on volume you hit the OI range? JoelAckerman: That's exactly right, Gary. We've got enough other things that week that were not worried about the OI range even if we come in below on that. Operator : Our next question from John Ransom of Raymond James. Your line is now open. JohnRansom: Hi. Just wondering when you think you might get some color from CMMI on the reimbursement changes relative to home reimbursement versus clinic reimbursement. KentThiry: This is KT here. It's difficult to predict these things and they have a couple of times predicted when they'll have stuffs done and they haven't been able to get it done. Not because they're not smart and hardworking, don't have good ideas. We applaud so much of what they're working on and so much what they're creating, but they have to go through a multi-agency approval process over which they do not have total control. So it's very difficult to know and sometimes they can't even know. If someone gets to it in the next two weeks, it's done in two weeks. If they don't get to in 10 weeks, it's not done for 10 weeks even though the elapsed time of the work might only be a week or two, things get pretty busy there. So unfortunately we can't give you a helpful response. JohnRansom: So those of us who get paid to speculate with zero information which would you wildly object to the notion of let's say today we have 100 treatments and 88 in the clinic and 12 at the home. I guess they're going to pull some money out of the total pie, but it would it be as perhaps the straightforward is saying, well, maybe we'll pay 5% less at the clinic and we'll pay 20% more for home and those dollars kind of roughly balance out. Or do you think it'll be a lot more dramatic and complicated and hard to figure out? KentThiry: Yes. I don't think speculating is a good idea because that's literally what the accurate verb would be. And so it'll just have to wait. I'm very, very sorry but we can't predict. Operator : Next in queue we have Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hey, good afternoon. It's Justin Bowers on for Pedo. And congratulations Kent for moving on and Javier for assuming the reign. Just in terms of some of the moving pieces with the receivables, what --can you provide us a little more detail on why the jump there and in terms of timing, how --should we expect that to go back to where you ended it 4Q towards the end of the year, in the middle of the year? A little better sense of [Technical Difficult] it would be helpful. KentThiry: Sure. So Peter, there wasn't any individual thing. It was a bunch of things. Some of which are operational, some of which are seasonal, but all of which are temporary. We would expect in the next couple of quarters that this will all play through and we'll be back to the range where we were and kind of the back half of 2018 and to give you a flavor. I'll call out one thing we did a system change in one of our smaller businesses. A billing system change and that led to some operational complexity that led to some just temporary spike in the AR but we've worked that through. Now we're just catching up. That was the single biggest thing that was roughly 40% of the four days. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay, that's helpful, Joel. And was any of that related to not the 40% but let's say the other 60% related to any of your contracts made on the commercial side? And then in light of kind of the improvement and mix quarter-over-quarter is there any way that we can narrow the range there from the guidance you gave earlier in the year in terms of commercial RPT? KentThiry: Yes. Justin, first I apologize for getting your name wrong. I don't see any linkage there; I don't think you can connect the two. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. And then in terms of the commercial RPT for where we are, you guys still-- are you sticking to your guns there in terms of the guidance that you provided or? KentThiry:  Yes. No change on that. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. And then just shifting gears a bit looking towards like 2020 and an MA and the opportunity there, any kind of color you can provide on some of the discussions that you're having with the payers, maybe in terms of some of the different programs you'd set up and maybe some of the programs that you can run with them, thinking of the comment you made on the hospital readmissions and overall like what's the rate environment there from MA? KentThiry: Yes. Justin, as you can imagine there's interest because people are trying to run their models as to what's going to happen to that population. The reality is, it's got a lot of variables and at the end, and it ends up in being a patient choice as to what product they have. And so as it relates to the actual negotiation, we're continuing to have very constructive conversations with the payers as to how we can take risk on the MA business. And we're actually innovating quite a lot in that book of business. So it's a constructive productive conversation. Operator : Next in queue we have [Indiscernible]. Your line is open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi. Just a quick one for me. Looks like you had $400 million revolver draw sequentially. Just wondering what the use of proceeds was for that? KentThiry: I think you should tie that to some of the comments we've made about DSOs and the move in AP, so it was just largely around working capital. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. So, then that's expected to come down then in the interim quarters? KentThiry:  Yes. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. Speakers, we show no further questions in queue at this time. Kent Thiry : All right. Thank you all very much for your kind attention. We'll talk to you again soon. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin the conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, Darin, and welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in the company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. Please note that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our second quarter earnings press release, our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and any subsequent filings with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to usand we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim. And good afternoon and thank you for joining the call today. It's nice to be with you as I host my first earnings call as the CEO of the enterprise. As I reflect on my first 60 days, it's been a dynamic time. In that short period of time, the President of United States issued an executive order on kidney health. We closed the DMG transaction, we bought back $350 million of stock, we commenced the tender process to purchase up to another 1.2 billion of stock, we launched a new bank financing, and, most importantly, our team of dedicated caregivers performed over 5 million life sustaining dialysis treatments, hard to believe that it's only been 60 days. Before providing financial details on the quarter, let me start with a clinical highlight. DaVita has had a long commitment to helping as many patients as possible receive kidney transplants. We have created award winning educational programs to support our patients to increase their chances of receiving a transplant. These programs include pure testimonial and animated videos on how to prepare for a transplant evaluation, how to stay active on the waitlist, how to find a living donor, and what to expect after transplant. We're encouraged by the interests of our current administration to try to improve on the biggest challenge, which is actually organ supply. We will continue to support the efforts to help patients on the waitlist receive a transplant, so they can join the estimated 50,000 DaVita patients who are living with a transplant today. Now, let's move on to the quarterly performance which we previewed with you in a press release last week. We saw a strong financial performance in the second quarter. On the positive side, we had a sequential increase in revenue per treatment and a sequential decrease in our costs. On the negative side, non-acquired growth was disappointing. Joel will walk through the numbers, but I thought it'd be helpful to provide you with qualitative views of the drivers. Our year to year, sorry, our year-to-date revenue per treatment continues to be in line with revenue guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Commercial rates are slightly up year-over-year, and Medicare rates are growing in line with our expectation. Team performed well on cost management with solid improvement in the quarter, primarily due to productivity improvements. Transitioning to growth, we're disappointed with our performance on non-acquired growth, which continues to fall below our expectations. While some of the decrease is related to the slowdown in industry patient growth, there is no getting around the fact that we're underperforming the industry. The question we've been working through are, what is the potential for improvement and when will we see the result? Unfortunately, our response is dissatisfying. We're not ready to commit to specific numbers or timing. On a local market basis, it's proven challenge to differentiate between true underperformance and just good decision-making. We're evaluating opportunities market by market and trying to balance that sometimes conflicting goals of growth, productivity, and capital efficiency. Let me drill down through an example to bring the point to life. A common decision in any given clinic is whether to open a new shift. Most new shifts are temporarily cost inefficient due to the low capacity utilization. If the market has scale, capacity constraint, robust growth, the decision is pretty easy. You open the shift. If the market is small or the growth rate is inconsistent, it might make sense to trade the growth for productivity efficiency. Another example that's playing out in real time is in California, we have only signed two new leases in California this year, which compares to a typical full-year of closer to 25 to 30. This will have a negative growth consequence in the future but will reduce capital deployment in a market where we feel it is not prudent to invest at this time, given the threats of disruption from SEIU. These examples illustrate the trade-offs between growth, productivity, and capital, which highlight we're not looking at any metric in isolation. Now, let me comment on President Trump's executive order. My high level takeaway on the executive order is, we are aligned, we are well positioned, it's early and the economic impact is uncertain. Now, let me expand on each. First, we're well aligned with the administration overarching goal to provide better education to patient to increase home dialysis and to increase the number of transplants. We agree that early education of patients is critical to slowing progression of kidney disease and to increase the chances that more patients will be able to choose the best treatment option for their lifestyle. Second, in partnership with nephrologists, we believe we're well positioned across the continuum of patient care. We're the largest provider of home dialysis in the country and have a full integrated technology platform to make it easier for patients to treat at home. We have a robust education resource offering over 12,000 education classes to CKD patients this year alone to empower more patients to choose home as their preferred modality. We have strong partnerships with over 900 hospitals across the country and we believe that we have a head start in building necessary capabilities to manage full risk in an integrated care environment. Third, with respect with the economic model, the administration announced the intention to pilot five new programs for kidney patients, one mandatory and four voluntary. Few details have been provided on the voluntary models. So, we're not in a position to provide much insight into our strategic approach to drive growth or profitability from these models. What we know about the mandatory model is that there will be an increased payment tied to home penetration and transplant rate. This will consist of two major components. First is a rate increase of 3% in year one for home dialysis, we expect this to result in approximately $5 million to $10 million revenue pick up for us in 2020, which will decline in subsequent years as the rate increase goes away. The second component, which is probably the most important, is the potential for higher or lower revenues based on [indiscernible] clinics driven by performance on home and transplant. CMS expects this to have a negative impact on Medicare reimbursement to the dialysis industry. Given that the dialysis industry already loses money on Medicare reimbursement, we will have to work with CMMI to ensure sustainability long-term economics. However, if it remains as announced and if 50% of our clinics nationwide are part of the demonstration, we should expect to also have some negative impact on our Medicare reimbursement. The community is working hard to better understand the rule and its implications. We intend to provide input and the 60-day comment period to highlight where the regulation may be improved. Now on to Joel to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. Operating income for the quarter was strong. Let me walk you through some of the details starting with the components of the US dialysis and lab segment. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 2.1%. Given the first half of the year performance, we now expect non-acquired growth to be between 1.75% and 2.25% in the second half of the year, which would put the full year between 2% and 2.25%, falling short of the guidance we provided earlier this year. Revenue per treatment was up sequentially by $1.60, driven by some positive fluctuations in rate partially offset by a decline in calcimimetics reimbursement and a slight decline in commercial mix. Excluding the impact of calcimimetics, an incremental Medicare bad debt revenue recognized in 2018 on the adoption of the new revenue standard, year to date, revenue per treatment is in line with our full-year guidance. Patient care costs were down approximately $9 per treatment quarter over quarter, driven primarily by improved productivity, seasonal declines in payroll taxes, lower benefit expenses and lower costs for calcimimetics. We do expect some of this favorability to reverse in the second half of the year. Dialysis and lab segment G&A was up quarter over quarter at $1.68 per treatment due to increases in professional fees, the timing of our annual national meeting, and increased compensation expense. This increase in compensation expense in the quarter is mostly formulaic, as it is driven by the improved operating income expectations for 2019. We expect G&A for treatment for the second half of 2019 to be relatively flat with this quarter. Moving on to calcimimetics, we've benefited year to date from multiple launches of generic oral drugs, which have led to declining acquisition prices. Because the reimbursement methodology lags these costs decreases by approximately six months, we have temporarily benefitted until reimbursement declines. In Q2 2019, we generated operating income of approximately $40 million from calcimimetics. This is approximately $14 per treatment of revenue and cost of about $9 per treatment. For 2019, we think the most likely range for the net operating income benefit from calcimimetics will be $125 million to $150 million. We do not expect this to occur in future years. Our current estimate is that the future operating income contributions from calcimimetics will be roughly breakeven. In international for the quarter, we generated approximately $1 million of operating income and we continue to expect to generate positive adjusted operating income for the year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations for the quarter was 27.9%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted tax -- we continue to expect our effective adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita for the full year to be between 28.5% and 29.5%. Now on to cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter was $574 million. DSOs for the US dialysis and lab business declined sequentiallyby one day to 63 days in Q2 2019. Reported CapEx for continuing operations for the quarter was $156 million. For 2019, we expect to report approximately 120 de novos. This represents the number of new centers that are certified in the year and is primarily the result of decisions that were made approximately two years ago. The actual numbers of centers that we are building in 2019 is significantly lower. Our current forecast for new center construction for 2019 is approximately 80 centers. This will result in fewer certified centers reported next year. As noted in our releaselast week, we increased our adjusted operating income guidance for the year to $1.64 billion to $1.7 billion. We're also increasing operating cash flow to $1.45 billion to $1.625 billion consistent with a tax effective change to our adjusted operating income. As always, our guidance is built to incorporate the impact of expected swing factors, although there are scenarios in which we could end up above or below this range. Now, I'll turn it over to Javier for some closing remarks. Javier Rodriguez : Thanks, Joel. While it's too early to provide guidance for 2020, there are three specific call outs regarding next year above and beyond the normal puts and takes. Number one, we expect the operating income from calcimimetics to go away as Joel mentioned earlier. Number two, we expect the potential headwind from union driven ballot initiatives, and number three, CMS preliminary proposed net market basket update for 2020 is approximately 1.7. I am looking forward to providing more color on our strategy on our upcoming Capital Markets Day which is now September 10 in New York. So, that is it. Darin, if you could open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have one question in queue from Kevin Fischbeck. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. So, I guess, I can ask all the questions that I want. So, I guess, you mentioned, I guess, kind of in the pre-announcement that the substantial majority of the increase in guidance was due to calcimimetics. Were there other dynamics that came in favorably that you're now expecting to come in favorably for the rest of the year that are contributing to the guidance range? Joel Ackerman : As I look at the rest of the year, obviously they're ranges in there. But, I'd say, the core business, the general dynamics are revenues coming in as expected, labor is favorable, growth is unfavorable. You put that all together, the core is relatively in line with what we were expecting. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then the volume growth numbers, obviously, you kind of now feel like there is a market share loss that's going on there. And I appreciate you can't at this point yet say when it will improve, but I guess kind of most definitionally, if you're talking about doing fewer de novos, doesn't that mean that it's not going to get better next year, and it\u2019s going to get worse or is there some offsetting dynamic to that that we should be thinking about volume being similar or better next year? Joel Ackerman : So, on the de novo issue specifically, it depends a lot on what the rest of the industry builds. Our expectation is that as the industry growth slows and there's a shift to home, we'll be building fewer centers. What the rest of the industry chooses to do, it's hard to predict. So that's the dynamic there. In terms of industry growth looking forward, again hard to predict, you look at the USRDS data, which has a few quarter lag, you can certainly see a slow down there. You layer on to that, the more real time numbers we're seeing in terms of transplants, and that growth seems -- I mean, it's still early but it seems to be accelerating for 2019. So you put that all together, and it's again hard to predict what will happen to the industry. But it's not hard to see that continuing to slow as well. Javier Rodriguez : So said another way on the first point, Kevin, the question is, will the industry operate at a higher utilization and therefore the de novo count doesn't equal non-acquired growth? Kevin Fischbeck : Well, I guess, like when you decided to slow down your de novo growth, my impression was it was in large part due to a view that the industry growth was slowing. Now you don't think that if your growth is slowing as much. So, I guess, that might mean that you are in fact going to be opening fewer de novos than your competitors next year. Javier Rodriguez : We do think the industry growth is slowing. That's what we've seen over the last few years. You see it in the USRDS data. So, I might have created some confusion, but we do see -- we do expect the growth to slow down. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. But that was not the only reason why you slowed it down. It was also a view that there would be a shift to home as well. Javier Rodriguez : Definitely. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. And then I guess, you talked about how the new payment model is going to have incentives around shift to home. And then you mentioned that you thought that you would be negatively impacted because the industry overall was going to be negatively impacted. What is your thought process at least as far as your initial review of the criteria for that bonus payment? Is it that you're such a big part of the industry that it's hard for you to be anything but average or do you feel like right now you're probably going to be better than average, but still not enough to overcome the rate cuts, how are you seeing that shape up? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. We have very little information on it other than directionally what they want to do or what they mention is to move the curve to the left, if you will. And when you're as big as we are, 37%, you assume that at some point, you're going to look a bit like the curve. And so, they have not given us much colors. There's a point system, et cetera, but we don't know how it will work. And that's one of the things that we're trying to shape in the 60-day comment period, because of course we would like that to have some upside for those that outperform. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. And maybe my last question. I think you've talked about that shift to home over the next five years, I guess, what exactly is your expectation for total industry growth during that time period, because I think that initially with the shift to home chemo, there's been some home dialysis. There's been some concern that if there's a big shift to home that it will create negative leverage on your sites. Does that shift to home chemo or home dialysis that you're assuming in the next five years, does that still assume core growth on the in-center business and therefore no negative leverage or is there potential lapse scenario where you are successful in shifting to home and there are some positive profitability from doing that, but then there's negative offset at the in-site performance. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. So, Kevin, you'd have to look at this market-by-market, and there could be some markets where our in-center capacity becomes less utilized as a result of this. But if you look at it in general across the country, we don't expect to create any sort of trap G&A or underleveraging of the centers through the growth of home. We think there will be enough industry growth to satisfy the increased shift to home without emptying out centers. Joel Ackerman : And it's important to remember, Kevin that roughly 80% of patients that are home end up in-center. And so, the continuum of care is necessary throughout a patient's journey. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : So first off, obviously a much better quarter in 2Q. I don't think I've ever seen cost decline sequentially like that without some bigger picture kind of item changing. So, I was hoping you can give us some color on the cost per treatment in the second quarter, a little more color on what drove it and how sustainable is it into the back half of the year? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, Justin, the two biggest drivers were labor productivity and calcimimetics. The calcimimetics, I think, we've called out that number should continue to decline over the rest of the year. In terms of labor productivity, it was a big jump. It was great performance by the team as we think about how that plays out for the rest of the year. We think there is certainly the possibility that some of that reverses itself. We're looking carefully at seasonality in the current environment. There is some seasonality to turnover, which generates seasonal patterns of training that can be higher in the back half of the year. And as training goes up, labor productivity comes down. Justin Lake : Okay. And then, in terms of your updated guidance, when I try to put pen to paper on the back -- run the back of the envelope math. When I think about the increase in calcimimetics year-over-year, the contribution is obviously enormous. If you look at some other moving parts, and I wanted to kind of get your viewpoint here. But I think you guys kind of agreed in the first quarter, your core growth was down about 3% to 4% ex-moving parts. And it looks like it's about plus 4% in the second, so maybe flat for the year-to-date. And then, the guidance seems to imply about flat maybe even down slightly ex-moving parts in the back half of the year. So I just wanted to get an idea, is that kind of ballpark to how you've seen the business in terms of what you saw in the first half and the implied guide for the back half in terms of core growth? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, if you stick with the middle of the range for the full year, you would just -- for calcimimetics, both '18 and '19 and then just for the four things we called out in 2018, you get OI that's flattish year-over-year. So, I agree with your math. In terms of what's driving it, I'd call out two things. The biggest one is wage rates versus RPT growth. That is a headwind. We have some offsets to it, but with our biggest cost item growing in the ballpark of 3% and RPT 1% or below, that's a headwind. The other is largely the result of calcimimetics and this gets a little technical. So let me try and explain this. Some of our variable comp is a long-term incentive program. Those targets for next year get set in 2017 and we're accruing against that LTIP payout this year as well as last year. Because of the OI generated by calcimimetics, it's led to a much larger accrual this year than last year, and that creates a headwind in '19 over '18. So that's a second component of what's holding back the OI growth year-over-year. Justin Lake : Okay. That's interesting. I mean, as we think about the back half of the year, the implied guide of flat continuing, does that assume that the labor productivity kind of goes away or remains at the existing levels. Can you give us some color there? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. I'd say, there are two things driving that. One is, there is some reversal on the labor productivity. And second, there is some G&A timing that we think will hit in the second half of the year. That leads to basically again at the middle of the range, a flat second half of the year versus the first half of the year. That again backs out calcimimetics. Justin Lake : Okay. And then if I can just ask one last question on calcimimetics, you gave us the 125 to 150 that is going to go away at some point. So, one, can you give us the slope of the line that you think that's going to kind of go to back to breakeven over the next year or two? I know it didn't go. It doesn't look like it's going into the bundle for next year. So I assume it goes to zero, am I right in thinking that it goes to zero when it goes into the bundle and that'll \u2013 there will just be some smaller spreads next year and how should I think about that? And then, do you want to give us that number on the accrual that should maybe reverse itself in 2020, that maybe offset some of this $125 million to $150 million headwind that you've highlighted to us? Joel Ackerman : No, I wouldn't call that out as a major tailwind next year over this year. I'd call it out as a headwind last year. There's a little bit niche, but it's not something -- it's not of a magnitude that's worth that I'd want to call out. On the calcimimetics slope, first I'd say, there's still uncertainty about how calcimimetics plays out. So, we've given you a range there and it could be above or below that range. The expectation is, Q3 will be higher than Q4 and going into 2020, we're expecting it to be pretty close to zero. Operator : Next is Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : On the organic creeping growth of 2.1%, as you look at your data, a few questions on this one. Number one, has the churn rate from losing live patients changed? Number two, has your acquisition of new patients changed? Or number three, has your mortality of your current patients changed? Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well, let me grab and -- unfortunately didn't write the first one down. On mortality\u2026 Pito Chickering : The churn rate from losing live patients. Javier Rodriguez : Losing live patients? I don't know what that means. Are you saying our patients transferring out of our centers? Pito Chickering : Correct. Has that changed in the last year or two? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. The short answer is, not that we know of. We were not hearing from patients transferring from one center to another. On mortality, the mortality rate had plateaued. And so, what happened was, for an extended period of time in the past, mortality got better year-over-year. So in essence, that helped the growth, but that line has plateaued, it hasn't gotten any better or worse, it's just been very stable. So that impacts growth. Did I get all of your questions or I missed one? Pito Chickering : Yeah. So basically the underperformance is not from losing patients, it's effectively you are gaining new patients slower than you have in the past? Javier Rodriguez : That is correct. Pito Chickering : Okay. On the cost per treatment, besides labor in calcimimetics which you've highlighted, how much did epo pricing have an impact on costs, and I asked because Amgen reported a large decline about 11% due to lower selling prices and they referenced prices continuing to decline through 2019. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. So we're restricted from talking about pricing on our Amgen contract, but we are a very large customer. So, I think you can do some back-of-the-envelope math on pricing. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then a follow-up on that one for commercial pricing, you guys guided to, in January of course pricing was down 1% to up 50 basis points, the commentary on today's call was more positive. Can you provide an updated view of what commercial pricing is now that we're halfway through the year? Joel Ackerman : We're not updating that. We currently expect roughly to continue to be in the range. But you can certainly imply from the comments that we're likely to be at the higher end of it. Pito Chickering : Great. And then last question for me, actually on CapEx. You guys are not changing your CapEx guidance of 800 million to 840 million, [indiscernible] 45% at this point of the year. I guess why are you guys maintaining the CapEx guidance and are you really telling us you can step up CapEx growth in the back half of the year? Joel Ackerman : There's a lot of timing swings that can go into the CapEx from one quarter to the next. So, I wouldn't read too much into the fact that the first half of the year was a bit less than half of our guidance. Operator : Next, we have Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Steve Tanal : So I guess the one thing I'm just trying to foot, the $14 RPT from calcimimetics came down from 16% last quarter, so call it sort of 12% or so down sequentially. I think the TDAPA [ph] reimbursement was down about 4%. So just trying to understand how to bridge those numbers. Is there any change in sort of the utilization rate or the percent of patients who use that so far, utilization being from DaVita versus sort of the percent of the patients using it, is that all pretty stable or what explains that difference? Javier Rodriguez : The patient utilization is relatively stable. There are changes in the move from oral to IV that can impact the number as well. But overall, the OI from calcimimetics, Q1 to Q2, was pretty consistent. Steve Tanal : Got it. And maybe more oral this quarter moving from an intravenous potentially. Is that reasonable? Javier Rodriguez : No. I believe the IV number is up a bit. So, I think we should take this offline, maybe we can help you with your math after the call. Steve Tanal : Got it. Okay. Really helpful. And then, I just wanted to clarify, did you actually say that the calcimimetics cost per treatment should be down in the third quarter? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Steve Tanal : Got it. Okay. That's good to hear. And so then, I guess with the guide being 125 to 150 for the year, it's like about $80 million that have happened in the first half. So, I guess, that would imply TDAPA rates, I guess for 3Q would be down more to bridge that gap. Okay. All right. I think that makes sense. And then, I guess just with TDAPA going to extend in 2020, at least as proposed from CMS, does that sort of suggest that the earnings benefit could potentially continue, or do you guys just think reimbursement is going to come down enough to offset it, is that sort of what you're implying? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. The ASP has this lag relative to the cost coming down, and we expect by 2020, it'll effectively have caught up. The reason why they expanded the TDAPA is because they're trying to calculate what if anything they do to the bundle. And the fact that not all patients get this drug and the fact that the pricing continues to change and the fact that oral is so much cheaper than IV makes that math complicated. So they just said, let's extend the year and do it a plus zero. Steve Tanal : Yeah. Helpful. Okay, great. And Javier, I think you mentioned that you expected ballot initiatives again next year. Can you elaborate on that? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. The short answer is, we don't have any visibility but we know that the union is trying to just throw sand in the gears and make it difficult for us. And so just being that 2020 is the ballot year, we just are calling it out, so we're not surprising anyone. Steve Tanal : Got it. Okay. Perfect. So nothing specific. And then, maybe two more quick ones. So, one is, you acquired, I guess, five international clinics in the quarter. So I guess the question would be, what's your level of interest in doing maybe larger deals or more clinics outside the US at this point? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. I don't think we're going to comment on any large M&A that may or may not be happening in internationally, we continue to look at growing international. We want to do it in a capital efficient way, but we're not going to comment on any specific transactions. Steve Tanal : Okay. That's fair. And just only lastly, I guess bigger picture how are you guys thinking about organic growth in Huawei going forward? Or how would you frame it sort of like from an algorithm perspective, if you do think about it that way, what kind of growth rates you think are reasonable or sustainable over time and how do you get there working RPP versus expenses as such? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Steve, look it's a great question. We're not going to give any long-term guidance on the earnings call today, it's a more appropriate topic for Capital Markets Day. So, hold on a few weeks and we'll address that. Steve Tanal : Okay. That's fair. I'm actually, maybe if I could slip one more in, just thinking about the 2021 ESRD change for Medicare Advantage. It sounds like the MA rates in the market are materially higher than fee-for-service right now. I guess could you help us sort of understand, are they sort of closer to commercial rates than fee-for-service or how does that generally look on average? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. I would say that, we don't like to talk about rates, but just to give you an orientation, they do have a premium to Medicare, but it is way closer to Medicare than it is to commercial rates. Operator : Our next question comes from Whit Mayo, UBS. Whit Mayo : Hey. Thanks. Just maybe a couple of quick ones here. I think Joel, you referenced higher professional fees as one of the drivers pushing your G&A up this quarter. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on that? Joel Ackerman : There is nothing too interesting there that we've got some higher legal fees in there and a couple of other things. But nothing worth calling out. Whit Mayo : Okay. And then maybe just California for a second. The Union initiatives you're flagging that as a headwind, just can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on like, why this is sort of crystallizing your mind more, is it like a definitive headwind? Joel Ackerman : I don't know if it's crystallizing, but rather it's not going away. And so we just know that the unions are very present and they want to be disruptive. And obviously, they were disruptive last year, so we think that it's in their playbook. Whit Mayo : Right. My last question back to MA in 2021, not so much though the reimbursement side, but we're hearing the HMOs talk more about 2020 and they seem to suggest, on one hand, they're not exactly excited about this since they lose money on these patients or their members. But on the other hand, I think presumably, there's a very large premium in these special needs programs, and if they can find the right clinical partners and have alignment that you could really put something interesting together. So I just wanted to hear maybe from your side of the table what you see in terms of the conversations and the collaborations and the potential partnerships over the next year or so with some of the VMA plans. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. Well, you've got your finger right on the pulse, which is people start off a bit nervous and then when we start talking and seeing what we can do with that patient population together, some very constructive and productive conversations usually flow thereafter. So, right now, the regular MA population in the country is in the mid-30s; in dialysis patients, it's somewhere in the mid-20s. And so the first thing they think about is like, oh my gosh, volume expansion, but of course what MA is so good about doing is adding value to patients that actually consume a lot of services and our patients are that very sick and they consume a lot of services. So once we sit down and we explore different methodologies, we're coming up with some win-wins. And so that's the conversations we're having around the country. Whit Mayo : Okay. So do you think we'll be talking about any partnerships? I mean, it seems unlikely from my point of view that if someone really wanted to build out, call it, a special needs plan, how can you ignore a DaVita that has such a significant presence in the market and the ability to really help control and manage the costs. I guess, do you think this translates into some partnerships going -- before we get to 2021? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. It's an interesting way to look at it. I think in general, the big structural advantage that you should think of is that the patients are with us 12 hours a week, and we could do a lot in-center, we could do a lot of coordination. And so, we have a strategic structural advantage, if you will. And so that's one of the things that puts us in the center of it, and that doesn't mean that we have to do everything. So that might open up to some of the things you're talking about and some partnerships with others. But the big -- the big sort of game changer is actually having the patient 12 hours. Operator : Next, we have Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Gary Taylor : I just want to go back to the quarter a little bit. I\u2019m just struggling to understand what was a really good OI number. As Justin talked about, I mean we haven't seen, I think in 20 years, expense down $9. Sequentially, it was bigger than even the first year of 2011 under the bundled payment and it sounds like the -- or the calcimimetics OI contribution was 40 million this quarter. It was 38 million last quarter, so pretty much unchanged but US dialysis OI is up 82 million sequentially and it seems to be so much driven by this expense number in the productivity. So, I mean can you maybe frame that in the historic context a little bit? And when you talk about productivity, did DaVita have markets where you had layoffs or is this just as teammates turned over, you didn't fill those positions. You got some operating leverage and that's why some of that will normalize in the back half. But it just looks like a huge sequential increase in OI of that expense per treatment number. Javier Rodriguez : Gary, I think I might have heard a compliment in there. I'm not sure. Gary Taylor : That is great, yeah, it was great. Javier Rodriguez : No, look, to answer the question, there was no big layoff or anything like that. It was literally amazing operational discipline across the country. And this is one of those things, 2,600 centers with operations just doing great work. And you see the calcimimetics price decrease, we can't take credit for that. They're just new entrants in generics and as someone mentioned on the call, there's other pharmaceuticals that are moving downward as well on some pricing, sometimes utilization. And so it was just a good quarter on that front and we're very proud of it. Joel Ackerman : Yeah, Gary, the only thing I'd add is Q1 was a bit light, and if you think about what's -- how to think about run rate of where we are, our guidance for the back half of the year, as I said before, would imply that Q2 isn't the run rate, but the average of Q1 and Q2 is the run rate. So I think part of the improvement was Q1 was a bit light and Q2 was particularly strong. Gary Taylor : I guess, is there anything you learned in repeatable about this or some of it was just sort of the stars aligned on this productivity and it even surprised your expectations? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. I wouldn't say that there's anything you learn other than a reminder of how diligent you have to be when you go across such a wide system. In addition, the dynamic that we talked about the interlink between productivity and growth is one of the things that we're continuing to debate which is if you run very, very lean and efficient, sometimes you might not have the staffing if that new patients coming to open up a shift or you might not be as agile as you want. And so, sometimes you might actually go too productive and so what we're evaluating is, should you build a little slack in the system and build more labor, and what is the economic trade-off between that and [indiscernible] and how does that all net out? And as you can imagine that depends on the type of insurance of the patient. It depends on whether there's more patients coming to that shift, et cetera, et cetera. And all that assumes that we're in full control of labor sometimes of course someone goes on leave or someone quits and it's a tight labor market. So all those dynamics are in interplay and so we have good productivity and bad [indiscernible] and we're trying to figure out how we feel about the whole thing, but OI was good that quarter. Gary Taylor : Yeah. That's great. Two more quick ones. Joel, last quarter you told us on the calcimimetics benefit, you gave us what it was in the comparable quarter. So, for 2Q of '18, do you have a number, was it still up roughly 20 million year-over-year? Joel Ackerman : I'm trying to do the quick math in my head. It would be up a little bit more than that. I'm thinking about 25 million although someone's going to flash me the exact number year-over-year. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then, my last one, Javier. Before this Trump executive order, was the industry engaged with the administration, or did the administration seek much industry input. I know this very complex, one mandatory, four voluntary sort of set up does not look like the sort of simplistic capitated rate that the industry has advocated for Medicare fee-for-service patients that leads me to think maybe you didn't have a lot of input ahead of time. But, is there any comment you can make on that? Javier Rodriguez : Sure, Gary. We've had a lot of input. We have had many discussions, many meetings. Of course, when you give your opinion, it is just that an opinion and they take it into account, and they listen to all the different constituents. And so, you never know exactly how your opinion is landing or your input is landing. But we did a lot of education for an extended period of time. Joel Ackerman : Gary, I was a few million light on my year-over-year, so calcimimetics was up roughly 28 million year-over-year in Q2. Operator : Next, we have Matthew Gillmor from Baird. Matthew Gillmor : Hey, thanks. I just had a couple of follow-ups. So, for the potential advocacy cost in 2020, if the unions do move forward with the ballot initiative, would it be fair for us to assume that it would drive about $60 million in higher cost, which I think would put you back to 2018 levels or would that number be sort of bigger or smaller? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matthew. The short answer is, it is literally impossible to estimate, but a couple of things to help you think through the variables is what state it's in because media and other things to educate the voters very substantially in price, number one. Number two, the ballot initiative last year was very off balance and weighted in its language. So, therefore, we had to spend more money educating people. So, if the language can be at least more neutral, that would really offset a lot of the cost. And then, of course, well, those are the variables. I'll stop there and then, of course, the number of states would be the last variable. How many fights are you taking on? Matthew Gillmor : And then, maybe on the slowdown in [indiscernible]. Does that have any implications or influence on your commercial mix since it's the new patients that are more likely to have commercial coverage or is it not enough to move the needle from a mix perspective? Javier Rodriguez : I don't think the slowdown in industry growth itself has a material impact on mix. There's the demographic headwind that we've called out in the past, but that really isn't about growth. That's just about the age at which a patient ages into -- or requires renal replacement therapy. Joel Ackerman : Matt, let me make sure, we remind you that last quarter I said that the guidance we gave on mix at JPMorgan was too tight at that plus or minus 5 basis point that it moves up and down more than that. And if you had me guess, we'd probably be down slightly by the end of the year but all that is incorporated in our guidance. Matthew Gillmor : And then, Joel, could you help us out on the interest expense and maybe where that will land with the debt repayment and the refi, just give us some sort of indications of where that would be going forward? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So, obviously it'll come down as the total leverage number comes down. The financing is in process now, so it's hard to predict where ultimately what we will wind up with rates. But we will be more skewed towards bank versus bond as a result of this and that would likely bring the kind of weighted average interest rate down a bit. So lower rate likely combined with a lot less debt. Operator : Next, we have Matt Larew from William Blair. Matt Larew : You mentioned that you are the market leader right now in home dialysis. But sort of if you have a sense for what percentage of new patients entering in the home today you're getting and what percentage of, you mentioned CKD training programs you might be leading, whether that's commensurate with your share on in-center dialysis? Javier Rodriguez : I don't know that number off the top of my head. But what we can tell you is, our aspiration and our goals right now is to have roughly 25% of our patients by 2025, which would mean that we of course would have to really accelerate because it's roughly double what we have now. So we would have to really accelerate the incoming going home. And there are a lot a lot of hurdles on that because it's the way that physicians practice, it is a patient's choice. So there is a lot of things going on in that variable, but what we want to do is be aspirational. And right now, our rough math has that home selection is growing about 4 times what in-center is growing at, but again the total mix is materially lower. Matt Larew : And then, just a question on the capital allocation, obviously, you do have the tender right now, the buyback you just announced, but just in light of some of the deceleration of growth, the lower de novo activity and the rationalization of some of the OUS footprint, how do you think about deploying capital to accelerate top line growth? Javier Rodriguez : So we're always interested in investing in the business and investing in growth. What I hope we've made clear is we need to do that in a capital efficient way. So, we'll continue to invest in de novos that give good returns, we'll continue to do acquisitions that give good returns although those are fewer and far between. We've talked in the past about our willingness to make investments outside of the kidney care industry and we have not given up on that, but we haven't changed our view relative to what we've said over the last few quarters which is our appetite for a multi-billion dollar acquisition is very low. And should -- if we do something there and there's no -- it's not at all a foregone conclusion that we will, it'll be something of a much more limited scale. So that's how we're thinking about deploying capital for growth. Operator : Back in queue, we have Whit Mayo from UBS. Whit Mayo : Hey, I thought somebody might ask this. I don't know if LeAnne is on the call or not, but the CPA regs that are sitting at the OMB, any updated thoughts on the content of that regulation, just wasn't sure if you had a new thought on it. Javier Rodriguez : LeAnne is on the phone. But my understanding -- LeAnne you can jump on is that we don't have any additional information. LeAnne Zumwalt : That's correct. Yeah, we don't have any details. Operator : Thank you. Speakers, we show no further questions in queue. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well, we had a good quarter. We're going to continue to work very hard and we look forward to seeing you all in a couple of weeks in Capital Markets. Have a great day, everyone. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good evening. My name is Debbie, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Gustafson you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you Debbie, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties please refer to our third quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2019 as updated by our quarterly report for Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2019. Our forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim and thank you for joining the call today. And as always, I will start with the clinical highlights to remind us that clinical is at the heart of what we do here at DaVita. As we talked about at Capital Markets, over 50% of our patients begin dialysis treatments through the hospital setting, which is bad for the patients and expensive for the system. We're working hard to lower the number by helping the people better manage their chronic kidney disease through two efforts. First Kidney Smart, which is DaVita's community education program that provides free education on what the kidneys do, diet, medication, and treatment options, including home modalities and transplant. I'm pleased to report that, we have educated over 180,000 people through Kidney Smart and we're making a difference. Based on our tracking, we know that Kidney Smart education individuals who transitioned to ESRD have better clinical outcomes both during and after the transition. Additionally, 32% of Kidney Smart-educated individuals begin dialysis on a home modality, which is almost five times better than the general population. Our other key effort to improve chronic kidney care is our new nephrology-led entity the Nephrology Care Alliance, which will enable nephrologists to come together with DaVita to improve the care coordination for patients. In this model, DaVita will create patient education and predictive analytics while the physicians will contribute clinical expertise to help the patients slow kidney disease progression and start on-home modality. These capabilities are important in both fee-for-service environment and as we continue to grow our value-based care arrangements. We're off to a good start. Two supporting points, first over 500 nephrologists have joined the alliance; and second, Dr. Leslie Wong from the Cleveland Clinic has agreed to join DaVita to lead the way. Next a few comments on our Q3 performance and results. Our adjusted operating income results continue to outperform our original estimates at the beginning of the year, and we have raised our 2019 adjusted operating income guidance for the second time this year. Calcimimetics has contributed to our OI performance, and we have delivered a great outcome. In addition to resulting in positive financial results, our clinical and operational protocols have both improved health outcomes and driven savings to the health care system. While we expect at least one more quarter of positive economics, we continue to expect operating income from calcimimetics to be near breakeven over the long-term. Regarding our financial goal of capital efficient growth our discipline on cost and capital continues with our goal of margin stability. We have delivered strong performance on labor productivity all year, while actively managing our capital expenditures spend down. These efforts have generated strong cash flow a lot of which we have deployed toward share buyback. Now, let me comment on some longer-term issues and developments since our last earnings call. First up California, we're disappointed that Governor Newsom signed AB 290 into law, despite clear evidence of the harm this union-backed legislation will cause for many of our most vulnerable patients in California. Because of the law the American Kidney Fund has made it clear, it will have to cease operation -- operating its patient assistance program in California as of January 2020. To remind you this will leave nearly 4,000 low-income primarily minority patients without financial support that they rely upon to afford health insurance. We along with other kidney care community filed today a legal challenge to AB 290 in federal court in California because we believe it violates the United States constitution. Also in California, we recently learned that the SEIU-UHW has introduced another ballot initiative which could be voted on in November 2020 election. You may recall that in 2018 they sponsored Proposition 8 which was rejected by the majority of California voters. The Union has until April to gather enough signatures to put the proposition on the ballot. We will oppose this new ballot initiative which is simply another attempt to inflict harm on providers, physicians and patients and we believe would add significant unnecessary cost to the system and the taxpayers. Now on to more constructive development, two weeks ago, CMMI released application for 4 voluntary integrated care models for CKD and ESRD. I won't get into the significant detail today, but let me make a few points. These models are nephrologists-centric. The models are complex and we will work to educate the nephrologists to help them evaluate, if these models make sense for their practice. For us the model appeared quite challenging in their current form and they will require significant investments that are unlikely to move the needle on the economics. In partnership with the community, we will continue to share the feedback with the government on ways to improve the model design and quality outcomes for patients.  Finally, it's been a busy 6 months and as many of you heard in capital markets we laid our strategies for long-term success including a new set of financial metrics and goals. I'll be the first to acknowledge that we have more work to do to achieve our longer-term objectives. And yet as I interact with our caregivers, I'm even more confident that we're on a path to improve kidney care for our patients. In closing, we also announced today that Peter Grauer, the Lead Independent Director on our board since 2003 and a member of our Board since 1994 after he took Total Renal Care public, plans to retire from the Board effective at our annual meeting in 2020. After helping to lead the Board through the Chief Executive transition and the sale of DMG, he believes it is now time to step down. We are forever grateful for his tremendous leadership and role in our organization. Now on to Joel, who will provide additional details on the quarter? Joel Ackerman : Thank you, Javier. Let me start by providing our Q3 enterprise results for revenue, adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to DaVita. We generated $2.9 billion of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 2% over Q3, 2018. As a reminder in Q3 2018, DaVita Rx contributed approximately $100 million of revenue. Our adjusted operating income was $462 million resulting in adjusted operating margin of 15.9%, which includes approximately $74 million related to calcimimetics. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to DaVita was $1.53. Now let me walk you through some of the underlying drivers starting with the components of the U.S. dialysis and lab segment. Non-acquired growth for the third quarter was 2.2% effectively flat compared to NAG in the prior two quarters. While we believe, we are starting to see some progress in the leading indicators of NAG, it's too early to give any guidance on the timing or magnitude of potential improvement. Revenue per treatment was down sequentially by $0.56, driven by normal quarterly fluctuations in revenue. We continue to expect RPT for the full year to be in line with our guidance of up 0% to 1% compared to 2018. Combined patient care costs and dialysis and lab segment G&A were up approximately $1 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by higher compensation and benefits costs offset by lower calcimimetics acquisitions costs. Focusing on calcimimetics. We generated operating income from calcimimetics of approximately $74 million this quarter, as ASP remained relatively flat over Q2, while acquisition prices fell significantly. Revenue per treatment and cost per treatment for calcimimetics were $14.54 and $4.87 respectively. For full year 2019, we now expect to generate approximately $220 million in profit from calcimimetics. Now turning to international. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was approximately $1 million including an FX gain of $3 million and excluding an $84 million goodwill impairment to our German operations. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate positive adjusted operating income, excluding goodwill impairments and currency adjustments. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations for the quarter was 27.6%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita for the full year to be between 28.5% and 29.5%. Now on to cash flow. In the third quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $648 million and our newly defined free cash flow was $437 million. DSOs for the U.S. dialysis and lab business declined sequentially by three days to 60 days in Q3 2019 in line with the improvement we forecasted early in 2019 and back to the level it was at this time last year. CapEx for the quarter was $173 million. We are revising full year CapEx guidance down by $60 million to $740 million to $780 million. Two primary factors are driving the change. First, we managed down our spend on de novo clinics; and second, we delayed spend on some self-development projects that will shift into 2020. We expect to see continued progress on reducing CapEx in 2020. Since Capital Markets Day, we purchased an additional 8.9 million shares at an average price of $58.90 per share. As a result of these purchases, we've reduced our share count by approximately 36.9 million shares or 22% since the close of the DMG transaction. I'll conclude with some comments on our guidance range. As Javier referenced, we're increasing our adjusted operating income guidance for the year to $1.74 billion to $1.77 billion which includes our expectation of approximately $220 million of operating income from calcimimetics. We're also increasing our operating cash flow guidance from continuing operations for 2019 to $1.525 billion to $1.675 billion. For 2020 we're planning to give full guidance next quarter. In the interim we are updating the 2020 adjusted EPS guidance we gave at our Capital Markets Day in September. As a reminder, our guidance at Capital Markets Day was $5 to $5.50 per share and excluded any costs associated with ballot initiatives in 2020. At that time, we did not know if there would be any ballot initiatives introduced. Now that we know there is one being proposed, we've decided to incorporate the current estimated cost of opposing the initiative in our adjusted EPS range. Even after adding in this additional cost, we're increasing the range by $0.25 to $5.25 to $5.75 per share. As a reminder, this range incorporates the estimated impact of AB 290. Operator, let's now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Tanal : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. I guess just the first thing to follow-up on, I guess the new guidance for calcimimetics profit for the year implies about I guess $68 million or so in Q4 if we've been tracking this right. And I think the reimbursement for the oral drug is flat sequentially from CMS. So I just want to understand why this contribution would step down sequentially. Is cost going up? Or am I missing something else in that? Joel Ackerman : It's -- there's -- I'd say there's a bit of noise in the system. The reduction -- I wouldn't read anything material into the reduction. Stephen Tanal : Got it, okay. And I guess like kind of thinking through that a little bit further, so the final rule came out on TDAPA and it looks like calcimimetics will go to ASP plus zero for next year. It would seem like you guys are potentially buying better than the market. So I guess like shouldn't this leave room for a profit just given your scale? Or how should we think about that? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, so I would say there certainly might be a little bit of profit. There could be a little bit of loss. There's some noise in the system associated with bad debt that we may not get reimbursed for and some other costs. So I don't think you'll see a big number in either side of zero, but I think zero is a reasonable starting point. Stephen Tanal : Got it, okay. And then last for me I guess on the patient care cost side per treatment was down pretty significantly year-on-year. Wondered if you could flush out some of the bigger drivers there, maybe touch on Epogen costs in that and whether that's still favorable sequentially versus 2Q? Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So year-over-year pharma costs did come down and that is an important driver. Sequentially it's not -- there's very little difference between Q2 and Q3 as it relates to Epo. Jim Gustafson : Debbie, do you have another question? Operator : Yes. The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jim Gustafson : Hey, Kevin. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Hey. So, just wanted to clarify the 2020 guidance change, it wasn't clear to me exactly why you were raising the EPS number. You're including AB, but your is the rest -- what is the rest? Is it that there will be some calcimimetics benefit next -- into the beginning of next year or share repurchase? What was the... Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So Kevin, I think the best way to think about the change in 2020 is a better share count number to some extent offset by the ballot initiative costs. As you would imagine there are a bunch of moving pieces in there, and we're not ready to give 2020 guidance yet. Our budget isn't finished. So there are other moving pieces. But if you want to think about the dominant dynamics, it's share count driving it up offset by ballot initiatives driving it down. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And just to think about how we should be modeling calcimimetics into next year, does that kind of break even? Is that for the full year? Or did it kind of trend down towards breakeven as the year goes on there maybe a benefit at the beginning of the year moving down to zero? Joel Ackerman : It could trend down a bit. It's hard to know. Because of the trajectory of ASP, it's hard to figure out some of the cost issues. But I'd say it's fair to say zero for the full year trending down from a little bit positive at the beginning, potentially a little bit negative towards the end. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then, as far as the volume numbers that you talked about. I think you said that you're -- it's early. You're starting to see some leading indicators of NAG going positive. What are you -- exactly are you looking for when you talk about leading indicators? And what are you seeing that's giving you some optimism? Javier Rodriguez : There's a couple of things that we look at Kevin. But in essence, what we're doing is we're monitoring that the right shifts and the right capacity is going online in our centers and that our admissions execution are -- we're monitoring the demand into our centralized missions and that's looking to stabilize right there. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then maybe last question ifs versus as. It seemed like the big delta in the quarter was calcimimetics and excluding that the quarter was pretty much in line. Is that how you were thinking about it internally? Or how did this quarter come in versus your internal expectations? Joel Ackerman : Kevin, I think that's a reasonably fair way to look at it. There is a little bit of cost relating to LTIP that is elevated as a result of calcimimetics. So, you can think about that in different ways. You could attribute it to calcimimetics. You could say it's noise in the comp line as we always have noise in the comp line, but I think yours is a reasonably good starting point. Kevin Fischbeck : That\u2019s great. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Joel Ackerman : Hello, Justin. Justin Lake : Thanks. Hi. How are you doing? Good evening. So, just wanted to go through a few things here. First, your share repurchase assumptions, so you ended the quarter I think with a little over $1.2 billion. You bought back $250 million, so call it $1 billion, plus cash flow this quarter. I think you typically like to run around $500 million. So should we think about kind of the dry powder that's left $500 million kind of plus whatever free cash flow you generate going forward? Is that a reasonable way to think about it? Joel Ackerman : So, I start thinking about our share buyback philosophy, thinking about our leverage range and our comments about intrinsic value and all that kind of stuff. If your question is narrow, how much excess cash is on the balance sheet right now net of the buybacks that have happened since September 30, I think your math is pretty spot on. Justin Lake : Okay. That's helpful. And then, the ballot initiative, appreciate you kind of putting that in the 2020 numbers. Is it reasonable to think of that spend that you've built in there, in a similar ballpark to the incremental spend you had in 2018 to fight off that ballot initiative? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So, I'll tell you, it's a tough number to predict from where we are right now. That said, I think, that's a reasonable number to start with. As we've kind of played with it, we would say kind of a max of $0.50 a share -- $0.50 of EPS would be the maximum impact that we're looking at right now. But again, it's still pretty early to try and put a definitive range around that. Justin Lake : Okay. And so then, if we just do some simple math, if the business is doing what you expected it to do and to your point you took up the EPS by $0.25 plus offset, let's call it $0.25 to $0.50 of the ballot initiative costs, you basically assume that the share count -- the share count is ending up, let's call it, 10% to 12% better than what you previously expected, just because you're buying the stock materially cheaper. Is that a reasonable kind of bow to put on this package? Joel Ackerman : Is your question, Justin, what are our assumptions today relative to at capital -- to the assumptions we're using at Capital Markets Day? Or are you asking where do we think we'll be relative to today's share count next year? Justin Lake : No. I guess what I'm asking is more the former, right? At the Capital Markets Day your share assumptions got you to $5 to $5.50. Now effectively, they're getting you, if I exclude the ballot initiative, they're getting you more to like $5.50, $5.75 to $6, $6.25. So it's just, you're taking up the -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand the magnitude of the share repurchase improvement relative to what you thought is that entire movement, which is, again, north of 10% of EPS ex ballot? Joel Ackerman : Justin, let's come back to this question in a couple of minutes. There are some heads nodding yes and some heads nodding no. So we'll do some quick math here and I'll come back to you in a couple of minutes. Justin Lake : All right. I'll get back in the queue then. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. If you go over the patient care costs in the quarter, it sounds like calcimimetics moved about $4 sequentially. So excluding that, it's still down $6.20 year-over-year. Epo was part of that. Can you break out how much of that decline came from nursing costs? Joel Ackerman : So you're -- I'm sorry. You're asking year-over-year on -- Pito Chickering : On patient care costs, excluding -- Joel Ackerman : On cost per treatment, just from nursing? Pito, I don't have that number. I don't think we've ever disclosed anything anywhere near that level of granularity. Pito Chickering : So look is it fair to think that if we look at the year-over-year decline in patient care costs, excluding sequentially what are favorable impact from calcimimetics $6.20, is it fair to think that half of that is labor and half of that is areas like drugs like Epo? Or is there any sort of detail you can give us sort of why that would keep on declining so well? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So Pito, I'm thinking about year-over-year. So not in the quarter specifically and I think it year-over-year gives you a cleaner number takes out some of the noise. As we think about patient care costs, our expectations are we'll come inside the guidance range, which is remember up 0.5% to 1%. And if you think about how do we get there, it's comp pressure. So maybe that's what you're asking about and that comp pressure comes largely in the form of wage rate pressure and that's offset by the Epo decline. I mean, there are a bunch of other things going on in there. But at a very high level, I think that's a reasonable way of thinking about it, but year-over-year the cost per treatment is up not down. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. The organic treatment growth looks to have stabilized this quarter. Is there a sense you can talk about sort of possible headwinds you face from facilities hitting max capacity in states like California? Joel Ackerman : So, I mean, we've -- I guess, we've talked about this before in terms of the pressure that can come on admissions growth if you're running labor too efficiently. And you can think about it as max capacity. You can think about it as shifts being full and the pressure to not open a new shift, because of the negative impact that can have on labor productivity. So that's a dynamic that we're keeping a careful eye on. I wouldn't necessarily attribute it to any specific market, but the dynamic you're calling out is certainly one that we're keeping a careful eye on. Pito Chickering : Great. And then last question for me. As there's more and more focus on treating patients at home versus in the center, can you sort of break out what percent of your patients are treated at home and if we're seeing nephrologists begin to sort of change their behavior to get more patients now? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, Pito, this is Javier. The mix is roughly 12% PD and a little below that 2% on HHD. So we're a little below the 14% if you combine the two modalities. The PD is growing at a nice healthy trend and it's similar to what it was before we had the shortage. And so there is clearly an interest in making sure that the patients go to the right modality, but we've seen this in years in the past. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from with Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Hey, Whit. Whit Mayo : Hey, afternoon. So in the final ESRD rule admittedly, I haven't read the whole thing. But was there anything that surprised you with QIP, AKI anything? I know there's this innovative transitional drug add-on change for supplies equipment. Just wasn't sure if that means anything for you? Javier Rodriguez : LeAnne, do you want to comment on that? LeAnne Zumwalt : Sure. First the final rule is very similar almost exactly to the preliminary rule. And so they had teed up that certain medical supplies which will be truly innovative could get some partial incremental reimbursement. So that's positive for sure but it was not a surprise. Does that answer your question? Whit Mayo : I think so. Maybe it would be helpful to explain elaborate a little bit more with maybe an example of how the TDAPA work for this new supply and equipment. I guess I don't fully understand how it works. LeAnne Zumwalt : Well I don't think they gave complete detail. But what I can tell you is that in the final rule they said the equipment or supply must represent an advancement that has substantially improved renal dialysis services. So that's kind of their orientation. There is going to be a process to which these devices will be asked to introduce after 1/1/2020 and it will be the decisions will be made through the FDA marketing authorization. So I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for. I'd be happy to answer specific questions or take it offline with you if you'd like. Whit Mayo : No that's really helpful LeAnne. My other question I just wanted to kind of talk about California for a second. And let's assume that you and the industry the AKF were unsuccessful getting perhaps an injunction filed and we actually see the AKF pull out of the state altogether. What are the other options for patients at this point? I mean presumably you've thought some about this. I'm just sort of curious come January 1 like what ultimately may happen? Javier Rodriguez : Yes it's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out and then of course there are different categories. In some instances the patients will be able to get funding in some other way. And in some instances they're going to lose their coverage. And so we're trying to do math around it and that's why we try to be helpful with the range that we provided and we embedded in our guidance. But the reality is is that we've never been in a situation like this and that's why the range is a bit wide. Whit Mayo : Yes. I mean is there another -- when I'm thinking about other ways to obtain premium support the only thing that comes to mind is tax credits premium support and the exchange marketplaces. Is there any other obvious substitution for premium support? Javier Rodriguez : Not that we are aware of. Of course we are pursuing all options. Some might qualify for Medicare and other things. So that's why the math is a little tricky and again the range is a bit wide. Whit Mayo : Okay. No that's helpful. And maybe two real quick ones. Joel I don't know if you commented on commercial mix. If not can you? And then can we get the actual ending share count on September 30? I don't know if you gave that either. Joel DaVita : Yes. Well we didn't comment on commercial mix. There's not a lot to talk about. Q3 tends to be seasonally a little bit weaker because of Medicare open enrollment but nothing significant. Whit Mayo : Ending share count? Joel DaVita : So the ending share count at the end of Q3 was just under 134 million, 133.9 million. Remember that excludes the shares we bought back since the quarter ended. Whit Mayo : Great. Helpful. Thanks guys. Joel DaVita : I'm sorry. Before the next question, Justin I want to get back to you. It's always hard to compare ranges. But roughly speaking, I think you can think of our share count forecast being down about 10% relative to what we talked about at Capital Markets Day. Operator : And our next question will come from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Javier Rodriguez : Hi, Gary. Gary Taylor : Hey, good afternoon. Just a few quick ones. For the 2020 ballot initiative, did I miss that? Did you size what you thought that would be? Joel Ackerman : Yes Gary, we -- I'd say two ways to think about it. One is using what we spent in 2018 as a potential proxy. The second is we were thinking if you want to think about it on an earnings per share basis, we would say $0.50 impact on 2020 would be at a kind of a max. Gary Taylor : Got you. And will you call that out for us in the quarterlies like you did in 2018 what that spend is in the quarter? Joel Ackerman : I expect we will. I think we'll -- we're trying to develop a pattern of calling out things that are unusual like calcimimetics and the ballot initiatives. So the answer is, yes. I do want to remind everyone on the call that the spend on the ballot initiatives is not tax deductible. So as you're modeling the impact on EPS keep that in mind. Gary Taylor : Just another one. When I look at full year from where we started the year in January, your OI guidance is up $130 million to $200 million. Am I right that calcimimetics started the year at the $80 million OI assumption that's now a $220 million? So the low-end of that is covered by the calcimimetics increase? Joel Ackerman : Yes, so Gary, I don't think we gave a specific calcimimetics number at the beginning of the year. If I were to think about a number for early year calcimimetics, I think your number is a bit high. So if you're trying to say of the OI increase from the beginning of the year, how much of that is the result of calcimimetics. And therefore, what's been the -- what's our thinking about core OI now relative to the beginning of the year, I think it is safe to say that the vast majority of the increase is the result of calcimimetics. Core OI is up a bit, but not a lot. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Last question. I know last quarter we were surprised by the magnitude of labor productivity you had in the quarter. And I know your thoughts at that time were that was going to reverse to some degree. So as I sit here and sort of adjust for the decline in the calcimimetics costs in the quarter et cetera, I mean, it looks like labor productivity wasn't as good as you experienced in the 2Q, but still looks very attractive on a year-over-year basis. Is that the way you're looking at it? Is there anything else -- any other color on those 2Q productivity gains and how they carried into the third quarter? Javier Rodriguez : You're directionally \u2013 sorry, Gary, you're directionally correct on the math that you said. A couple things to call out as well is as our volumes decrease, we did a great job of adjusting and I think we explained the interdependencies between sometimes having labor and volume, and the correlation of managing both of those pieces. So we did go up over 2Q. And we do -- with what we're seeing we expect it to go up even further in Q4, as we're seeing the hiring numbers. And the training costs for the fourth quarter. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks for the questions. I have a couple of follow-ups. You mentioned the impact of the benefit from -- or the impact of LTIP this year, should reverse next year. Is there any kind of number you want to throw out for that that we should kind of keep in mind? Joel Ackerman : Not really. It's relatively small. And I think they're -- it's not something I would call out as a significant headwind or tailwind going from 2019 to 2020. Justin Lake : Okay. And then, obviously, we're now looking out to 2020 and thinking about 2021. First, just for a second, it's just simple to say that 2020 earnings that you've got out there now are depressed by about $0.50 because of the ballot. Is there -- there's no offsetting good guide there to think about such that 2021 there would be effectively a $0.50 tailwind as the ballot initiative costs go away, just because there's no ballots that year? And earnings are automatically $0.50 higher before you kind of think about capital deployment and core growth. Is there any kind of offsets you want to throw out there before we kind of think about that? Joel Ackerman : No. I think the $0.50 is a pretty clean headwind into next year and tailwind into 2021. Justin Lake : That's helpful. And then just a couple of follow-ups, I think Pito, asked about home starts. Clearly, I think, yourselves and others are pushing to accelerate home. So, I think, the number you gave there of 12% and 2%, was your current number. Would it be helpful maybe to share with us the new starts? And how that might have changed over the last couple of years? Or even just the last three to six months as it seems to become a bigger push? Have you seen any kind of meaningful change there? Javier Rodriguez : The reality Justin is, that we had a bit of a disruption with the shortage of supply. So it's hard to connect. But pre-supply shortage, we were running around the same rates, that we are now, which are in the low double digits, so anywhere between 12% -- sorry 10% and 13% on PD. The HHD has been more in the flattish range. So the people that fall out are roughly replaced with the newcomers. Justin Lake : Okay. Javier Rodriguez : Did that answer your question? Justin Lake : So the new starts really isn't any different is your point. Javier Rodriguez : Well, they're different than they were a couple years ago because we had the shortage. And then of course you have to staff up. And you got to tell people that you're ready in. You got to get the market to be confident that you can supply it et cetera. And so, we are actually quite energized by how quickly the market reacted. And how much interest there is. And again, I think with what we said in Capital Markets, it's also not looking like there's going to be transformational but rather evolutionary change. Justin Lake : Got it, and then, Javier you guys put in an 8-K yesterday that kind of talked about your new compensation agreement and it looked pretty unique in that it looks like you're pulling forward about five years of stock comp into one. And so I just wanted to know if there's -- I know in the -- there was a strike price number in that I think in the high-67s before you're in the money on those RSUs. But is there anything else in terms that we should know about in terms of vesting that? Do you have to hit certain hurdle rates? Is that in a proxy I can go dig out, number one? And maybe you could just give us some color on kind of given this is fairly unique from what I've seen in my time, I just love to kind of hear kind of how you thought about this and how the Board thought about it. And I know you ran it by shareholders as well so maybe just spend a minute on that? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Hey, Justin, it's Joel. I'll take this. On the narrow question of vesting, it vest 50% at the end of year three and 50% at the end of year four. There is no performance vesting. I think, the concept here is creating a premium price is effectively what's used to ensure that Javier gets significant value when the shareholders get significant value. And that's really what the Board was trying to create here was an alignment of incentives between the new CEO and the long-term shareholders of the company. And I think there was a lot of support as we went out to talk to shareholders. And I would add this will be put to a vote by the shareholders so all the shareholders would get the opportunity to approve this. So really the guiding principle here was aligning incentives for the new CEO, for the long-term shareholders. And I would -- one other point, I'd highlight is that there is a five-year holding period here. So this isn't about driving the stock price up towards a single or two separate vesting events. Javier has to hold the stock that he gets here for five years. Justin Lake : Thanks for all the color there. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Hey, thanks. At this point, all the questions had been answered. So thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : All right. Thanks to you. Operator : The next question will come from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Joel Ackerman : Hi, John. John Ransom : Hey, guys. Hey, let's pick a point in time a couple years ago where all the payers were mad at you about the exchanges and you had some tough negotiations and let's say, that was the non year. Where are you -- I mean this is a qualitative question, but where are you kind of long-term with some of your key payers? And I know it's always going to be somewhat adversarial just because of the structure of the industry, but what steps are you taking to maybe dial down some of that contention? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, thanks, John. In general I think you've stated we had some issues on understanding what happened with the exchanges in relation to our industry and the economics of the dialysis industry. I've gone on, on a CEO roadshow with several of the largest payers and continue to reach out to many to make sure that; A, they understand the dynamics and the framework that we have and how unique it is. Two, I want to make sure that they're clear that we are very, very into long-term, sort of, value arrangement and that we are open to being creative in a new structure that we are not married to some kind of fee-for-service old structure. That we are confident that we are the best to be the primary care for our patients because of the amount of time they spend with us and all the comorbidities conditions that we can impact and that we can structure something that is both good for the patient, good for the payers, and good for us. And so that's why we're excited to build the capabilities of integrated care. That message is resonating. But as you know it takes two to dance and it's a complicated systems, arrangements, and math to make sure that you get holistic cost across a commercial population, et cetera to establish benchmarks and trends, so they can do good risk arrangement. So, we're up and running. I think the conversations will take years. So, you're not going to wake up one day and say, wow, there was a tectonic shift. I might be wrong in that, but it looks like it will be a slower transition, but the payers are reacting quite well to it. John Ransom : Okay. And yes, it's your fate in life to be between difficult people. So, speaking of difficult people physicians one of the things we hear is this move to home and you guys have said it too is a bit of it is culture and a physician training issue. And you have some markets where you have very little. You have some markets where it's 25%. So, again, qualitative question where are you in your charm initiative with the doctors to get some of them maybe to think a little more about PD as a first alternative versus maybe what some of them might be defaulting to the clinic? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, our physicians are actually quite reasonable in that what they want to do is make sure they do what's right for the patient. And they really worry about what's right for the patient and what's right for the system, and they're very independent in their nature and in their thinking. And so what we have to do is make sure that we put the right science and the right specific and the right analytics, so they could train and encourage the right patients to go home. And once we do that the doctors are quite onboard to do whatever is right for the patient and the system. So, we're working on that. And of course we have thousands of them so it takes some time. And as you said some are more bullish and some would want to wait to see how it plays out. John Ransom : Okay, that's it for me. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, John. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open. Javier Rodriguez : Hi Matt. Matt Larew : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Javier I wanted to follow-up on your comments around some of the CMMI models. You mentioned that they would require significant investment upfront and that maybe not quite like move the needle for you in the near-term. Are there things in particular that you're providing feedback to for CMS things you'd like to see change that would make them more compelling both for you and the -- your nephrologist partners? Javier Rodriguez : We are and the industry is actually very well-aligned including MedPAC. So, there's a lot of comments out there that try to make sure that people understand how these work. If I were to use -- something to be useful for you Matt is they're a little like -- the frameworks are a little like the ESCOs and then more complicated. And so we now have experience on how surprising it is and let's call it difficult to understand how and what you're going to get paid because of benchmark changes and there's little visibility to it. So, imagine adding all that risk but now you have a physician practice instead of a well-capitalized corporation. And so physician practice would have to be out-of-pocket and not know exactly what its cash flows would be. And so that's really an uncomfortable position for a small business. And so we have a lot of more detail, but in general, I think that's a good healthy way to think about it. Matt Larew : Okay. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : We show no further questions in queue at this time. Javier Rodriguez : Well, I want to close out by thanking all of you. We will continue to work hard for you and for our patients. Talk to you next quarter. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filing, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in DaVita and look forward to your questions and comments. I will start with clinical highlights as a reminder of life-sustaining care that we provide to more than 235,000 people. While we discuss clinical outcomes and lowering the total cost of care, our goal is to improve our patient's quality of life. One specific example has been to focus on reducing infections in our patients. DaVita's patient's are prone to infection which can often lead to lengthy hospitalization days and increase in mortality. I\u2019m excited to report their efforts have paid off. In 2019, we reduce the rate of bloodstream infection by 13% and improved the rate of peritonitis by 20% versus the prior year. This is a meaningful improvement that kept many of our patients out of the hospital. Now let me transition to our results and outlook for 2020. We had a strong performance in 2019. We met earnings per share and free cash flow growth target we set for the year. We are committed to achieving our 2020 financial guidance and in fact we are raising our earnings-per-share target range by $0.50. Joe will provide the financial details on both the quarter and our 2020 guidance. Now let me pull up for a few minutes to share our high level views on clinical and on policy. We are in an exciting time for kidney care. We are bridging the transition of care from the nephrologist's office to different types of care. We are working with our payers to use predictive analytics to identify CKD patients with the highest risk of transitioned to ESRD. Once we support these patients, we will work on avoiding or delaying the onset of kidney failure. We remain excited about nephrology care lines, the new physician led entity with nearly 1,100 nephrologists that will be the vehicle to connect DaVita to the nephrologists practice. The goal is simple. Provide world-class analytics and education to help physicians best deploy their time to care for the right person at the right time. For those patients who do transition to ESRD with both a leading education platform to empower patients to choose to start on the right treatment modality or for them. For patients who chose home modality, we continue to invest in our leading home platform where we serve the most home patients of any provider. In 2019, we saw our high -- our highest growth ever in PD modality. We are working to maintain our leadership in the home dialysis with a 2020 goal of achieving double-digit growth in the PD modality. Moving on to policy. We continue our multi-year journey towards integrated care. We are encouraged by the quality improvement that are evident in our demonstration such as the ESCO. We are hopeful that there will be additional models and opportunities to scale integrated care for ESRD patients at national levels. We remain optimistic about the administration's view for value-based care models. We believe that the capabilities that we\u2019ve built will support our collective goal to improve clinical outcomes, while managing total cost. There has been a lot of recent conversation about Medicare advantage and the 21st Century Cures Act. We would remind everyone that Congress pass this legislation with the intent of making additional insurance options available to Medicare eligible patient, ESRD patient. With respect to expectations of adoption, no one really know what choices will be made by the patient. We continue to believe that the selection into MA will be more gradual. We look forward to working with plan partners to manage the care and the cost of these patient. In parallel, our advocacy efforts are focused on ensuring adequate funding in both Medicare fee-for-service and MA. And as we\u2019ve said before, we remain ready and eager to advance integrated care for Medicare fee-for-service population. Shifting to state policy. We will keep advocating for our patients in California and other states where some labor unions are pursuing policies that are not good for patients, costs or the care delivery system. Now let me transfer it on to Joe, so he will provide additional details on the quarter and specific on 2020 guidance. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. Before I begin, I would like to point out that we\u2019ve adjusted the first section of the press release this quarter. We hope this format will give investors easier access to some of the most important results that have historically appeared later in the release. Now I will start with Q4 results and then move to 2020 guidance. We generated $2.9 billion of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 2.75% over Q4 2018. Our operating income was $463 million, which included approximately $67 million in profit related to calcimimetics, resulting in an operating margin of 16%.Earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.86. Now let me take through some of the underlying drivers, starting with the components of the U.S dialysis and lab segment. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 2.1%, relatively flat with the prior two quarters. Revenue per treatment was down sequentially by $1.10, which includes a $1.68 per treatment decrease in revenue attributable to calcimimetics. Excluding calcimimetics, RPT was up by $0.58%. To recap performance for the full-year 2019 versus guidance, to exclude the impact of calcimimetics, we finished at the high-end of our RPT guidance range of 0% to 1%. We sell outside of the very narrow range that we provided on commercial mix and ended 2019 with a year-over-year decrease of approximately 20 basis points. Although this decline did not have a meaningful impact on our revenue per treatment. Combined patient care costs and dialysis and lab segment, G&A expense was down approximately $2 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by lower compensation and benefits costs. Turning to calcimimetics. We generated operating income of approximately $67 million in the fourth quarter and revenue per treatment and cost per treatment of $12.86 and $4.19, respectively. For the full-year, we generated approximately $220 million in operating income as we negotiated significant cost decreases on oral calcimimetics. For 2020, we now expect approximately $40 million to $70 million of operating income from calcimimetics with approximately half of this to be realized in the first quarter as we expect ASP reimbursement to decline in subsequent quarters. With that said, there are still significant uncertainty around this outlook given the complexity in the ASP methodology. Now turning to international. For the quarter, operating income was approximately $2 million including an FX loss of $4 million. For the full-year, we generated positive adjusted operating income of $2 million, excluding goodwill impairments and including an FX loss of $2 million. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations for the quarter was 25.2% and was 27.5% for the full-year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full-year benefited from a decrease in our estimated state tax rate. Now on to cash flow. The full-year 2019 operating cash flow from continuing operations with $2 billion and our free cash flow was $1.1 billion. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow were positively impacted by significant improvements in our DSOs and unusually low cash taxes in 2019. These two factors combined to improve cash flow during the year by approximately $300 million. We do not expect these to recur in 2020. CapEx for the year was $728 million, slightly below the revised guidance range of $740 million to $780 million and well below our initial guidance from the year of $800 million to $840 million. The better results in Q4 was due to the timing of certain project that were pushed into 2020. Since October 1, 2019, we purchased almost 8.7 million shares at an average amount of $64.80 per share. As a result of our recent repurchases, we reduced our share count by approximately 41.3 million shares or 24.8% since the close of the DMG transaction in June 2019. This week we expect to complete our repricing of our $2.7 billion term loan B that will reduce the interest rate on this tranche of debt by 50 basis points. We now expect our debt expense to be approximately $90 million in Q1 2020 and then approximately $85 million per quarter in the subsequent quarters. I will conclude with some comments on our guidance ranges for 2020. We're updating our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.50 per share to $5.75 to $6.25. As a reminder, this includes the expected benefits from calcimimetics as well as the expected cost of ballot initiative in California. Due to the timing of calcimimetics that I mentioned and the expected timing of ballot related costs in the second half of the year, we expect some fluctuations in earnings per share between quarters this year. Our revenue guidance for the year is $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion and our operating income margin guidance is consistent with the target range of 13% to 14% that we talked about at our Capital Markets Day. We expect to generate approximately $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow this year. I will point out that cash flow is inherently subject to greater swing than its operating income due to the time of working capital and other items such as the timing of payroll cycle, tax payments and inter-period changes in the collections of AR. This worked in our favor in 2019 and could swing the other way at some point in the future. Operator, let's now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to go through a couple of moving parts here. First, in terms of the higher EPS range year-over-year. Is it fair to think about it as two-thirds coming from calcimimetics benefit that wasn\u2019t in numbers before. Maybe the rest coming from lower debt costs, or maybe you could tell us any kind of moving part -- other moving parts including California kind of delaying implementation of the legislation out there on the ACAS? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So, Justin, you\u2019ve got the basics right. Calcimimetics is the biggest component of this. And a decrease in the -- in our expected cost for AB 290 plays into this as well. Those are the two big things I'd call out. There are a lot of other moving pieces in here. Our share count moves around as the stock price goes up and a whole bunch of other things related to core OI. But I would say, calcimimetics in the AB 290 are the two big things to call out. Justin Lake : Great. Maybe you can just give us an update on -- is there any change in terms of the sustainability of calcimimetics in your mind beyond 2020, or do you still expect that to migrate down to kind of neutral? And then, do you have a new AB 290 number for us? I think the old one was 25 to 40. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So on calcimimetics, we still expect under the current TDAPA that it will migrate down to zero over the course of 2020. We have been -- we -- as you can see, we've not been able to predict how ASP would come down. The positive numbers for 2020 is the result of ASP not coming down the way we expected it would three months ago. I don't know that our visibility on how the rest of the industry has behaved combined with some of the black box natures of ASP have improved, but we do think this has to get down pretty close to zero by the end of the year. In terms of AB 290, we don't have a new number. Clearly the number will be smaller. That said, there will be some legal costs associated with AB 290 and there certainly is the possibility that it gets implemented towards the end of the year. So the numbers are getting to a size where I don't think it's worth calling out a specific number, but clearly below the 25 to 40. Justin Lake : Okay. Just one last follow-up before I jump back in the queue. The calcimimetics, is it fair to say here that you think costs have come down to a kind of normal range, and we just need to track the ASP and so it falls [ph] to that $4 number kind of [multiple speakers]? Joel Ackerman : Yes, I\u2019m not saying cost couldn\u2019t continue to drift down a little bit, but the real action for 2020 is on the trajectory of ASP. Justin Lake : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Wanted to ask a little bit about this year's guidance kind of in the context of your 2022 guidance, because it looks like you\u2019re kind of there in a lot of your metrics, I guess at the midpoint [indiscernible] for 2% revenue growth per year. So I guess just wanted to understand that jumping point off. Is that still the right point, or are there things in here that now maybe there is a different way to think about the long-term trajectory. And I guess, trying to think about this year's guidance versus the '22 number, I guess the '22 number is going to have a headwind of calcimimetics coming out. And then, I guess your guidance still assumes that AB90 goes into place. Just wanted to make sure that that's one thing we have to figure out if we are trying to [multiple speakers]? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So you're spot on both those factors of calcimimetics coming out of here and AB 290 going into place. In terms of some of the other things I've call out, on the cash flow number, 2019 was surprisingly high and we called out in the script two of the factors, which are the DSOs having come down as well as cash taxes. I'd also note cash flow was helped by calcimimetics as well and the impact that had on OI. So that happened faster than expected. We also benefited to some extent in the year by some of the CapEx we're expecting late in the year getting pushed into 2020. So the 2020 number might get impacted by that to the negative. There is certainly the possibility that at the end of 2020 we will see some push into 2021 and that could flip either way. The one other thing I'd call out is the margins. We spoke about margins of 13% to 14%. We are not changing that view of the world, and so as you think about what the margins could be in 2022, I'd stick with that number. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the preliminary comments on MA. But I guess, it sounds like some of the managed care companies are starting to worry this is going to be an issue for them in into 2021. So I was wondering if you could talk about your conversations that you\u2019re having with your MA companies? Is there pushback on rates or anything that you would kind of highlight there that could impact the or change the impact it's going to have on you over the next few years? Javier Rodriguez : Thanks, Kevin. This is Javier. We've gotten a fair amount of questions on MA. And so I think it's useful to just pull up a little and revisit the origin of it. Number one, this is the only patient population, the ESRD population that was excluded from having the right to pick MA. And so it was fixing a deficiency in the system. Number two, what is our role going forward? And our role is to just make sure that our patients are well informed so they can make the best decision individually. Point number three is everybody is trying to size it and when you try size something like this, there's two variables, of course, one is rate and the other one is volume. And so what we\u2019ve said is that our rate is above Medicare, but substantially below commercial. We are not going to give anymore on that variable. The one that\u2019s most sort of undecided at this juncture is the pickup of the volume and all of you know the same as we do, which is there's a lot of variables at play when individual has the primary insurance, the secondary insurance, do they have Medigap coverage etcetera. So we continue to think that it\u2019s reasonable to think that penetration will reflect the overall market. In addition, many people believe that our patients will have sort of a quick trigger to pick an insurance when there's so many complicated variables and they have many of them been in Medicare for quite some time status quo might just keep going. So we're literally asking how will our patients interpret their benefit, and so we don't know and so many people are continuing to size that it's going to be some kind of an aggressive movement and we continue to think that it'll be more gradual. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess that's definitely helpful. I guess, two thoughts on that. Is there anything that you would think of as you think about that rate differential that you currently get that makes you think that whatever reason it wouldn't be sustainable? I guess, obviously by any standard measure, you just want to bring that delta down over time, but is there any reason why you think that could be the case or -- but maybe you could keep those economics that maybe change the way that you actually contract with managed care, take more risk things like that? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I would think it as an opportunity for us to expand the way we talk to our contract and to our payer providers. It's an exciting time where we're all aligned in trying to make sure that we have integrated care for our patients, and so we're leaning in and trying to see how we can best serve them and be a partner. And if they think that the MA volume is going to be higher than us that might also be an opportunity to contract in that way. So we're excited. Obviously, they want lower rates. We would like higher rates and that dance is never going to change. And then the question is can we all get creative when coming up on a win-win situation. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess to your point about the shift into MA, point well taken that inertia tends to be the way people tend to act when it comes to health insurance, because it's kind of daunting to shift for that, but I would assume that the fact that you\u2019re able to meet with these people three times a [technical difficulty] what the options are would potentially change that dynamic and where we do our analysis in the 20 states where MedSup isn't available for people under 65 in an affordable way, then I would think that adoption will be quite large. The question ends up being so that where in those states where it is available, is there a rationale for those patients to switch from a MedSup plan into an MA plan? And then similarly in a -- for a dual eligible populations, which is 40% of your Medicare book. Is there an incentive for those patients to move? And why would either of those classes see the benefit of an MA plan? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, the first premise that you discussed, which is access to the patient is worth exploring because you might be more talented than us that when you talk to people about their insurance, it's not usually like Netflix or anything. They don't want to keep watching the next episode. People usually start to glaze over a bit and say when you talk about deductibles, when you talk about coinsurance, when you talk about those kind of thing, it is not normal vernacular for most of these folks. And they\u2019ve been on Medicare for some time and it works for them. And so then you got to start to explain that maybe it's more restrictive, maybe they can't see their doctor, but it's got other benefits and you get into it and then you can see that some people just tune out. And so the question is, is it our obligation to go back at them? And the answer I think is no, because you\u2019re satisfied with the insurance. We just have to make sure that you have a new option. And so on all these -- on the dual sometimes that could actually have very little out of pocket and so you might not want to switch that situation. So it is very specific to each individual, but again the net of it is that we think we are not going to look very different than the overall population, but there is the range that we're all playing with. Kevin Fischbeck : And just last question. Is there a time period when you feel like you will know how that shift is going? Will you know during the open enrollment period in Q4, or do you actually have to wait till January for the patient claims actually start coming in under the new payers? Javier Rodriguez : Well, I think we\u2019re going to have to wait till January. We will have some preliminary stuff, but unlikely that we're going to want to predict how that'll play until we see it since it's the first time we're experiencing it. Kevin Fischbeck : Right. Great. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : The next question will come from Pito Chickering. Your line is now open -- with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A few ones here. On the 2020 revenue guidance, what are you guys assuming in terms of organic treatment growth and revenue per treatment? And how does the commercial reimbursement look for 2020? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. So, hey, on NAV we\u2019ve -- we are guiding to 1.5% to 2.5%. In terms of revenue per treatment we are not going to guide to RPT anymore in the level of specificity we have in the past. That said, I think it's safe to say going forward that it'll look similar to what it looked like in the recent past. The same dynamic in terms of commercial RPT, Medicare RPT and mix should play out next year the way they have in the recent two years. The one big change obviously is on Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement. We got that in '19 and we see that continuing forward. So, again, as we think about the how we want to guide and this is consistent with what we\u2019ve raised at Capital Markets Day, more of a focus on margin than on any of the individual inputs. That said, if you think about the inputs of RPT and the subcomponents there as well as cost per treatment and the other things we don't see anything particularly different next year to call out than what we've seen in the recent past. Pito Chickering : Great. And then on the 2020 margin guidance, let me ask this a different way. If we exclude calcimimetics for 2020, the operating income margin is I think 12.5%. If we exclude $47 million of calcimimetics for 2020, it looks as though you\u2019re guiding to about 50 basis points improvement in 2020 versus 2019? First quarter '18 was a very easy comp, so if you exclude calcimimetics for 2019 and 2020, and easy comp of first quarter '19, how should we think about core operating income margin in 2020 versus 2019? Joel Ackerman : Okay. Pito, you lost me there on your math, but I will tell you the way I think about my math and I apologize if this doesn't kick in tight to what you asked, but you can follow with Jim afterwards. So for adjusted normalized numbers, so this excludes calcimimetics, we came in just north of 14% in 2019. We expect that -- and again, we are not guiding to OI. So we -- again, we said that calcimimetics -- at Capital Markets Day we are sticking with that. That said, either through a top-down analysis using revenue and our margin guidance or bottoms up through EPS, you can all do the math and come up with a range. So, I\u2019m going to give some high-level thoughts relative to what\u2019s probably the middle of the range of what you should be thinking about, which should show you a little bit of margin compression in 2020 versus 2019, although still very much in that 13% to 14% range we talked about at Capital Markets Day. And if I have to point out what is driving that, you got a little bit of AB 290 in there. You've got the continued pressure on labor costs associated with the strong environment we are in and we are also looking at making some investments in the form of operating costs, investing in our future around things like home, things like integrated kidney care, things like data and analytics. So if you put those -- all those things together, you would come up with a little bit of margin pressure in 2020 over 2019, but still very much in the range of what we talked about at Capital Markets. Is that helpful? Pito Chickering : Yes, very much. So which actually sort of the last question. At the Analyst Day you talked about capital -- capital growth with CapEx coming down to 615 in 2022. And you sort of -- you just mentioned sort of kidney start home based programs. Can you quantify how many of your centers have separate home treatments options today and how many are freestanding home centers as well? Joel Ackerman : I don\u2019t know the answer to that. Javier Rodriguez : We will follow-up on it. Joel Ackerman : We can follow-up with you on that, Pito. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Mark [ph] with Barclays. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up on the 2020 guidance components given all the moving parts. You raised EPS guidance by $0.50. It sounds like that increase is largely accounted for by the benefit from calcimimetics and the reversal of AB 290. So is it fair to say that the underlying assumptions on share repurchase remain the same given the $2.4 billion of share repurchase you did in 2019 combined with the nice volume of stock price in the last few months? How should we think about the size and cadence of share repurchase in 2020? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. So the fundamentals of our share repurchase philosophy haven\u2019t changed in terms of focusing on intrinsic value and ensuring we are not buying at what we believe -- above what we believe intrinsic value is. Also with the general expectation to stay most of the time -- although not all of the time, within our leverage guidance of 3x to 3.5x, I will take a second here to notes that you'll see the leverage number in the press release is around 3.1, which would bring it in at the low-end of our range. If you think about that excluding calcimimetics, which I think is a better way to think about it, it would put it at the higher end of our range. But with all that said, our philosophy on buybacks has not changed. I think what has changed since we spoke to you in November is the stock is up from the high 50s, low 60s to now in the 80s, and that does impact our share buyback thinking really in two fundamental ways. One is that the dollars we would apply to share buybacks will just buy that many fewer shares because the stock price is up. And second as we think about intrinsic value and comparing that to where the stock is, this -- where the stock is will fundamentally impact how we think about buybacks. So we're going to give you any foresight in what we plan to do. We\u2019ve always shied away from that. But I wanted to give you -- kind of a bit of an update there on how we are thinking about things. Quarter Great. I appreciate the color. And then second question on the home dialysis front. The mandatory model from the executive order was supposed to go into effect last month, and now that\u2019s delayed. Are you hearing anything out of D.C. on why that model got delayed? And does the temporary or even permanent delay of the model impact your strategy that increase home penetration? Javier Rodriguez : No, in general I think the executive order had a lot in it and they asked for comments and the community was very united on its views. And so we are glad that the administration has taken its time because we want a good outcome rather than meeting a deadline. And no to the other question, which is while policy, of course, impact at the end of the day, the patient and the physician pick the modality and that's what's driving the movement to home. People picking it or not picking it as opposed to any policy changes at this juncture. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Tanal : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So I wanted to go back to the 2021 rule change. I guess where I\u2019m struggling with the idea that penetration of ESRD patient should reach the overall market is just this notion that today, I mean, penetration of ESRD patients is 25% for the market at large despite the fact they can't freely enroll in the plan. So wouldn\u2019t that tell us that this patient panel probably prefers MA and that penetration could exceed 35% over time. And I guess I know we are still anchoring to that, but it looks like CMS last week with the changes in the advanced notice for MA rates, took their forecast up to 33 and 21 and then going to 42, 41x22 -- 2024, then 42 thereafter. So obviously a much, much more optimistic outlook than you guys have. So any thoughts on those pieces there? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Steve, I think that all of the opinions are quite reasonable and we don't proclaim to be right. We are all doing it the same data as to economic deductibles, out-of-pocket max, sort of coordination of care network -- narrow networks or broader network. And so when we put all the variables in place, we just think that, in general, we think that it'll take a little bit longer for people to settle in to the choice than others that think that it will be what I call a very efficient and effective market and we of course could be wrong. And so there is that range that it, let's call it the low -- the base case and the high case and we don't have any additional insight that you or CMS doesn't. There's no detail information that we are relying on. Stephen Tanal : Helpful. Okay. And then I just heard you correctly, Joel, in terms of making sure your patients are aware of their options. I imagine that applies to all states, regardless of whether there's guaranteed issue for MedSup or not. Is that correct? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Stephen Tanal : Okay. And then, I guess, I wanted to also ask about another part of that proposed rule to the extent you guys have the time to go through all this, but the network adequacy proposals, there's a few things in there. I won't go through all of them here, but some could be presumably read as maybe mitigating some of the market power and dialysis. How do you guys think about that dynamic, in general? I guess, I'd leave it open-ended there. I don\u2019t want to dissuade any or share, maybe I guess? Joel Ackerman : I appreciate, Steve. Obviously, network adequacy is critical in any disease state. When you are signing up for a product you want to make sure that it got coverage, so that if you end up signing up and then you have ESRD, then you don't end up having some kind of restricted network. And of course it matters whether it's in there or not. The plans have been quite vocal. And from our perspective what we want to do is going back to our conversation earlier is we want to change the dynamics with our payer partners so that they see what we're doing and how we are adding value so that they do want to contract with us in a way that\u2019s a win-win. Stephen Tanal : Perfect. Helpful. And maybe one more on this and then I will yield. Just going back to the treatment deltas, the MA fee-for-service. I guess, I appreciate that you guys don\u2019t want to give a certain difference, but maybe you can comment on how much variability there is in that spread? And what factors dictate his DaVita's willingness to contract for lower versus higher spreads of different MA plans? Javier Rodriguez : Well, I appreciate the question, Steve, but I think you probably know it had low odds being answered. Every plan is steering right now at how they want to contract with us. And actually even if I try to answer it and be helpful, the contract is very specific to each plan and their ability to take risk and our ability to take risk and so it's very specific. And so unfortunately I can't give you more detail on that. Stephen Tanal : That\u2019s fine. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple here on calcimimetics. You\u2019re guiding to $40 million to $70 million of OI this year. 50% of that is falling in the first quarter, which implies about 25% of today's run rate of $220 million in the first quarter. So I\u2019m just curious what you're basing that on? Is that based off of ASP for the quarter today? How much visibility do you have into the first quarter contribution at this point? I guess, this is what I\u2019m asking. Joel Ackerman : We\u2019ve got pretty good visibility with that. The ASP number came out I think in December. Not perfect visibility, but -- so in Q1, we've got that. The trajectory of what that looks like going forward though is where we don't have perfect visibility and we won't know ASP for Q2 for a little while now. Whit Mayo : Okay. So that looks like that\u2019s about a 60% sequential decline of the fourth quarter for ASP, is that right? Javier Rodriguez : Whit, we are \u2026 Whit Mayo : Do you know \u2026 Joel Ackerman : There are other factors that go into that. In terms of the cost decline, the changing mix between Sensipar and Parsabiv and Parsabiv cost differential. So I'm not sure you can get as cleaner number as you'd like from that, but \u2026 Whit Mayo : Is it -- I mean, presumably the ASP numbers available, so can you disclose what it is for the quarter? Joel Ackerman : Yes. It's down a little bit more than 40%. Whit Mayo : Okay. So some other factor would be driving your cost up to lower the OI by 60%? Javier Rodriguez : Well, there is -- there are other factors besides cost because there's a mix issue between the oral and the IV as well. Whit Mayo : Yes, yes, got it. Got it. Okay. That's -- and thinking about the remaining $50 million or -- not $50 million, but the remaining earnings, how do you -- I mean, are we -- how should we think about the progression of that earnings? Is it fall ratably throughout the year? I don\u2019t know, just any help? I mean, I know you\u2019ve about as much visibility into this as we do. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, if you think about it getting cut in half each quarter going forward, that\u2019s a reasonable algorithm to use and then it goes to zero by the end of the year. Whit Mayo : Okay. Javier Rodriguez : Again that\u2019s not a prediction. That's just to help you all with your modeling. Whit Mayo : Yes. Is there a scenario where by the time the industry sort of sees the benefit of calcimimetics zero out that you are still carrying some level of earnings from calcimimetics, given that you\u2019ve presumably been buying below the market for some time? Joel Ackerman : Unlikely just because the numbers get so small in terms of the cost, I think the more interesting question about calcimimetics is ultimately how it gets bundled. Whit Mayo : Bundled, yes. Joel Ackerman : The TDAPA stuff will play out relatively quickly. Whit Mayo : Okay. Just a couple of other quick ones. So just back to the NAG guidance of 1.5 to 2.5 that does implies some level of deceleration. Just Joe maybe any factors influencing your decision to bring the range down? Javier Rodriguez : Let me grab that. This is Javier. We continue to look at the macro ranges and we just think that is the right place to land. We're continuing to invest in our missions, in our IT, in all other operations to simplify patient placement. But at the end of the day, what we are focusing is ensuring that we have the discipline and capital so that we have profitable growth. And so we're not going to chase volume. It's just not the right thing for us. And so we're comfortable with that range of 1.5 to 2.5. Whit Mayo : Okay. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : And just as an FYI, my memory has me right, that is not a change from capital markets. We had at 1.5 to 2.5, but I could be wrong. So let's check that. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Gary Taylor : Hi, good evening. Just a couple of questions left for me. The first, just going back to the question about the ETC, the mandatory demonstration that's been delayed. Do you have any visibility on when that would start? Are you incurring any costs to prepare for it? And I presume since that model had some dialysis center reimbursement cuts, which you could potentially earn back since this is delayed, any potential financial impact is not contemplated in the 2020 guidance? Javier Rodriguez : The short answer is we do not have any more information than any of you. We were given an opportunity just like all providers to give our opinions and insight. And we did and they\u2019re processing that and we have not heard back. We are not incurring any costs right now associated with it. And it was not embedded in our guidance. So right now you're even, Steven, if you will, there's no changes. Gary Taylor : Right. Thanks. My last one to Joel. I just wondered if you would perhaps just review and clarify for us either on an EPS basis or a dollar basis what actually is in 2020 for advocacy costs because I know in the third quarter, you bumped that up $0.50 or, call it, $87 million pre-tax. But that, I think, was on top of what you view as your recurring sort of normal advocacy, But then with the AB 290 delay, maybe some of that costs came back in your direction. So maybe just some help on when we think about the 2020 guide, how much above sort of your -- what you'd call your normal advocacy spend is built into 2020. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So nothing has really changed in that, Gary. There hasn\u2019t been any interplay between 2020 ballot initiative spend and AB 290. They\u2019re pretty independent. So the $0.50 per share is the right number and that's over and above the $30 million baseline that we plan to spend year- in year-out. The one correction I would make to your numbers is, this ballot initiative costs is not tax deductible. So your $87 million pre-tax is overstated because I -- my guess is you got to that calculation assuming this would tax deductible. Gary Taylor : Yes, I recall you told us that, somewhere like $60 million, $65 million range, probably. So \u2026 Joel Ackerman : We are sticking with $0.50 a share. So \u2026 Gary Taylor : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Just figure out one through what's left of my question list here. Do you guys -- so first on the cash available for deployment at your end. I think if my recollection is correct, you guys typically want to run around $500 million at the parent at quarter end. So is to fair to think about you guys have another $500 million give or take of deployable cash at your end is that right? Joel Ackerman : Yes, that\u2019s about right. $500 million is typically what we want to have in the system. So, yes, the $600 million is the number above that. Justin Lake : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Joe you spend time talking about the intrinsic value kind of coming into repo. And given that you did a tremendous amount of repo at really attractive price for the benefit of shareholders, now that the stocks in the 80s, it looks like you are going to little bit less [indiscernible] at those levels. Is there anything we should read into your view of the intrinsic value here at the current price? And how you expect above x-stock? Could you give us a kind of at the moment update? Joel Ackerman : Yes. We are -- we\u2019ve never really been willing to talk about what our views of intrinsic value are at any moment in time, and I don\u2019t expect to deviate from that here. I think the one thing I would point out is intrinsic value is a moving target. It's not something that stays static and its impacted by our results and it can be impacted by our buybacks and everything else. So I think what our views of intrinsic value were six months ago are necessarily the same with our views of intrinsic value today. Javier Rodriguez : One dynamic, Justin, that is rarely talk about publicly also is that we have big blackout periods. And then you have plan and we have restrictions and whatnot and so what you want to do is not look at one quarter or two quarters, but overall what is our track record and I think you see our track record over time it's quite fluid, consistent with what Joe said. Justin Lake : That absolutely makes sense. Thanks. And then just quickly on your commercial mix. Joe, you said it was down 20 basis points year-over-year, but not really immaterial impact on revenue per treatment. Can you just give us some more color on that, given how key that metric is? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Look, not every commercial payer is created equal and if the mix comes from payers with lower rates, it has much less impact on our RPT than a payer who is at an average rate. Justin Lake : And so would you say this is instead of it being just kind of normal aging of the population type of thing, did you proactively kind of walk away for some contrast that were lower priced or was that just kind of the way things fell? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, I would say that, what Joe start off with on an early question still holds, which is there's no new dynamic and sort of the ecosystems/ negotiation is relatively stable. There was no big decision one way or another and it will play out the way it is. Justin Lake : Okay. Just a few couple of others here. One, Joe, just to make sure we understand, you\u2019re not giving OI guidance, but you back to Pito's question on margins, core margins ex kind of moving parts are down a little year-over-year, revenue is up a little bit. So kind of core OI [indiscernible] changes things like that are -- is effectively flat year-over-year within your guidance. Is that a reasonable way to think about it? Joel Ackerman : I\u2019m reluctant to get drawn into the OI guidance question because we're not guiding on OI. That said, I think again you can look at the range is top-down or bottoms up. I would say it's fair to say that at the middle of the range is you should expect some OI growth year-over-year. Justin Lake : At core, like ex moving parts. Joel Ackerman : With margin compression which would say it's not going to grow at the rate of revenue. Justin Lake : Okay. Joel Ackerman : And that's, Justin, yes, that\u2019s core excluding calcimimetics and other stuff -- other noise. Justin Lake : Got it. And then maybe quick commentary, I think you -- the industry was going to run its own ballot initiative in California and then decided to back off that. Is there some reason why you decided to back off or do I have that wrong? Javier Rodriguez : No, you have it right. And I think the right way to think about it, Justin, is very early on you have to explore all your options. And so there's some filing restrictions etcetera. So we were exploring option, making sure that we had everything at our disposal. After evaluating it, we did not think that that was something that we should pursue. It's not in the best interest of our strategy and that\u2019s cleaner to go right after it, literally straight at it as opposed to doing a counter measure. Justin Lake : Okay. Thanks for all the time, guys. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Justin. Operator : The next question will come from Maggie Jiang with Bank of China New York Branch. Your line is now open. Maggie Jiang : Thank you for taking my call. My question here is what is your priority inters of the international expansion? I see that there are about 241 centers in the international as of 2018. Not sure if that number goes up in 2019. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So our priorities for international are similar to our priorities in the U.S., which is capital efficient growth. We continue to see it as a growth business. We continue to deploy capital there in the markets that we see is having the best opportunities and those are opportunities where we can either acquire things at attractive rates or build de novos at attractive rates and where we have an opportunity to add value. So growth in '19 was relatively in line with our expectations. We see 2020 continuing along that path. Maggie Jiang : Okay. And in terms of the long-term growth for the international business, do you expect the -- just because different regions will have different type of reimbursement system, affordability and customers, clientele. So do you -- would you expect the international profitability versus your core in U.S? Javier Rodriguez : I think that will vary very much country by country. As you noted some countries have better reimbursement, others less so. So I think it will be a bit of a mix and where it winds up relative to the U.S will depend a lot on the different mix in the different countries and where we chose to prioritize our investments. So it's hard to predict now what the ultimate margin will be relative to the U.S margin. Maggie Jiang : Okay. And since that the revenue coming from the international is roughly about 4.5%. However, the growth if I just purely look at Q4 2018 versus Q4 2019 the growth from the international revenue is 6.45%. So that seems to be a brighter spot than the aggregate revenue growth around 2.7%. So do you think that you will continue to approach international, particularly in China. However, on the other hand, we do see profit -- net operating loss from international. Javier Rodriguez : So, yes, I do think we are going to continue to invest in international whether it grows faster than the U.S., we are not giving specific guidance on that. Although, I think looking at the past is a reasonable guide to the future there. So, yes. Maggie Jiang : I see. And then in terms of Asia -- footprint in Asia, I see there are a few branches, a few centers in Taiwan and China. And you\u2019re also working with APAC JV. Can you just give me a sense in terms of what\u2019s your business model and how do you approach China or Greater China? Javier Rodriguez : So we generally don't get into too much detail on any individual countries. So I\u2019m going to pass on that one. Maggie Jiang : Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Maggie. Operator : Speakers, there are no questions in queue at this time. Javier Rodriguez : Well, I want to thank you all for investing the time. We look forward to talking to you again. And we are going to do our hardest to deliver on all that we committed. Thank you and talk again soon. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may now begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me remotely today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President. Please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report for the first quarter of 2020 on Form 10-Q, which will be filed today. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim and good afternoon everyone. I hope that you and your families are healthy. Let me begin by expressing my sincere appreciation for the 65,000 nurses, patient care technicians, social workers, dieticians and other caregivers worldwide, including many nonclinical workers who are on the frontlines of care with our physician partners. These people are living up to the meaning of DaVita, which is to give life during this global crisis. Their courage and dedication to helping others is a source of energy and inspiration. I want to extend that gratitude to all healthcare organizations and caregivers around the world. For today's call, I'll discuss three topics, our response to the crisis, the impact of COVID on our business and our decisions relating to the CARES Act. At Capital Market, I talked about the strength of our platform and our ability to provide continued care to dialysis patients across all sites of care from the hospitals, the patients home and in our clinic. Our response to COVID highlights the resilience and the strength of our teammates and demonstrates the power of connecting the multisite platform. Let me give you a few examples to bring it to light. First, we're leveraging our national scale with the resources team and our geographic footprint to open and operate dedicated clinics and treat dialysis patients who are suspected to be COVID positive, which has helped to free up precious hospital resources. The dialysis industry in partnership with the government has joined together to help maintain continued care for dialysis patients by creating isolated COVID capacity that can be accessed by other providers. Next, our position as a national leader in home dialysis to serve our patients well by supporting continued growth of home dialysis during this crisis and helping to provide continued care for all of our patients as they may have moved between dialyzing in home, in hospital or in center due to the virus. In addition, we've been able to utilize our leading telehealth capabilities to allow us to expand the treatment of our patients in the safety of their home, while maintaining access to their care provider team. With the support of the government, we're now using that telehealth platform to provide further support for in-center patient care. Finally, in our over 900 hospitals where we deliver services, we've been able to allocate resources and shift caregivers to areas that most needs to help support patients and our hospital partners. Next, let me address some of the trends we're seeing while covering the expectations for the short and long term business impact of COVID. On the spread of the virus, we're experiencing similar geographic waves of COVID impact, if you've read about in the news. Initially the CDC wanted all COVID positive patients treated in the hospital as its pandemic spread however the CDC quickly recognized this is not possible in terms of providers like DaVita, who\u2019ve been able to focus on infection control well before COVID to alleviate the burden from the hospitals and to treat stable patients in an outpatient setting. Today nearly 70% of the DaVita the patients are either COVID positive or suspected to be COVID positive are treated in one of our outpatient settings. The operational tasks of maintaining treatment three times a week to these COVID positive or suspected to be patient on cohortships[ph] tips and clinic has been nothing short of extraordinary, all while maintaining continued care over 230,000 patients who\u2019ve show no symptoms of the virus, but are at risk with multiple other comorbidities. The near term impact on our business is still dynamic and somewhat uncertain. However, we're able to affirm our guidance for 2020 at this time. This may be in contrast that what you've heard from other providers who are maybe facing volume or liquidity issues due to the significant drop-off on elective procedures. As you know, dialysis is not optional it is life sustaining treatment that our patients need multiple times each week. The long-term is we have less visibility. We believe the economic impact of COVID on our business will lag the impact of the broader economy. The scope of the impact of COVID on our business will be based primarily on the duration of this devastating virus and its impact on unemployment generally. We expect that these factors would have a greatest impact on volume and mix. Volume as the growth of dialysis population is more uncertain due to the potential impact from the virus on the late stage CKD population and on the health status of our existing ESRD patients and our commercial mix, because the insurance mix of our patients could be negatively impacted by weakening of the broader economy. Next, I want to knock the administration swift response in this time of crisis. The administration collaborated with the dialysis industry by modifying certain policies and regulations to facilitate our ability to treat COVID positive patients in cohortships[ph] or clinics, where necessary. The administration also acted quickly by distributing funds to healthcare providers in an effort to ensure that patients uninsured and insured have access to the care they need during this time of crisis. We believe that the spirit and the intent of the government action with the relief fund was to prevent healthcare providers from closing their doors, not to help a company make their earnings targets. DaVita has been and will be able to continue to provide care for our patients, including the uninsured without the need for this federal funding. As a result, although we have incurred costs that fall within the parameters of the relief fund under the CARES Act, DaVita has decided not to accept this government financial support at this time. We believe that it's in the best interest of our company, shareholders and our country to allow these dollars to be redistributed to other individuals, organizations, or healthcare providers that's truly needed. ESG has been an increased focus over the last year and doing the right thing matters. In our opinion, the current healthcare crisis is an opportunity for companies to lead and contribute for the greater good of society and we are happy to do our part. Let me conclude with a comment on the DaVita\u2019s culture. In this crisis, the fact that our frontline caregivers know that they're part is something bigger, the ability has been a key part of our resilience. They are true heroes and they know that our entire company or as we say, our ability is doing what we can to support them. We know we still have an unpredictable future with this virus. We're thankful that we're village strong. Now, on to Joel to provide an update on our Q1 results and to discuss our financial outlook. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. I want to start by thanking all of our teammates who selflessly provide life sustaining dialysis care to our vulnerable patients. I am proud to be a part of this DaVita Village. Q1 was a strong quarter with relatively little impact from COVID. The details are in the press release and I can answer any questions during Q&A. I'll focus my remarks on financial details related to COVID. To start, the level of uncertainty that we face going forward is significantly higher than usual. The factors driving this include the severity and duration of the COVID pandemic, the impact on our patient population resulting in a potential decrease in treatment volumes and the impact on unemployment and commercial health insurance coverage. As a result of this uncertainty, financial outcomes are harder to forecast than usual and the range of possibilities is wider than usual. Our treatment volumes have remained fairly steady so far. For the rest of 2020 we expect volumes will be impacted by any changes in mortality, transplants and/or new patient admits resulting from COVID. On expenses, we're incurring elevated costs as a result of additional compensation and reimbursement for certain of our teammates to help offset some of the personal financial impacts of the crisis, enhancements to our overtime PTO and benefits policies. The creation of dedicated shifts to care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID. Redistribution of teammates, machines and supplies across the country, labor hours needed to clean patients and teammates who enter our clinics, increased purchases and pricing of personal protective equipment for patients and teammates, higher investment and utilization of telehealth and development of educational materials for patients. Offsets to these expenses could include the suspension of sequestration beginning May 1, which we expect to add about $50 million for our revenue of 2020, as well as other cost reductions in our business. At this time, we're maintaining our 2020 guidance ranges for adjusted earnings per share, revenue, operating income, margin and free cash flow, but recognize the increased uncertainty given the rapidly changing dynamics related to COVID. The longer-term impact of COVID is uncertain and difficult to quantify. We believe that the two main factors considered are growth and mix. First on growth, our long-term growth could be impacted by changes in mortality in both the late stage CKD and ESRD populations due to COVID. This will depend primarily on the infection rates, base fatality rate and age and health status of the patients infected. Second, increased unemployment levels will likely lead to fewer patients having commercial insurance which creates earnings headwinds because of the higher reimbursement rates you receive from commercial insurance plans. We can't predict the net impact at this time, but I will highlight four important dynamics. First, when you consider the sensitivity of our business to a recession, we believe that the peak level of unemployment matters more than the shape of the recovery as many of our patients have a preference to retain coverage in the near-term, but maybe slower return to work in a recovery. Second, when estimating the peak unemployment it's important to recognize that a large number of individuals currently included in unemployment numbers are actually furloughed and are still receiving health benefits from employers. Those furloughed patients who eventually return to work may not face any disruptions in coverage. Third, a significant number of our commercially insured patients have coverage that is not tied to their current employment. This includes patients with individual insurance as well as patients on COBRA. This should help mitigate the potential change in our mix relative to the increase in unemployment. Finally, if our patients lose their employer based coverage, they have several coverage options including exchange plan where many patients can access tax credits and cost sharing reductions which is now available that came out of the 2008 recession, COBRA and Medicare and/or Medicaid. Looking at our balance sheet and cash generation, at this time we did not see material near-term negative impact from COVID. Out of an abundance of caution, in March, we drew down $500 million from our revolving credit line, which is reflected on our first quarter ending balance sheet. Given our current cash balance and near-term outlook, we expect to repay the revolver shortly. We also suspended share repurchases in March and have not repurchased any stocks subsequently. In the near-term, we expect to use caution with regards to capital deployment and we'll look to preserve financial flexibility and liquidity in the face of uncertainty. We believe that our cash flow generation and our balance sheet put us in a solid position to weather financial and operational challenges brought on by the current pandemic. This will allow us to continue to focus on what is most important, the health and safety of our teammates and delivering high quality care to our patients. With that operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] All right, speakers, our first question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research, sir? Justin Lake : Good afternoon. I appreciate all the detail, a few things here. One, obviously a really good first quarter, I was hoping that you can kind of walk us through what you saw relative to your own kind of internal expectations there and maybe delineate, what you think core growth was versus kind of any items we should think about? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So let me take that. Hello, Justin. It's Joel here. I'd call out three things, although I would say it was broadly a strong quarter across many dimensions in terms of what stood out. One RPT was a bit higher than expected, although not in a way that would lead me to change any of my views about the full year. Second costs were well-managed very broadly, I'd highlight productivity, pharma, G&A is three things, although there it was a broad strength. And finally international was a strong contributor, part of that was strong fundamental growth, international just had a good quarter, but I would highlight there was about $10 million of foreign exchange gain in our \u2013 from our Asia joint venture that is non-recurring. Justin Lake : That's helpful. So you talked about RPT being a bit higher than expected, but not in a way that change the views on the full year. Was there something that we should think about that benefited the quarter that doesn't reoccur, anything particular? Joel Ackerman : Nothing in particular, the RPT number will bounce around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, so nothing worth highlighting. Justin Lake : And the cost side, I mean, again, like I'm getting \u2013 you guys have a core growth number that you kind of think about X moving parts because I'm getting something into teens. Joel Ackerman : Well, I think it's a tricky quarter, are you thinking Q1-over-Q1? Justin Lake : Yes, year-over-year. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Well, Q1 last year was not a particularly strong quarter and then Q2 came on well, so there was \u2013 I'd say there was some variability there. This year, the typical quarterly seasonality is going to be a little turned on its head usually Q1 is a weak quarter. This year you've got the positive calcimimetics and then in the back half of the year you'll see some negatives from ballot initiatives and as the COVID impact grows. So I think as you think about a full year number that the margin you're calculating there is or where the growth rate you're calculating there is something that I would be hesitant to just focus on. Justin Lake : Okay. And then before I jumped back in the queue, can you can give us that calcimimetics benefit and the \u2013 the impact in the first quarter, maybe both the RPT and to operating income. And then it looks like the number's been caught in the second quarter by CMS. So how should we think about that for the rest of the year? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So I'd say for the full year, I wouldn't change anything we've said about calcimimetics, which is 40 million to 70 million of OI for the full year. The Q1 number was 35 million of OI benefit. The RPT numbers, I'm looking for those \u2013 the RPT number was $9.5 in Q1 and the cost per treatment $4.90 and change, so $9.56 of RPT, $4.94 of cost per treatment. Justin Lake : Thanks for the detail. Operator : Thank you as well, Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Andrew Mok of Barclays, sir Andrew Mok : Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to follow up on the commercial rates, looking back at the last recession, it looks like you commercial revenue mix held up better than your commercial treatment mix. If that's something that could play out again through potentially higher negotiated rates on a lower base of commercial patients, should we see more permanent job losses? Javier Rodriguez : Let me grab that way, Andrew. I think it's difficult to compare, at the end of the last recession of course we had a different dynamic going on. This one is very, very unique. And so we have \u2013number one, as Joel said, we now have the exchanges and so we don't know what's going to happen there and how many people will pick the exchanges. We still have COBRA and then we still have all of these people that have been furloughed. And so when you look at this as opposed to the last recession where we didn't have a whole bunch of people on what appears to be paused or furloughed for a bit, we don't know how that dynamic will play out. Last time there was not a lot of change in the rate dynamic, meaning the rate dynamic stayed similar to what it had been in the past. And I have no information to inform that would change. Did that answer your question? Andrew Mok : Okay, great. And then just a follow-up question \u2013 yes, that's good. Just a follow up question on home dialysis, are you seeing any uptick in interest within your patients to pursue home therapy? And second, longer-term do you think this crisis will potentially accelerate the shift to home dialysis? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. It's an interesting dynamic, many people are asking that same question. For now and again, it is so early in this that we don't know what the long-term implications are, but for now we saw a slight downtick, so little weakness, but then when you look at it, it's the placement of catheters that really impacted it. And then once the administration deemed it essential, that started to pick up. In addition, as we talked about, our platform really matters. Meaning that there's a lot of patients that start in center and then through education go home. Well, we saw that that number went down a bit because we didn't have a lot of educators and nonessential personnel in the centers, so we would not spread the virus. So therefore we had less of our patients in center moved home. And so when you add it all together, there's still a lot of energy, we restart 25,000 patients mark at home and we think that over time we will go back to the patterns that we saw pre-COVID which is roughly 10% or so growth. Andrew Mok : Okay, great. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you, Andrew. Speakers, our next question is from Kevin from Bank of America. Kevin? Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I guess, wanted to ask about the, you guys announced kind of a big hiring push earlier in the year and you guys obviously highlighted a bunch of potential pressures and uncertainty as year goes on, including the impact of the economy. So just trying to understand, what the purpose of that the large increase in hiring was and how you thought about taking on additional costs essentially heading into recession. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, thanks, Kevin. I think when you think of hiring people, you got to put it into two categories. One is the G&A that gets spread out through all the clinics and then you have the frontline caregivers. And so what we announced, which was a big hiring was for frontline caregivers. And so what you're seeing is that sometimes in times like this where you've had a nursing shortage and you've had a robust economy, that it's a great opportunity to have a stable workforce. And so that's what you really saw. We had openings across the country and so we want to fill them now while there's lot of people looking for jobs Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. This is more about kind of backfilling open positions than it was about trying to add to fuel growth in some segment or anything like that? Javier Rodriguez : Correct. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess there's been a lot of press about patients with COVID in the hospital needing more dialysis. Has that impacted your business in any way either by managing the hospital outpatient dialysis clinics themselves or hospitals trying to clear out their dialysis clinics, pushing volume maybe in your direction, has there been any dynamic there? Javier Rodriguez : In general, the short answer is that it is lumpy from geography-to-geography. And so in some geographies where the hospitals because of all the elective procedures have seen big decrease in census or acute have seen that as well if COVID hasn't hit that area. Of course there are other areas where COVID is quite active where we have seen an increase. But when you net it all out, it is nothing that you would notice in the economic model if that's what you're asking. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes, that's perfect. And then you mentioned a number of the headwinds around the recession, any offsets that you can think of? I guess you kind of mentioned labor might be easier to come by in a recession. How do you think about the cost save opportunity versus the potential revenue pressures on recession? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. Joel, you want to grab it? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So yes, I think there are really two ways to think about the cost mitigation and it really comes in two buckets. One is what you would expect to naturally occur in the context of a recession, which could be higher productivity because of lower turnover, lower training costs, other things related to salary, wage and benefit, so that would be one bucket. And then second is the levers we could pull proactively to take costs out of the business, recognizing that if there is mixed pressure, volume pressure that we have things we can do, we've got a resilient business model so there are actions we could take and mitigate some of those pressures as well. So there's a natural component to it and a proactive component as well. Kevin Fischbeck : I mean to reread anything it's the fact that you're going to mention the headwinds without kind of these offsets. Would you expect that during a recession you would grow maybe below the normal range of allied growth or you still relative in that range during the recession? Joel Ackerman : I would say it is too early to tell. There's just so much, we don't know yet about how this recession is likely to play out in terms of what the peak job loss will look like. How much of that is true job loss versus just furloughs, how this will roll forward and how much of we could mitigate when we think about mix. So I would say it's too early to tell how much of that we'd be able to mitigate from a cost standpoint. Kevin Fischbeck : Right. Great. Thanks. Operator : And thank you as well, Kevin. Speakers, our next question is from Whit Mayo of UBS. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Hey, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on Kevin's hospital question. I mean, that's a business that you guys have had some remarkable growth in recent years. I don't think the number of hospitals that you provide coverage has changed, but the revenue associated with those has been double-digits for many years. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about some of the factors driving that and how you contract with hospitals? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. I'll try to give you a little color and see. In general that business is a very tough business, because of the cyclicality, meaning up and down and the demands of the hospitals 24/7. So it is a very hard business to enter. And so this is a place where our platform really shines and the hospital see the value of having the network and having the float pools where you can actually have the team to take care of the patient. So what we've seen is that a lot of hospitals value our value proposition and of course that would be included in the price and the service. And so we've seen that platform grow in a significant way. Whit Mayo : Okay. So I mean, as I look at the number of hospitals and that there's 900 and you're growing revenue, 13%, I mean, is that the way to think about the organic growth of that business? Javier Rodriguez : Joe, can you break down the revenue and the price or is that not something we want to disclose? Joel Ackerman : Sure. Yes. That it's not something we disclose, but Whit, it has been a faster growing business than the core business, although very small and I would add it, it tends to be a lower margin business as well. Whit Mayo : Okay. I had another question on calcimimetics and then a lot of the data's showing a progressive, I think uptick in Parsabiv use over Sensipar and the ASP is much higher versus Sensipar, can you may be refresh us just the economics between the two and what your split is today? Joel Ackerman : I don't think we've broken out that split specifically. As you look at the spike that we've seen in calcimimetics profitability starting in two years ago and then last year and this year, it's driven largely by the oral and the gap as you know between how ASP declines and how our pricing declines. I think as we think about it going-forward, obviously as the tobacco period is coming to an end, the profitability of calcimimetics is going away. I think the important question for us is 2021 and the issue between the oral genetic and the IV is how does the bundling work and how will CMS reimburse us and what is it by drug, by patient or some other methodology. And that's really what will drive the economics. Javier Rodriguez : And a quick reminder on that Whit, that the physicians pick whether it is IV or oral and so at the end of the day they might have a preference, right now there isn't much data and we know that the IV is a lot more expensive. So the physicians are feeling their fiduciary responsibility to do what's clinically equivalent or appears to be clinical equivalent at a much cheaper price. Whit Mayo : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one last one back to just the comments on volumes and trying to think about what the impact of COVID will be on this patient population. And Javier you mentioned, looking at some of the CKD Stage 4 or Stage 5 patients and obviously, there's going to be an impact on your census today, I don't know, maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on kind of how you're thinking about what the longer-term impact can be from COVID-19 on the ESRD population. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. And I'll try to be as helpful as I can Whit, but as you can imagine, there's just a lot of dynamics and it's pretty early in the game. So the first and probably the biggest disclosure is it all depends on the duration and the severity of the virus. And of course if we have another wave and all those sorts of things, but if you assume that there isn't going to be another wave just for the argument and to be an optimist here, you have to start to look at, okay did the virus actually impact CKD patients that would have been on dialysis and if so how much and what magnitude? Two is if you were going to look at something that could increase volumes is, did the virus actually do damage to people that wouldn't have had some kidney damage? And so that is too early to tell. On the other side, of course the preferred kidney replacement therapy would be a transplant. And if you were going to put a transplant into categories, there's the living donors and the deceased donors. And what we're seeing right now while the virus is active is that the living donors are coming down because of the risk of infection. And so there would be some potential changes in those numbers that would increase volume of dialysis patients. So those are some of the gives and takes that are going on, we don't know how it'll all net out and so we're keeping a close eye on it. Whit Mayo : Well, that's helpful. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Whit. Speakers, our next question is from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank, sir. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A few ones here, productivity was strong in the quarter. Can you talk about for these drivers of productivity was it consolidation, including the centers from last year? It sounds like it wasn't a shift to PD or home therapies. So what other factors led to increased productivity? Joel Ackerman : Yes, nothing, nothing specific I would highlight other than, it's obviously labor is our largest cost item it's something we spend a lot of time focusing on and it's just something we need to manage well over the long-term, in order to deal with the fact that our RPT increases are below inflation. So it's just blocking and tackling that we just continue to excel at. Pito Chickering : Okay. From COBRA benefits, have there been any changes to COBRA benefits in terms of the length people could stay on COBRA versus the prior recession? Javier Rodriguez : My understanding is that I don't know of any COBRA expansion, but our patient population can add 11 months because of disability. So there's a disability extension. And so in essence, our patient population could have coverage for 29 months. I do not know if there's a COVID exception. Pito Chickering : Okay. there is a lot of uncertainty, from a macro perspective at this point as we move into 2021 what's the impact that a Medicare Advantage can provide to your patients who are looking to reduce out of pocket costs and can sort of the uncertainty sort of add or fuel more people adopting Medicare Advantage, do you think at this point? Javier Rodriguez : Well, there's a lot of different views on your question and at the end of the day it is just speculation because we don't know. It is a very individual and personal decision. But in general, the reason why people would pick MA is because it has a max out of pocket and it has some additional benefits. And the reason why people would stay in Medicare is because they're used to it. It has basically almost an unlimited network, if you will, which it doesn't have the restrictions. If you have secondary coverage, it really helps you in your out of pocket expenses. And so what we've said in the past and we continue to say is that, we don't have any information that would lead us to conclude anything other than our population would likely mirror that of the general population. The only reason why we are so different is because this is the only population that wasn't allowed to enroll in Medicare Advantage. So the only people that are there are the ones that enrolled pre their kidneys failing. And so there's going to be open enrollment. And now the question is what will be the environment in the fall? Will patients be able to sit with someone? Will they have a website? Will they be more nervous, more fatigue? Is the virus still with us or are we in a more normal situation? And the short answer is we don't know any of that. So I'm just giving you the data of how someone would pick one versus another. Pito Chickering : Great. And then, so last question here just from a modeling perspective you'd walk through a bunch of costs, which we'll roll through for 2Q. Is there any way that there's some dollar value they can add to how much we should be thinking about these new cost being layered in during 2Q. Thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So Pito, it is really tough to predict if there are a lot of moving pieces and again, the uncertainty around length and severity of the pandemic, et cetera, et cetera. I would also note that as we think about how we've modeled things in the various scenarios we played with, we've generally assumed that we're past the peak. We're kind of at or past the peak. We've got a whole bunch of \u2013 a whole range around at what pace the pandemic begins to taper. But we haven't modeled DNA a second wave. So, just as you think about our guidance and what we're comfortable with, I just wanted to point that out. In terms of specific numbers, we are thinking the number for April will be somewhere in the $30 million to $40 million range. I think it's reasonable to expect May will be in the same range. And then again, depending on how the pandemic plays out, we'd expect it to start tapering down. Pito Chickering : Okay. And actually the last one, I apologize on, share repurchases. Like you're not taking any of the government granted at this point and because your point, you're viewing this as sort of past the peak at this point, when do you think that, that you will consider doing share repurchases again, it's just more of a third quarter event or if you guys walk into June and things are better, we guys began buying shares back at that point. Thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So I can't give you a date, because we don't have one. We are certainly going to be cautious with capital deployment. Given all the uncertainty. I think we're likely to keep a higher level of liquidity than we have in the past. So hard to say when \u2013 how we're going to think about share repurchases going forward and when some of that caution might relax. Pito Chickering : Great. Alright. Thanks so much guys. Great quarter. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And thank you as well, Pito. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary? Gary Taylor : Hi. Good afternoon. Just a few. Just to clarify on your last response, Joel, when you said $30 million to $40 million and \u2013 was that for April and May was that additional expense that you were additional operating expense you were just saying is it's plausible? Joel Ackerman : Yes, that would be the incremental operating expense that we would expect related to COVID. Gary Taylor : Thank you. And the decision to return the CARES Act funding, is that decision limit to the first 50 billion that's been distributed. Have you made a determination about the full 175 billion between the two provider funds? Or is that sort of TBD depending on how things would develop? Javier Rodriguez : I might be getting lost in the details of, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here Joel, because I might be aggregating pools that I\u2019m not, but the CARES Act relief fund is how I have it in my head. And those are the funds that we decided were the intention of the government, which everybody can interpret in different ways. But from our perspective, they were a safety net. And they were to be used for people that needed that money, because the economic damage was so severe that they can keep their doors open. And so while it\u2019s you can tell from the numbers that that Joel gave you, we have big expense increases. And by the way, the numbers that you cited there the $30 million, $40 million is monthly. So we have had big expenses. We don\u2019t think that that was the intention of money, so we\u2019re going to get that back. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then I saw just a couple numbers flip in the income statement. Joel, I wonder if you would comment on, I know the equity investment income was almost $18 million this quarter, higher than usual than the other income down by interest expense flipped to a negative $4 million in change, both those looked a little unusual, anything to pull out on those? Joel Ackerman : Yes. On the equity income, the biggest component of that is the $10 million of FX on the Asia joint venture that I called out. There is another component to this that relates to the deconsolidation of a few of our clinics, starting 1/1/2020, that the details of this will be in the 10-Q. It\u2019s got no impact on EPS, but it does take what was OI and turns it into \u2013 it turns it, it moves it into equity income. It used to flow through revenue and costs and it moves it into equity income and then there\u2019s an offset down at the NCI level. So those are the big things I call out there. On the other income, there was a different FX loss associated with the international business that was about $9 million. So those are the big things I call out. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : And thank you as well, Gary. Our next question is from Matt of William Blair. Sir? Matt Larew : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Actually have you, I just want to ask one more time on the CARES dollars. Obviously you\u2019ve announced the receipt of the grant dollars, I think it was April 13, had said you were contemplating keeping it. Just curious, was there additional guidance or regulation from the government that influenced your decision or was this a proactive decision by the Board and management, just trying to understand from April 13 to today. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. It was the ladder, which is a proactive decision by the Board and management. And again you could make a very good case to say the spirit of that was to reimburse high expenses related to COVID, which we have many including PT, additional labor overtime and all of the things that we\u2019ve described on the call. We came on the other side, which is the government, which needs to be totally commended. Just said, we\u2019ve never had anything like this. And so we\u2019re going to distribute money to make sure that the wellbeing of Americans has taken care of. And then we\u2019ll reconcile. Well, we don\u2019t need time to reconcile. We know that we are not in that spot where we\u2019re the safety net. And so we want to be proactive. So the government gets visibility. Those people that can give them money back and that money can be redeployed as soon as possible to the people that really need it. So it\u2019s really about the spirit, than we made the decision. Matt Larew : Yes, fair enough. Thanks, Javier. And then actually just you\u2019re not enough this morning about DaVita Venture and just curious what if any targets you might have for that group and just sort of giving you an answer this morning, wanting to give you an opportunity to comment on it. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thank you, Matt. We\u2019re really excited about DaVita Venture, and basically we have a lot of entrepreneurs that are coming out with all kinds of great things. And they\u2019re saying, can we partner with you? And so this Venture Group is out there and now really generating demand. And so we want to be the partner of choice. And as we talked about capital markets we\u2019re expanding from being a dialysis company to being a full kidney care company and that means that we\u2019re going to need certain technologies and partners from diagnostic to pharmaceuticals to other areas in transplant. And so we want to be out there and we\u2019re really excited about it. Joel Ackerman : The only thing I\u2019d add in there is, as you think about the magnitude of these investments, we\u2019re thinking these are likely to be single digit millions. And if you think about it in the context of our free cash flow, it\u2019s not going to change the number at all, so relatively small. Matt Larew : Okay. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Matt. Our next question is from Lisa Clive of Bernstein. Ma\u2019am? Lisa Clive : Hi. Just a question on legislation in Washington, clearly, D.C. is busy with COVID-19 and that\u2019s main focus. But do you think the COVID-19 pandemic makes it more likely that the patient\u2019s act could get passed? Do you have any comments in sort of how live that bill is in Washington today? And follow-up question on COBRA, my understanding is even though there isn\u2019t 11 month disability extension, almost all patients drop out of COBRA at 18 months, because after that point they go from the paying 102% of the premium to 150%. So is it fair to assume that the only ones who stay on COBRA are the ones that have big CAF premium support? Javier Rodriguez : Let me grab them. Lisa, first of all, you\u2019ve exceeded my knowledge of COBRA. And Joel, I don\u2019t know if you know that technical piece. Lisa Clive : I guess the other way of asking it, because\u2026 Joel Ackerman : I do not has the answer. Lisa Clive : Okay. I guess, the other way of asking it, because if we do given the unemployment numbers that we\u2019ve been seeing across the country, if COBRA becomes a much bigger part of your \u2013 well, it\u2019s a lot more patients end up on COBRA. I\u2019m just trying to understand, how long they actually will end up on it. So if you do have any insights into that, that would be helpful. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, I do not. And so \u2013 but we could get back to you, but I do not have any more insights on that. Sorry. But you had a second part of your question, Lisa. Lisa Clive : On the patients act, given just whether the COVID-19 has any impact and also just general discussions in Washington around that. Javier Rodriguez : Well, I\u2019ll just say in general, I have not had the courage to ask anything, because obviously, all hands have been on deck for this COVID crisis. I\u2019m hopeful that policy makers will see the value of integrated care and that they will see the power of connecting the sites of care and having this organized fashion really helped, because if you look at DaVita as an example, and how we were organized with PPE and how we were able to stand up cohorting centers. How we were able to take care of our teammates with childcare and other things. We obviously saw that in other areas, but we did not see that in a lot of the smaller players. And so we\u2019re hopeful that the government sees the resource organization and capabilities around the country is also quite useful. And if you connect the sites of care and the technology that could benefit the system and the patients. So we will see post-COVID. Lisa Clive : Okay, great. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Lisa. Our next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Sir? Justin Lake : Thanks for letting me jump back in. I\u2019ve got a few more here. First I just wanted to follow-up, Joel, to your answer to Peter\u2019s question on our costs. I understand you don\u2019t want to give a specific number. But in your prepared remarks you kind of walked through, there were costs associated with COVID and you gave us not insignificant new costs in April and May. You talked about the $50 million benefit from sequestration and then you also mentioned other cost reductions. So I\u2019m curious as you bundle those together, it looks like it\u2019s a headwind x potentially other cost reductions. But I\u2019m just trying to think about relative to where you were kind of in February when you gave the original guide or updated it. How should we think about the net of those impacts? Is that an additional headwind in your mind or can you kind of offset the incremental costs from COVID? Javier Rodriguez : So the way I\u2019m thinking about it is, if you start with a strong performance in the core in Q1 and you offset that with the COVID costs and then add back sequestration, we kind of feel like \u2013 and then there are some natural costs that come down. T&E is a simple example of that. We feel like net-net, we wind up with a potential headwind that we\u2019re comfortable absorbing in without changing our guidance. So if you want to think about how do we get to maintaining our guidance, strong Q1 the negative of COVID offset by the $50-ish million from the sequestration suspension and some other cost offsets. Justin Lake : And can I pin you down in terms of how much better Q1 was versus your internal expectations when you set the guide for the year? Javier Rodriguez : No, you cannot pin me down on that. Justin Lake : Okay. Then in your 10-Q that you just filed, there were a couple of new investigation subpoenas that were out there. I know this is the cost of doing business in dialysis and historically for 20 years of income in the company, they really amounted to much. But just wanted to ask you if there was anything new or different that we should add \u2013 that we should consider in what those \u2013 and what got reported there, I guess in New Jersey and California? Javier Rodriguez : No. What I would add is, of course we taken very, very seriously. And we have just been through our corporate integrity agreement. We\u2019ve been on it for five years and we continue to want to lead and show the spirit of compliance and the law of compliance. And so we\u2019re disappointed every time we get them. And of course, they can come through many different ways, including investigations, inquiries. And you hope that once they see what we\u2019re doing that they\u2019re satisfied with that. But every time we get them I can tell you personally, I am very, very frustrated because we talk and live compliance on a daily basis. So nothing else to add to that, Justin. Justin Lake : Understood. And then just a couple of numbers questions here. You mentioned that a significant portion of your commercial patients have coverage that\u2019s not tied to employment. I\u2019m just curious if you could share, even just a round number there, is it half a quarter, two-thirds, anything like that you can tell us? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, so there are really two components to that. There\u2019s COBRA and patients who are on the exchanges, the numbers in the kind of 25% to 30%, I believe. Justin Lake : Okay. So 25% to 30% are tied to employment? Javier Rodriguez : Right. Justin Lake : Or tied to COBRA and exchanges, okay. And then the first quarter, what would you say the \u2013 or can you give us a number in terms of what you think the benefit was of the extra day in the quarter for the operating results? Javier Rodriguez : No, hold on, I\u2019ll get you that number before we hang up. Justin Lake : Okay. And then just \u2013 and then California AB 290, I know you talked about that being lower than previous, like the 25% to 40% you originally gave, it\u2019s going to be lower. Should we think about that just be going to zero now or do you think there still could be an impact there? Javier Rodriguez : As opposed to give you a number, I think what I can tell you is that due to COVID, the injunction stayed and so basically what that means in late terms is, there\u2019s an extension of the case. And so unlikely to have much of an impact unless, because of the timing until the fourth quarter, depending how the case goes and then am I going to Q1 of 2021. So the number\u2019s still the same. The timing has shifted and of course the outcome is unknown. Justin Lake : Okay. And last one, payer mix in the quarter, Javier, I think you said was down. Can you give us any specificity there or what you kind of ended the quarter with in terms of commercial mix? Javier Rodriguez : I believe, we published it. So I can say it, right, Joel? Joel Ackerman : I believe that is not correct. Just it \u2013 there was nothing significant in the movement for the quarter. We'll call it out on the quarterly basis, if we think it's important, but there was nothing important there. Justin Lake : So still in the 10% range, give or take. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Justin Lake : Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate all the questions. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Thank you, Justin. Our next question is from Jeff Gates of Gates Capital Management. Sir? Jeff Gates : Yes, a couple of questions. First, I noticed the volume was the best volume quarter you've had in a few quarters. And I'm just wondering if there's, you see any signs of an uptick in volume and what might be driving that number one? And number two, is this environment going to force you to do less to know those or you won't be able to do as many de novos. So will your capital budget come down at all? Javier Rodriguez : You want to grab, Joel. Joel Ackerman : Yes, sure. We had a reasonable NAG quarter, no doubt. I wouldn't call out anything specific yet. I don't \u2013 I wouldn't say we're ready to declare victory on some of the efforts we've been undertaking to drive NAG back up. And there certainly was a tiny bit of noise at the end of the quarter. So nothing to call out there. In terms of de novos, I think we're going to wait and see what happens to the industry volumes and what happens on the home side. But I think there is certainly a possibility that is, if there is an overall NAG headwind that comes out of COVID and possibly in accelerated shift to home, that I think you would see a potential decline not just in our de novos, but in industry de novos and that would bring the capital budget down. Jeff Gates : So you're not having any trouble constructing centers that you have planned? Joel Ackerman : Well, I'd say for 2020, depending on how long the various states shut down lasts, we might see our capital spend come down a bit there. Just some projects that we physically can't get done right now, but that'll depend on how long things last. Javier Rodriguez : Just in well, let me finish up by saying that the impact of one day is somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range. Jeff, any other questions? Operator : Thank you Jeff. And yes speakers, we don't have any questions on queue as of now. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well let me wrap up with a couple of closing remarks. Number one, thank you for all the support. Number two, I don't know if I can convey in words how proud I am of our team. The beauty and the dedication that I've seen over the last 60 days is just literally hard to put into words. The fact that our government and our competitors and us put everything aside and co-hearted and work together to take care of our patients. It's just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. The clinical focus and the infection control expertise that we have has been critical in helping us do this virus. Point three, our platform, the importance of the platform in connecting the sites of care has been highlighted through this crisis. The resilience of our team and our business model has been beautiful, beautiful, beautiful financially, strong balance sheet and a proven track record of cost management. And lastly, I do think that philosophically it is time to come together as a country and we are happy to do our part. So thank you for your interest in our company and we'll talk again next quarter. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes DaVita\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for participating and have a great day.",

I'll now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter financial results. First I want to start as I did last quarter by acknowledging and thanking all of our teammates, especially the thousands of clinicians who provide our patients with life-sustaining care each and every day. The past several months have been amongst the finest and most exceptional chapters in our history, reflecting the compassion and the dedication of our teammates. The company's strong performance this quarter demonstrates the benefits of our patient-centric, comprehensive kidney care platform, beginning with CKD all the way through ESRD and transplant. The continuity of care that we offer our patients allow us to meet the patient where they are through offering modality options in the hospital, in the patient's home or in the dialysis center. We're now nearly six months into this pandemic. And if you were to walk into one of our centers, you still would experience a high level of energy and intensity amongst our teammates as they provide for the health and safety of our patients. We have supplemented our effective infection control policies by conducting COVID test for patients and teammates both within our lab, as well as with special partnerships with external labs. These physician and clinician-led efforts have enabled us to maximize the number of patients treated outside of the hospital, which of course is good for patients and has helped reduce the burden on hospitals. While we cannot know for certainty what lies ahead, I can say that we feel prepared to continue our work to keep our patients and our teammates safe. We had a strong financial second quarter. As a result, we're raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year by $0.50 to $6.25 to $6.75. Our strong operational performance came despite investments and expenses we incurred in response to COVID offset by savings associated with COVID in the form of reduced travel and health benefit expenses amongst other items, which Joel will explain in more detail. Today, I'd like to cover four additional items. Let me start off by talking about treatment volumes and commercial mix, two of the largest uncertainties associated with the pandemic that we identified last quarter. Our patient census has been negatively impacted primarily by COVID related deaths delayed-by-patient starts on dialysis and we expect our treatment volumes for the remainder of the year to fall below the low end of the range of 1.5% to 2.5% provided in September. The patients that unfortunately passed away due to COVID were primarily among our older population, and therefore, were more frequently covered by government insurance. As a result thus far, we have not seen a material negative impact on our commercial mix, although with only three months of actual data on job losses, any assessment of our commercial patient population and their ability to access private versus government health insurance are preliminary. What we do know is that our private pay census fared better than expected in the quarter as our patients worked hard to maintain their employment and their insurance coverage. While the long-term impact of COVID remain uncertain, some natural offset exist and we believe in the resiliency of our business model. For the second topic, I'd like to share some exciting developments in our home business. As you know, we start from a leadership position in home with approximately 14% of our patient population on home modality and more than 25% utilizing a home modality at some point during their care journey. Our home growth continues to outpace our in-center dialysis growth by more than five times and during this pandemic we've seen a slight uptick in interest from patients wanting to dialyze at home. We now have over 28,000 home patients, who received training, education, lab drug and medication at over 1,750 programs across the United States. In fact, 95% of dialysis patients live within 30 miles of a DaVita home program. The scale of our home business is the result of many years of investment that we have made in capabilities, education and technology to help give patients and physicians the option to choose from dialysis, if it is right for them. Let me provide a couple of examples. First, several years ago, we launched our home remote monitoring platform, which enables daily monitoring of vitals for approximately 5,000 of our high-risk patients. In addition, early last year, we released a robust home telehealth platform, which now has a user base of over 19,000 patients. More recently, we've continued building out these platforms to provide patient support features like virtual disease management program, virtual patient support groups and capabilities that promote continuity of care and support return home therapy for hospitalized patients. We believe that these capabilities have allowed us to significantly increase the frequency of home patient touches to continue to enhance the quality of care and to help extend the amount of time home patients spend on the therapy. In fact that we already had telehealth in place, has also served as a significant advantage in our ability to keep these patients and their caregivers connected during the pandemic. A second example we're excited about is the launch of our Artificial Intelligence system that helps identify PD patients that maybe at risk for hospitalization, which is one of the largest causes of home patients switching to in-center dialysis. Home growth and innovation continue to be amongst my top priorities. And we continue to pilot many new programs and ideas around the country to help support patients for whom home dialysis is the best modality. We also believe that our full suite of modality offerings enable us to help patients seamlessly access the right modality at the right time in their dialysis journeys. Our patients can continue to benefit from our national footprint, our physician partnerships and our unique capabilities as we seek to lead the industry in growing home. My third topic is calcimimetic. As many of you know, we're now moving into the next phase of calcimimetic reimbursement as CMS proposed including calcimimetic in the Medicare bundle payment in the recently issued proposed payment rule for 2021. We believe that the TDAPA period gave CMS sufficient time to observe utilization and pricing data, especially in the light of the mix of IV therapy and oral therapy. Over the last couple of years, our physicians and our clinical teams developed patient-centric protocols to achieve our high-quality standards for care, which in this instance also drove down the cost for healthcare system, because the protocol resulted in a higher mix of low-cost generic drugs and a lower mix of higher cost IV alternative. We believe that the new rule will result in similar economics for calcimimetics in 2021 as we have guided in 2020 which will help to offset the underfunding of the remaining Medicare bundle. My last topic is Medicare Advantage. As many of you are aware in 2016, Congress enacted the 21st Century CARES Act to provide all Medicare eligible patients with the option to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans, including all ESRD patients. We believe that the ending of the barriers that have prevented active dialysis patients from enrolling in Medicare Advantage will be a positive development for many patients, providers and managed care organizations as this new rule will expand the opportunity to provide coordinated care to patients who suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Unfortunately, CMS' recent ruling that loosen MA network adequacy requirements for only dialysis services, calls into question the breadth of the choices available to dialysis patients. There are many factors that will shape the eventual enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans. And although we have no clear visibility we do continue to believe that enrollment in MA plans by ESRD patients will be gradual over the coming year. Now, I'll pass it on to Joel to provide an update on our Q2 results and to discuss our financial outlook. Joel Ackerman : Thanks Javier. We had a strong quarter, despite the net headwind from our COVID response, primarily as a result of improved adjusted margins in our core Kidney Care business. Here are some specifics. Our non-acquired treatment growth slowed from 2.3% in Q1 to 1.6% in Q2. We believe the primary drivers of this decrease were COVID-related, as increased mortality and lower new patient starts were partially offset by a nationwide decrease in kidney transplants and lower missed treatments. We expect this net COVID NAG headwind to persist at least until this time next year. Total revenue was in line with our expectations as a result of lower volumes offset by higher revenue per treatment. RPT was up due to normal seasonality in co-insurance and deductibles and the temporary Medicare sequestration release, partially offset by lower calcimimetics revenue. As Javier said, while the long-term impacts of COVID remain uncertain, we did not see any net impact on our commercial mix quarter-over-quarter. There are a number of factors that we believe underlie this dynamic including among other things the job loss rate for our commercial patient population was lower than the national unemployment rate. Many of our commercial patients who were initially furloughed have since returned to work or expect to return to work. And finally we believe that our patients who were laid off have been enrolling in other commercial insurance such as COBRA and exchange plans at a higher rate than we have seen in the past. Adjusted operating income margin was strong for the quarter at 16%. On a year-over-year basis our margin expanded due to strong cost management across the P&L and an improvement in RPT. Calcimimetics contributed approximately $19 million to our operating income in the second quarter. Now let me give you some details about the impact of COVID on our financial results. For Q2 we estimate that we incurred expenses and other negative impacts on our operating income of approximately $85 million. Incremental compensation and benefits to our teammates was the largest contributor to these costs. Offsets in the quarter to the $85 million include among other things, decreased travel, lower health benefits expenses and lower facility and training costs. We also had the benefit of the temporary halt on Medicare sequestration that started in May. As a result of these offsets, we estimate that the net impact of COVID on our operating income for the quarter was between $20 million and $30 million. Looking forward to the second half of 2020, the impact of COVID is hard to forecast given the uncertainty and the progress of the virus and the economic impact. While extreme situations could occur that are beyond our range, we have incorporated a wide range of scenarios in our updated guidance including scenarios in which the net financial impact of COVID-19 in each of Q3 and Q4 could be similar to what we experienced in Q2. Let me next turn to our 2020 guidance. Given the strength of our first half performance, we are updating our guidance ranges. We are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range by $0.50 from $6.25 to $6.75. We are raising the guidance range for adjusted operating income margin to 14% to 14.75%. We're increasing our cash flow guidance $800 million to $1 billion, an increase of $200 million over our previous guidance range. We are maintaining our guidance range for revenue of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion but we now expect to be below the midpoint of the range due to the anticipated slowdown in volume growth. On capital expenditures, we provided an estimated range of $700 million to $750 million. We now expect to come in at the bottom end of that range as the pandemic has delayed some project spending. While we will not provide specific guidance on 2021 today, I do want to highlight some of the larger anticipated headwinds and tailwinds compared to our 2020 non-GAAP adjusted operating income. Primary anticipated headwinds are the volume and mix implications of COVID. The primary anticipated tailwinds include the assumed lack of valid initiative defense costs and hopefully a reduction in net COVID-related direct impact. On calcimimetics, while we still need to wait for CMS' final rule later this fall, we do not expect for calcimimetics to be a large headwind or tailwind to adjusted OI. Finally on share repurchases. We had indicated in March that we are temporarily suspending share repurchases. We did not repurchase any shares during Q2 or during the month of July. We are carefully considering when to restart our share repurchase activity and will do so at the discretion of management and within the authorization provided by our Board of Directors. With that operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] Speakers, the first question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. If you can talk a little bit more about operating income guidance. Looking at the first half of the year at 16.2%, despite all these COVID costs and looks as though the implied, margin for the back half of the year is sort of between 12% and sort of 13.4%. So a pretty big decline. Can you sort of walk us through sort of how we would get there? Is it from the treatment growth sort of slowing down? Just walk us through the details of sort of how we get to sort of pretty big margin contraction in the back half of the year? Joel Ackerman : Sure. Hello, Pito. I'll take, Joel here. So if you take the middle of our range -- well again we're not guiding to OI but taking the middle of our guidance, I think you would calculate a roughly $175 million decline in OI from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. The three biggest components of that are the reduction in calcimimetics profits, which as we've talked about in the past most of our number are $40 million to $70 million. And by the way, that we do expect that number to be in the top half of that range. So most of that comes in the first half of the year. Second is the ballot initiative in California. We've talked about that as a $0.50 a share cost and that is primarily in the back half of the year. And then third, I'd point to COVID that while the costs associated with COVID could come down over the course of the year, the offsets would also come down. And we're using a pretty wide range of assumptions around what could happen in the back half of the year with COVID, but the back half of the year will have two quarters' worth of COVID while the first half of the year really only had one quarter's worth of COVID.  So if you put those three things together, you'll get the vast majority of that $175 million decline. Couple of other things I'd point out. One is there were some relatively small onetime things in the front half of the year that aided OI and those could -- and there could be some negative onetime things in the back half of the year. And finally because of COVID and potentially other dynamics there are some costs that we didn't incur in the first half of the year and we think those could show up in the back half of the year and that could be anything from G&A projects to facility maintenance and those would be the other two components that would get you to that $175 million adjusted OI decline at the center of the guidance range. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then as a follow-up can you talk a little bit more about the final Medicare Advantage rule? Can you sort of walk us through sort of how that impacts your negotiations with MA plans? When do you think you'll start seeing impact from the changing rule? Is it a 2021 event? Because of the multiyear contracts is more spread out. And in your discussions with MA plans, have you had conversations around bonus payments for better managing patients or is it too soon? And then finally what's the checks and balances on the MA plans? They don't certify a network that is too narrow. Javier Rodriguez : Pito let me grab that. And Joel if you want to supplement it and you had several pieces if I miss anything please come at me again. The short answer is we don't know what the implications are. What we do know is that from a network adequacy there used to be an objective standard that had time and distance and now its subjective standard. It might mean nothing. It might mean that the plan's just now attest and life goes on as it did in the past. It also might mean that some plans might get aggressive and not have adequate standards in networks. So it's too early to tell. But from our perspective it is pulling out and discriminating against the ESRD patients because if you don't have the proper network adequacy you in essence are disencouraging enrollment. And so from our perspective it's just an unusual thing and it goes against the patient's rights. We waited for a very long time to have the ESRD patients be on equal footing to everyone and they deserve the right to pick MA just like anyone else. And so that was a disappointing part. As it relates to negotiations as you said we have multiyear contracts with most of our MA plans. We are working with them. We think that we combined can work well together, can work on MLR and could do really good things for the patients as it relates to coordination of care. But it is too early to tell as not many contracts have occurred. Did I miss any of your question? Pito Chickering : No. But I mean I guess the last one would be what are the checks and balances? So if the MA plan has to self-certify what's the balance to make sure that they don't self-certify a network that is too narrow? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I mean that's part of the problem. But right now it goes into some kind of subjective attestation that they have proper network. And from our perspective of course what we're doing is keeping our radar up to make sure that the spirit of the law is adhered to. But we don't know how it will be enforced. Pito Chickering : Great. Thank you so much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Just wanted to maybe follow up on that I guess you mentioned most of your contracts are multiyear contracts. So does that mean that you're entering 2021 with relatively similar economics within your MA plans as you have today in 2020? Javier Rodriguez : I think it's fair to say that. Yes, on any given year you have renegotiations, but it's the same every year. Once in a while they overlap. But it is a fair assumption. At this juncture of course, we still have the back end of the year to do negotiations. And there is a big appetite from us and from the plans on trying to do something that is useful and creative to the system so that we take more risk and provide higher end services to the patients. So we're still in the conversations. We'll see how it pans out. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes. And I guess it just happened a couple of months ago, so maybe not many contracts have been implemented. But I mean are you at all -- I assume you always have conversations with health plans. I mean, does it sound like they are planning for aggressive changes at this point? Or do you have any sense? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I think the reality Kevin is that everybody is trying to do something constructive as it relates to this opportunity for the patients to have coordinated care. And so the plans and us are trying to see what risk appetite they have, what can our systems do, what can their system do, but both sides have big appetite to do something that's useful for this patient population. And so we'll see how that pans out over time. Kevin Fischbeck : And is there a point in time this year where you think you would have a better sense of this on the Q3 call? Will you pretty much have good visibility as far as 2021 goes or do we have to wait until Q4 results? Javier Rodriguez : I think it will take a little longer to play out because of the interplay of expirations and when contracts come up coupled with the fact that I don't know how COVID is going to impact negotiations. So if I had to guess I think it's going to take a bit longer than that. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then Joel, I guess as far as your calcimimetics point, I guess you're saying that next year it will be neutral to earnings. So if you're making close to $70 million this year, the thought is that it should be a similar number next year. Is that the right way to think about it? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So look there remains some uncertainty for next year, but there was certainly a scenario where the OI went to zero. So relative to that, we feel like we're in much better shape and I'd say 70-ish is a reasonable midpoint of the range. That said, I would highlight one thing that's important for the way we're thinking about OI going forward, which is we have called out calcimimetics as something that I guess, I'd call nonrecurring because of the TDAPA period and the nature of TDAPA reimbursement it is not permanent. As this enters the bundle next year, I would consider the OI that we are generating from calcimimetics to now be part of our core OI because it has permanent funding. It's a permanent component of the bundle. We're going to stop calling it out and in my mind it will become part of our core earning power of the business. Javier Rodriguez : And Kevin, I'll just add one point in case it's not clear for some. The reason why we don't have a precise number and Joel will give you a bit of a range is because CMS is going to adjust the amount with Q4 ASP and we don't have an exact number, we have an estimate. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That all makes sense. And I guess the way to think about it is that in the first half of next year, it will be a headwind. But in the back half of next year year-over-year it will be a tailwind because it will be uniformly spread out throughout the year, sort of, front-end loaded this year. Joel Ackerman : I think that's a good way to think about it. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. And then maybe last question. The -- it wasn't clear to me exactly. You mentioned about why the commercial mix was strong. I think you made some comments around your patients signing up for COBRA and buying alternative coverage that makes sense to me. But some of the other comments about less job loss and things like that. Can you go back over what you were getting at there? Why it would be the case that maybe so far at least that the job loss has been less impactful to your patients than it would be other -- than you would expect? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So there are three dynamics affecting mix. The unemployment question is one of them. So let me tackle that. And we highlighted three things. One is job loss in our population is lower than what we're seeing in the national averages. And we think that is because the employment mix or not exactly what to call it of our commercial population leans more towards things like government and education and less towards things like hospitality and travel. So the sectors that our employees, our patients work in have been less impacted by the economic effects of COVID. So that's number one. Second lot of the unemployment that we saw in our population was the result of furloughs rather than job losses and a lot of those have reversed. So those patients never lost their coverage and they're now back at work or they expect to be back at work. And third as our patients have lost their employer-based commercial coverage, they have worked hard to maintain alternative commercial coverage either through COBRA or the exchanges. And we're seeing that happening at a rate higher than what we've seen historically. That said, we don't have a lot of historical experience with exchanges, because the exchanges didn't exist, during the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. So that's the -- that's why we're -- why we think, we're seeing less of a mix decline on commercial related to unemployment. I would also point out that, mortality is actually beneficial to commercial mix in the short-term, because older patients are passing away at a higher rate than younger patients. And government patients tend to be older and commercial patients tend to be younger. So that's helping. And then the decline in transplants is also helping. Commercial patients get transplanted, at a much higher rate than government patients. Javier Rodriguez : Kevin, I'd just like to state one thing an overarching important part that we've learned, and that is that in talking with our commercial patient, it has really reinforced how hard our patients work to keep their commercial insurance and how much they value it. And so that has been an absolute clear takeaway from this period. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Mok from Barclays. Your line is now open. Andrew Mok : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow-up on, Medicare Advantage, as we approach the full open enrolment season what's the awareness level among your traditional Medicare patients that they're going to have the option to enrol in a private Medicare plan this fall? And relatedly, what are some of the patient education efforts you're doing on this topic? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Let me grab that one. The -- as you would expect with any population and anything new the information flow is wide in range from the people that are up to speed to the people that are completely uninformed on it. And what we're working really hard to do is to have totally unbiased and objective training, that is customized to each person. So you can look at it from your personal perspective, because what's good insurance for one person might not be good insurance for the other, depending on what you have as a secondary coverage, or what your family needs are, or where you are in your life. And so our main objective is for people to have a balanced perspective that are aware of their choices and actually gets them to pick what's right for them. And the knowledge base is pretty much all over the place. Andrew Mok : Got it, okay and then just wanted to follow up on the strong cost management in the quarter, can you put some numbers around some of the productivity and G&A gains you saw in Q2? And how much of that you think is sustainable, heading into 2021? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So there's nothing in particular, I'd call out on either of those things. The -- there's -- I'd say, on the G&A maybe there's a little bit of a question on whether we're going to give some of that back in the back half of the year. And that's some of that half one over half two bridge that I put back -- that I pointed out at the beginning of the call. But there's nothing unusual that I'd call out other than that. Andrew Mok : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. First, just one more on Medicare Advantage networks, Javier, I was a little surprised when you answered previous questions saying you might not know how the networks look by your next call. And the -- my understanding of MA the plans have to put out their products by I think, its mid-October. If they were -- at that point don't they have to publish their networks? Wouldn't you know whether you're in or out of the network at that point, for 2021 at least? Javier Rodriguez : Yes you're absolutely correct, Justin. So maybe I was answering a different question which is I think what I was answering is well you understand the sustainability of there's going to be macro changes. In the short-term networks, I don't anticipate anything major changing. I could be surprised, but I don't anticipate that. What I was answering is how it will change over time. And I thought that, by then we would not see how it will behave over an extended period of time. Justin Lake : Got it. So the takeaway is given your conversations and given how late, we are in the year already, you don't think there's much likelihood of DaVita being removed from a network in Medicare Advantage for 2021. But there could be some evaluation over time into 2022 and 2023, in terms of pricing and network design? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I mean, I said differently you have some add backs, but you won't have a significant part of the portfolio or anything. And so that will play over time. And so you are correct in your assumptions that in the fall, we will have clarity. But as you know, you could be in the network in the fall and then a month or two later you can be out of network. So I don't know how much you can bank on that fall in network statement holding for the future. Justin Lake : Got it. Thanks. And then, I wanted to ask about the -- I apologize if I missed this, Joel, but your revenue per treatment was up pretty significantly sequentially. Can you give us as much detail and that's with calcimimetics looking like its declining. So ex-calcimimetics, what's the number there and the sequential increase? And what are the kind of key drivers that you want us to focus on? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So, ex-calcimimetics it's between $5 and $6. We're talking quarter-over-quarter RPT change. A lot of that is seasonal. And think of coinsurance and deductibles and some lower bad debt associated with patients flowing through those, that is by far the biggest factor. The other stuff is just some, I'd say, typical bouncing around of MA mix and commercial mix and a little bit of pricing. It's mostly a seasonal impact. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Joel, the only thing I would add to that is, there's a little sequestration in there as well. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Yes. I forgot about that. Thank you, Javier. Justin Lake : Yes, me too. So that's a -- Joel Ackerman : I am sorry, Justin, just to be clear, the number I gave backed out the sequestration. So that $5 to $6 was without sequestration. Sequestration is worth about $1.5. Justin Lake : Okay. And what was calcimimetics worth? Since, we're on this topic. Joel Ackerman : I know, someone was going to ask me that. I think it was $0.50 although, I'll get you that exact number. Justin Lake : Is that revenue or profit? Joel Ackerman : No, I'm sorry. Ignore the $0.50 number. The RPT from calcimimetics went from $9.55 to $7, so about a $2.5 decline as a result of calcimimetics RPT. The OI, so the dollar number went from $35 million in Q1 to $19 million in Q2. Justin Lake : Okay. And then, in terms of commercial mix and commercial treatment growth, you're saying mix was flat and therefore commercial patient growth was similar to overall patient growth? And mix didn't have much to do with this, in terms of that $5 to $6? Joel Ackerman : Right. Justin Lake : And is this a reasonable number to jump off of ex-calcimimetics? Is this a -- do you think this is a good number for 3Q, 4Q that we should think about? Joel Ackerman : I think it is a reasonable starting point, although, I think, you'll see that negative seasonality in Q1, you'd expect to see that next year. So don't use it as an annual run rate, but use it as a number for the next couple of quarters. Justin Lake : Okay, great. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo : Thanks. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the implied core growth in the quarter. You guys usually have tremendous visibility into a lot of the expenses, as you set your original plan. And now, we're looking at a number that's much higher. So it certainly seems to imply that something got much better. So I'm really kind of curious what that is, because as we net out the COVID cost in calcimimetics to sequester, everything you've laid out, I mean, it implies, by my math, that the core OI was up 8% year-over-year. So I'm just trying to take a crack at this from a cost structure standpoint again. Is there anything else that you can point to that has come in meaningfully below what your original expectations were coming into the year? Joel Ackerman : So, Whit, if I were to try and to explain why the numbers are better than what we expected, first, it's all core margin. There's nothing unusual here. The business -- the core business is performing well. I would point to productivity being a bit better than we expected. Facility costs are a bit better than we expected. RPT is a little bit better, but that's offset a fair bit by volume being light. So, think of core margin largely driven by good cost management. Whit Mayo : Okay. Is there any way to put numbers around either the COBRA or the exchange uptake? I mean, I presume you have a lot of data internally around your patients and their coverage. And I'm just sort of trying to wrap my head around the conversion rate into COBRA, because I presume that it's fairly high. So, I thought, I'd just maybe ask a little bit more directly the question. Javier Rodriguez : I looked at the question you're asking we don't disclose it in detail. But I think what you're trying to get to directionally is, do we have a big spike in COBRA that in 18 months or in some date in the future that will come to roost. Is that fair where you're going? Whit Mayo : No that actually isn't the premise at all. I mean, I think the debate in the marketplace to be perfectly candid is that you have -- you're very dependent on your commercial mix and so people have been concerned. And I think my point is that a lot of these patients find that they have alternative options and a great number of them a high percent buying coverage through COBRA. So it was actually -- the premise was totally the opposite. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I think what I would say is what we said earlier which is -- and I think it's consistent to what you're saying. Yes, our business relies on that patient population in an incredible way. We have been very impressed with the passion that our patients have to keep their commercial coverage in one way or another. And as Joel said, there's a big distinction between furloughed versus permanent job loss and we have seen that a good chunk of our patients that are working that were furloughed are back to work. And then out of the ones that had permanent job loss, which the number again was less than we anticipated many have had alternative coverage. I think that, covers the whole spectrum there. Whit Mayo : No it's helpful. And maybe one last one and this is perhaps an impossible question but I thought I'd ask it. Javier what is a hypothetical Biden administration mean for DaVita and the industry? I mean the charitable premium rule has been sitting out at the OMB forever. I mean that was obviously, there under the prior administration who knows, if that revives itself I have no idea what the status of it is. And we rarely talked about public option Medicare expansion on these calls maybe we're all just smart enough to be more skeptical on policy like this. But I'd just be curious to hear your general thoughts about what Biden would mean? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. It's a great question one that we've talked about. In general, what we try to do and we've done a decent job is to make sure that we're talking to both Republican and Democrats because our issue goes across both sides. I mean, the biggest change that we can think of as it relates to the policy is probably one of tax and whether they're able -- if there is a Biden administration whether you also have the Senate or not will obviously be a big driver of tax policy. As it relates to health care policy, as you know, it is a -- as you said a much bigger lift to change and we will of course be a part of it. But what we want to do is continuing to push and advocate for our patients and for integrated care regardless of who's in the White House. Whit Mayo : Okay. Thanks, a lot. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Gary Taylor : I wanted to just come back to one topic that's been asked about a few different ways and I'll ask it a little bit different see if I can get a little more help. Obviously, an amazing job on expense management maybe 2Q is turning out to be the amazing cost management quarters. But when you had laid out last quarter up to an incremental $100 million of COVID expenses, which is like $13 a treatment certainly didn't think patient care costs would go up $0.62 sequentially. So I've heard the comments about the productivity the facility costs health benefits. I guess, could we just talk a little more about the source of the productivity? I know you would even for a period of time I think were paying an extra $100 a month to a fair number of your teammates and it's kind of the opposite of productivity you had set up some split shifts to sort of isolate COVID positive and suspected patients. So the whole orientation, I guess was this is going to be the opposite of a really strong productivity quarter and yet you've performed really, really well. So maybe just some examples of how you're finding this productivity and what sort of facility costs? And was the health benefits piece just your own employees consuming less health care and that was quite material. I know you've been asked several times. So just anything incremental would just help us sort of think about modeling going forward. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. There's a lot going on and we're very proud Gary of the cost management situation. So let me try to be as helpful as possible because there are several things. First a clarification yes on our health care expenditures our teammates just like everybody else used less benefits on non-essential care. So that is one. Number two our caregivers' sense of purpose was really passionate and so therefore we had less turnover because people felt that sense of obligation to take care of our patients. And so the combination of economic need and appreciating a job, while so many people were furloughed and lay off and the sense of commitment to our patients had less training expense. And then the last thing that I would say is that also there were some of our teammates that were COVID positive. And so what we ended up doing is having to have basically in some places like New York and others where staffing was really at a premium. And so when you cohorted centers, et cetera which is what you're alluding to earlier sometimes those shifts were not as inefficient as we anticipated, because those shifts tended to be more full than once anticipated. And so if you have a full COVID positive shift even though it's cohorted, it's not inefficient. When it's really inefficient is when you have one or two patients in it. And so the cumulative math compounded over the quarter and we were very diligent in trying to manage it all. Gary Taylor : That's helpful. Two more quick ones. On the $35 million legal charge was that related to any legal issue that had been historically disclosed in your filings? Or was this professional liability issue? Or is there any other color on that? Joel Ackerman : Yes, I'll take that one Gary. It was related to shareholder litigation that's been hanging out there for a bunch of years related to CPA. Our view is what we did was appropriate, but to just clean this up and move on we thought it was worth settling this. So it's related to that issue. Gary Taylor : Thank you. And then just last one for me. And I've just forgot the difference between your 0.7% increase in treatments per day and your 1.6% normalized when you have the exact same number of treatment days 78.0, 78.0 so the calendar isn't driving that and I don't think there's been divestitures. So I'm just trying to recall how we square that difference? Joel Ackerman : Yes. There's a bunch of noise associated with divestitures and some other things, but there is one big movement that I would highlight there, which is we had a bunch of clinics that we deconsolidated as of the first of the year. And those are treatments that we would back out of NAG, but we don't back them out of the treatment count. And that's worth I think about 50 bps of the difference. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matt Larew from William Blair. Your line is now open. Matt Larew : Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a little bit about the footprint. I think we heard on the first quarter that in terms of the footprint build, I think you said maybe wait and see in terms of what happens with industry volumes and what happens on the home side, and obviously 28 new centers. And then maybe added on to that after a couple of years of kind of a stagnant OUS number, I know there's a lot of rationalization going on. You've now added about 40 new centers OUS in the last four quarters. Maybe just an update in terms of development both on the U.S. and OUS side? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I'll take that one Javier. So most of the action is on the U.S. side as you would expect, the number there is a bit of a lagging indicator, because it depends on when we get certified by CMS. If you wanted to think about a number that tracked more carefully with the decision-making and the CapEx number, it would be based on when the clinics are completed what we call a certificate of occupancy, and you'd see that number much lower. So for next year, I don't want to give a range yet, but you'll see that number come way down again. And I think going forward people want to understand how we're doing in terms of building capacity and being capital efficient. I think the development CapEx number is going to be a better indicator of that than the clinic number that we've disclosed historically. And that's driven partly by this timing issue. It's also driven by the fact that we're building more home-only clinics, which tend to be cheaper and aren't in the clinic count that we've historically disclosed. So the message is the de novo continues to come down as NAG comes down as we move more to home. There could be kind of an additional delay associated with COVID partly, because of a temporary decline in NAG partly, because it's just hard to build clinics in the context of COVID. But relative to the commitment we made around capital efficiency, I think we're continuing to deliver on what we said we would. Matt Larew : Got it. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask a little bit about the comment you made around missed treatments. I know you mentioned that commercial patients tend to be higher in terms of transplants. But what do you see in terms of discrepancies amongst different payer classes for visit patterns did patients in the Medicare population tend to have higher missed treatments during this period and wasn't missed treatments much lower with commercial? I guess, just what does that look like amongst payer classes? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. We didn't break it out by payer class. But one of the things that we are very happy about the fact that missed treatments went down during this period, meaning that our patients who are taking the virus very seriously they were taking care of themselves and then we were able to take care of them outside of the hospital. And so, I would have to say that the math -- the way the math works that it was across all payer classes, but I don't know that with certainty because I didn't divide it by payer class. But in general, we were very happy to see that hospitalizations went down for our chronic population in a significant way. Matt Larew : And then was there any change in terms of referral origin throughout the quarter? Or anything you see from COVID, I know normally about half your patients start dialysis in the hospital setting, but just curious as COVID has progressed and hospital visit patterns have changed a little bit, what you're seeing in terms of origination? Javier Rodriguez : So I think your question is the way that we get our patients change meaning if there's less crashers into the hospital and going into our center first. And the short answer is that we have not seen a change a noticeable change in the way that our patients come. Matt Larew : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Hey. Just a follow-up on a couple of things. I guess first you obviously were at the low end of your treatment guidance for the quarter. It sounds like you're certainly below that for at least a few more quarters. How confident are you that this is purely COVID related and not a continuation of the decline I guess that we've been seeing in the last couple of years and you had a much higher growth rate. A few years ago, you've taken that down a couple of times. What amount of visibility do you have for this? Is this a temporary thing and we'll get back to the 1.5% to 2.5%? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Kevin, why don't I give you a little of the variables? And then if you want to attest the assumptions you can, because there is an interplay of several variables. And so in essence what would happen in the quarter is mortality increase. And as we've told you, it skewed toward the more older population. The acute volume -- the acute treatments went down and that's obviously in our mind because of nonessential care being delayed. So we think that that is absolutely COVID related. The incidents of our new patients came down as we talked to our nephrologist -- we tend to think just in a high level \"Okay your kidneys failed you have to go dialysis.\" But the reality is that it's more nuanced than that. That you have some remaining renal function and sometimes your nephrologist has a decision to make are you better off starting dialysis with some renal function? So that you do better on that therapy. And right now during the pandemic they're saying \"Is it better to start you off a little later?\" So we saw our new patient incidents decrease. We of course saw no visitors because of travel restrictions. And then we saw a decrease in transplants because obviously transplants were shut temporarily which in essence was an offset and so -- and then as we already talked about, we saw missed treatments go down so that it was also an increase to volume. So when we net all of that and we give you what we expect in the back end, our assumption is that over time this is likely to normalize except of the impact on mortality over time. Kevin Fischbeck : So all that makes sense. Does that then mean like just kind of in response to the last question about how patients are coming in that you're not seeing more patients crash now, but you think that if this continues that we will then see that and not that that's a good sign at all, but it would be at least a good sign that fundamental demand is higher than what you're seeing? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. And that would be all speculative. I'm just telling you what our nephrologists are telling us about their practices. And most of the practices for a little while obviously were shut down for the nonessential care that we're still rounding in the hospitals. So what we're anticipating now that we're talking to our nephrologists and their practices are back open is that they have not seen any dramatic change. And of course that's not scientific. We're just telling you what we're hearing from our nephrology practices. Kevin Fischbeck : Got it. And then I guess you talked earlier about how this quarter is coming better because productivity has come in better than expected. Is there a reason to think that these productivity gains cannot be maintained into a more normal operating environment if COVID starts to go away next year? Can you keep this productivity going? I don't think you mentioned that as one of the headwinds to 2021? Javier Rodriguez : Yes productivity will be interesting. Of course, some of the things will go away. People will end up going back to the doctor and our benefit expense will go back up. As it relates to training expenses and retention, I think that will be highly linked to the economy and how that's doing and how people are feeling about valuing their job and the sense of purpose that we're giving them. And so I think in general, you could say it would -- it could stay and then you could make an argument that it'll go back to what it was. But I think it will be highly linked to what the broader economy is doing and how COVID is impacting the time. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks. A few follow-ups here. One, Joel your corporate and ancillary segments look down pretty materially 2Q versus 1Q. Just curious, if you can note anything there and how to think about those numbers in the second half? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I am trying to remember, if there's anything in particular. We had a severance charge built in. It was about $12 million, and I'm trying to remember if that was Q1 or Q2. I'll get you the news on that. Jim Gustafson : I'll answer it Joel. That was Q2 and that was in the corporate segment. Q1 had a large benefit in international, which is in the strategic initiatives segment from exchange rates and it swung a little bit the other way. Joel Ackerman : Yes. We had -- thank you, Jim. I appreciate it. We had $10 million of positive foreign exchange in Q1 through international and that swung to a $4 million negative in the second quarter. Justin Lake : Great. That explains it. Thanks. So then, back to Whit's question the -- obviously the -- on your comments around COBRA and exchange take up being greater. Given where the economy is going that's a pretty important swing factor. And obviously, it sounds like it's going better than expected. So it would be helpful to us to kind of understand where it's been historically, and where it is now? Could you share us just even round numbers? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Well, I won't give you round numbers, and let me make sure I'm answering the right question Justin. Are you asking mix of COBRA versus other commercial insurance? Justin Lake : No. I'm asking the -- you said, there's been a pretty material increase in the number of people signing up for COBRA exchanges when they lose their job versus what you've seen in other periods like this? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. What I would say right now, without getting into details is I'll just reinforce what I've said that our patients are very passionate about keeping their commercial insurance for a variety of reasons including their family coverage and some believe that it enhances their odds of getting a transplant. And in some instances it's, obviously, the cheapest coverage with the most flexibility. And so, they're making those decisions carefully as they know it impacts their life in a nontrivial way since they consume so much health care. Justin Lake : And then Joel, you gave 2021 headwinds tailwinds. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Justin Lake : And you didn't mention Medicare Advantage accelerating growth as a tailwind to 2021. So I'm curious is your view that we shouldn't expect it to be impactful next year? I mean you don't think it's going to ramp versus what we've seen in the last two or three years? And if so, why not? Joel Ackerman : Well, I think we've been pretty consistent with what we've said about Medicare Advantage, which is we don't see 2021 as this huge inflection point in enrollment. We think MA enrollment will continue to grow. It could grow a little bit faster next year. But we've just had a different view than others in the industry. We think a lot of our patients are happy with their Medicare fee-for-service coverage. There is some level of inertia. And we just don't see it being this massive uptake in one year. Justin Lake : Got it. And I just think there's a pretty big delta between massive uptake and what looks like a couple of percent increase in penetration a year, maybe a little more. Right, so are you saying that you really think it's probably going to be the typical 200 to 300 basis point increase that we've seen in the last few years relative to what I think some might have expected it to be more like 500 plus? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Let me jump in, because you have as much information as we do on this Justin. What we can tell you is we're roughly around 25% of the Medicare patients are picking, have MA in our population. You probably have a better number than I do, but the industry tells is around 35%. And so everybody continues to say, will it be more than 35%? Are we going to get to 35% in year one of enrollment? And what we've consistently said quarter-over-quarter is that we think it will be more gradual and we think it's more gradual for some of the dynamics that have been said today that there's a patient population that's uninformed. There's a patient population that likes status quo, and so don't underestimate inertia. If you say, well, even though there might be a better product for me. I like my product or I'm satisfied with my product, and many people just don't have interest in switching, because they fear the unknown. And so, we're just saying change for some are hard and we think that it will be more gradual and we could be wrong. But what we want to make sure is there's a time where there was a lot of people saying that the change was going to be very, very fast and it was going to be a quick ramp up. And while they could be right, we don't think that that's the way it will play out. Justin Lake : Okay. Thanks for the color, guys. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. I'll keep this brief due to the time. Can you remind us of what your commercial pricing was during 2Q? And has it been relatively stable for 2020 so far? Javier Rodriguez : I'm sorry, what is the question on commercial pricing? Pito Chickering : Can you -- could you tell us what commercial pricing was? Did it increase in 2Q? And has what you've seen in the commercial pricing been fairly stable so far in 2020? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. There's nothing to call out on our commercial pricing. Pito Chickering : Okay. How much productivity that you guys saw in 2Q came from shifting people into the home setting? Javier Rodriguez : I don't know the answer to that. Joel, do you know the answer to that? I mean, in general -- Joel Ackerman : Yes. I think we're not going to get into the nuances of productivity changes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think the message we're trying to deliver is we continue to do a good job on cost management. It's driving good margins in the core but I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then last one here is I may have asked this probably earlier on the call, I guess opened up 28 centers during 2Q. To your point that's a lagging indicator of where things are going. If we think about sort of, 2021 in terms of the split between home clinics and standard clinics what's the right split as these eventually flow through into where you guys want to target opening in clinics? Javier Rodriguez : I do not have the number in here, but Joel keep me honest that our number is roughly 50-50 on our growth for next year between in-center and home centers. Joel Ackerman : That is correct. Pito Chickering : Perfect. Thanks, guys very much. I appreciate your time. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, Pito. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo : Thanks. You guys just have to cut us off. I've got one more because I've had several e-mails on the topic of revenue per treatment. And you reported $3.52 in the quarter take out $7 for calcimimetics we're down to $3.45. I calculated the sequester maybe being $1.60. So I'm getting down to $3.44 and you did the same math last quarter it was $3.38. So you've got $6 of growth in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So I guess the question is if your commercial mix is largely flat versus the first quarter. What drove that incremental improvement? I mean historically there's not that much seasonality in the pricing when we reflect back on prior year. So just trying to flesh out if there's anything else that might be influencing that number up? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So Whit it is largely seasonality. I think we're seeing a little bit more seasonality this year because of some bad debt dynamics. But I would say about two-thirds of that $6 and your math is pretty spot on is seasonality. The balance is I'd say normal fluctuations. Whit Mayo : So when you say bad debt does this mean that patients have already run through their deductible? I guess I want to maybe understand a little bit more exactly what -- Joel Ackerman : Yes. As patients run through their deductibles and their coinsurance and there are some other dynamics that play through in bad debt. That's exactly what it is. It's exactly what you'd expect I think. Whit Mayo : Okay. Okay. But no other like payer settlements or anything unusual that -- Joel Ackerman : Nothing else to call out. It was -- I think Justin asked me before is this a reasonable RPT to use to start your modeling for the rest of the year? And I think the answer is yes. Whit Mayo : Thanks for the clarification. Operator : Thank you. At this time speakers, we don't have any questions on queue. Javier Rodriguez : Well, let me thank you for all the questions and thank you for the interest in the company and let me finish with three statements. Number one, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of the care and the accomplishment of the team. They are working non-stop and it is a beautiful thing. Number two our core business is strong. And number three we continue to make great strides on our capabilities to advance the care continuum across home hospital and in-center. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Be well and stay safe. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of federal securities laws. All these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements, except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our third quarter financial results. We are now 9 months into the pandemic, and one thing is clear : our team of caregivers is committed to serving our patients. Because of our team, our business is performing well despite disruptions from the pandemic, wildfires and hurricanes. I've said it before, and it's worth repeating, I am incredibly proud to be part of DaVita and to serve alongside our 65,000 teammates who work so hard to provide our patients with life sustaining care. It is our people who make our business resilient in the face of so many challenging externalities. Through these challenging times, our focus remains on our patients and on building capabilities to enhance their care and their experience in the future. Today, there are still too many patients who are surprised by their start on dialysis, which impacts their ability to adjust their lifestyle and then to choose their optimal modality. Therefore, we work with patients with chronic kidney disease, known as CKD, to help them understand how to stay healthy, delay the progression of kidney disease, pursue transplantation and evaluate different treatment options. Education is one important factor to avoid a surprise start. We are excited to have reached a milestone this quarter of educating 200,000 people through our Kidney Smart program and no-cost CKD education program. During the pandemic, we have shifted all Kidney Smart classes to a virtual format, and we continue to have high engagement with CKD patients. The program has healthy results as individuals would attend a Kidney Smart class are 6x more likely to start dialysis at home, experience 38% fewer missed treatments in the first 90 days on dialysis and have 30% fewer hospitalizations. Now on to quarterly results. Q3 was another strong quarter for our company. Total revenue came in largely as expected. While volume growth was weaker than historical levels due to the impact of COVID, total revenue held up due to the year-to-date improvement in revenue per treatment. Our costs came in significantly below our forecast as a result of lower COVID impact this quarter and continued strong cost management. Looking forward, I remain confident in the strength of our business model as well as our earnings and free cash flow growth. Due to our strong performance over the past year, we're ahead of plan that we discussed last year's Capital Markets Day, both financially and strategically. Financially, we're ahead of the expected adjusted earnings per share guidance we shared both in 2020 and 2022. Today, we are again raising our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $7.35 to $7.60. Over the past year, we've been able to achieve operating margin increases in share repurchases faster than expected. In addition, we've also lowered our debt cost, consistent to what we expressed at Capital Markets Day. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to deliver continued capital-efficient growth from 2020 levels over the next few years. To quantify this, we expect to be able to deliver annual adjusted EPS growth on average in the low double digits. I want to highlight that we are accomplishing this while continuing to invest in innovation, building new capabilities and strengthening our platform. Strategically, we have made tangible progress in extending the breadth and depth of our clinical and operational capabilities, fueled by our digital transformation in several areas. We believe that these capabilities in our platform will create a competitive advantage with a focus on our patients, nephrologist partners and payer partners. We also see a path to using these capabilities to improve the quality and value of care for our patients across the health care delivery system. For example, we're personalizing the care for patients across the kidney care continuum using proprietary systems that we've been developing for years in partnership. We've been with industry leaders, including Epic, Cerner, Salesforce and Google. We have more to do to effectuate our strategy, but we're beginning to see the benefits from these tools in the form of AI-driven models that personalize dosing for certain therapeutics, anticipate patients' clinical status and help avoid hospitalization, anticipate patients who may drop off from therapy and identify CKD stage 4 patients who are likely to progress quickly to ESRD and help avoid unplanned dialysis starts. As we place these tools and information in the hands of nephrologists and our caregivers, we envision 3 significant benefits : one, enabling a best-in-class patient experience, delivering individualized care at scale; two, enabling our physicians to deliver industry-leading clinical outcomes; and three, lowering the total cost of care of kidney care populations through avoiding disruptions caused by preventable hospitalization stays and changes in modalities that are not clinically driven. We're also making strategic progress in our shift to value-based payment model. Over the last decade, we built capabilities and real-world experience managing the total cost of care for ESRD patients through our partnerships and the unique relationships and access we have to more than 200,000 dialysis patients. We've developed a model of care that is tailored to the specific needs of dialysis patients and have applied this to a variety of value-based payment models, including shared savings and full capitation. Our discussions with payers about using value-based arrangements to align incentives and drive better outcomes have accelerated in recent quarters. On the government side, we're carefully considering the models for value-based arrangements developed by CMS. On the commercial side, we continue to contract for pay-for-performance models for both ESRD and CKD patients. We're also using the expected growth of Medicare Advantage in the ESRD population to accelerate conversations with MA plans about new payment models. We're excited for the momentum toward value-based care, and we're prepared for opportunities to partner with government and commercial payers. We believe that our current capabilities, deep experience and national scale give us a superior platform for delivering value to our partners, patients and payers. Now I'll turn it over to Joel, who will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. Q3 results reflected another quarter of strong financial performance for DaVita. We significantly outperformed expectations as a result of strength in the underlying business and the benefits of some nonrecurring tailwinds. I'll start my comments with Q3 then cover our guidance for Q4 and some thoughts about longer-term outlook. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $438 million, a sequential decline of approximately $24 million compared to the adjusted OI in Q2. This decline is primarily the result of 2 things : first is the ballot in California. We contributed approximately $66 million to the industry initiative to defeat Prop. 23 in Q3, in line with our expectations for a full year impact from ballot initiative costs of approximately $0.50 per share. Second, we saw an approximately $50 million OI improvement in Q3 compared to Q2 from COVID. On our last call, I cited an estimated $20 million to $30 million of net costs associated with COVID in the second quarter. We expected COVID impact in Q3 to be similar to Q2. However, we actually experienced a net positive impact of approximately $20 million to $30 million in the quarter, a $50 million favorable swing over last quarter at the midpoint of the ranges. This was the result of significantly lower direct costs from COVID, with almost no change in the offsets we saw in Q2. After adjusting for these two items, the underlying earnings power of the business remained strong in Q3 and consistent with Q2. Looking forward, COVID remains a source of significant uncertainty. The course of the pandemic remains difficult to forecast and its impact on NAG, commercial mix and operating expense creates a wide range of potential outcomes for Q4 and for 2021. Driven by the strong performance in Q3, our anticipation of another strong underlying result in Q4 and allowing for a range of potential COVID-related costs, we're updating our 2020 guidance as follows. We are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating income margin in 2020 to 15.3% to 15.6%. We're increasing our guidance for adjusted EPS in 2020 to $7.35 to $7.60, and we are increasing our 2020 free cash flow guidance to $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. Let me add a few thoughts to Javier's comments on our longer-term outlook for low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. First, we currently expect this growth to be the result of adjusted operating income growth in the low to mid-single digits, with the balance resulting from disciplined capital allocation and lower debt costs. Second, this excludes any large uncertain events such as change to federal tax rate or the repeal of the ACA. And third, we see this as the earnings and cash flow potential of the business in an average year, but performance in any individual year could vary materially from these trends. For 2021, we plan to give more details on our next earnings call. With that said, I'll call out some headwinds and tailwinds that could materialize. First, we expect the absence of ballot initiative costs to be a tailwind. Next, if Prop. 23 in California were to pass and be implemented, we expect that there would be a material cost and operating challenges to comply with its requirements in 2021. Third, COVID is impossible to predict, although our current expectation is that it could be a significant headwind next year. The negative impact on NAG accumulates over time so we'd expect our year-over-year growth in treatment volume to continue to be depressed even as the direct impact on our patients diminishes. We also expect to lose the benefit of Medicare sequestration suspension and expect some of the other mitigants, like lower health benefit expenses and travel costs, to reverse. The impact on commercial enrollment has been lower-than-expected to date, although the longer-term impact of COVID on the economy could result in mix deterioration in 2021. We're also seeing increased unit cost for PPE that are likely to be a headwind for 2021. We believe the one potential tailwind from COVID would be a reduction in some of the direct costs that we incurred in the - early on in the pandemic. Next, while the contribution from calcimimetics should be relatively flat year-over-year, we will no longer call it out as nonrecurring as it becomes a permanent component of our run rate. Other swing factors include potential changes in Medicare Advantage enrollment and potential costs associated with initiating value-based care contracts. A few additional items. Since our second quarter earnings call, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of our common stock, so our share count as of today is approximately 112 million. For your EPS modeling, you also need to consider the dilutive impact from outstanding equity awards, which in the third quarter was approximately 3 million shares. Finally, as a result of lower LIBOR rates and interest expense from debt financing that we have completed this year, we expect quarterly debt expense to be approximately $65 million in Q4. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess, maybe just starting off with the guidance commentary. I appreciate the headwinds, the tailwinds that you were discussing, which were really, I guess, about 2021. But just to be clear, in your double-digit EPS growth you've incorporated a reasonable assumption for all these headwinds and tailwinds in that double-digit growth assumption over the next couple of years. Javier Rodriguez : So yes, Kevin, we did. And I'd just point out that EPS guidance is multi-year. It's not for next year specifically, but yes, we have taken into account the headwinds and tailwinds that we pointed out. Kevin Fischbeck : And the base number, is that $735 million to $760 million? You mentioned a number of kind of onetime items in the quarter. I just want to make sure that you're saying that $735 million, $760 million is the base off of which to use that growth rate? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I think this year is a good base. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then, I guess, as far as MA goes, you didn't specifically - I don't think you mentioned it being a headwind or tailwind. I think you kind of just kind of mentioned it as an uncertainty. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on how MA is shaping up? And any update on the Humana contract? Joel Ackerman : Sure, Kevin. So there's a bunch of dynamics in that. So let me grab them one at a time. Number one, we continue to think that the enrollment in MA will be gradual, consistent to what we've said in other quarters. Number two, the open enrollment, it just started. And so we don't have anything to report on it. And even if we were further, we have very little visibility. So we will wait until basically January when we get the numbers. And then lastly, as it relates to Humana, there's a couple of things that I would say. Normally, we don't talk about individual accounts. But on this one, since it got public, I'll make a couple of statements. I think the broader question that we should address is, is there a big bolus or a wave of negotiations coming out of the MA? And the answer is no, Humana is the exception. We are comprehensively contracted across the MA book. And so we're in a good spot, and the majority of our portfolio is contracted beyond 12 months. As it relates to Humana specifically, they notified us of a nonrenewal. We're in a very constructive dialogue with them on a risk deal. And as you know, the risk deals take some time so we're negotiating with them, and we hope to get the issues resolved. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great. And then I guess just the last question for now. You mentioned in the quarter that commercial pricing was a headwind even though, I guess, it was a tailwind for the year-to-date. So I guess, what happened in the quarter? Is it a onetime item? Or is there something that we should be thinking about going on there? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, Kevin, it's much more of a onetime thing. I'd continue to focus on the full year-over-year rather than focus on the individual quarter. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. So you wouldn't expect that to be a Q4 impact as well? Javier Rodriguez : No. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Andrew Mok : Javier back in May, you mentioned that peak level of unemployment matters more than the shape of the recovery. We're now at the end of October and peak unemployment, at least the headline number is likely behind us. How does that peak number, combined with the internal data you see on COBRA uptake, shape your thinking on the potential impact that commercial mix may have on your business in 2021? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. I don't know when the peak will be on unemployment. So what we have seen from our patients is that they have been incredibly resilient about trying to keep their job and their coverage. So we are very happy with where we are right now in mix as it relates to where we were a couple of quarters ago, meaning it's held up. But then, of course, we don't know where the - which direction the pandemic will go and how the labor markets will go. But that is - right now, where we stand today, we are in a stronger position than I thought last quarter. Andrew Mok : Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, can you help us quantify the impact on treatment growth between patient mortality from COVID and slowing referral sources? Joel Ackerman : Sure, Andrew. It's Joel here. I'll take that one. So we - as you look at the impact on NAG of COVID, there are really 5 things that we think about : mortality, transplants, missed treatments, acute and new patient starts. And if you go back last quarter, mortality was the biggest headwind and then transplants and missed treatments were small tailwinds. And acutes and new starts were small headwinds. The four things other than mortality have really played through, and they've either diminished or they've reversed and as we see it now, obviously, things could change, but largely, those things are not playing through for NAG going forward. So it's largely a mortality story. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : I wanted to follow-up first on the 2021 headwinds and tailwinds. Just trying to think about, when you look at COVID, you talked about it could be a significant headwind next year. But you do have the lack of advocacy costs to kind of offset that. Do you look at those right now as being neutral, an overall headwind or an overall tailwind, without giving too many specifics. Joel Ackerman : I'd say, Justin, it's too early to tell. There's really a lot of uncertainty about what COVID has in-store for us for 2021. So I don't think we're in a position right now to give a sense of order of magnitude. Justin Lake : Okay. But we know the lack of advocacy causes the tickets or the $0.50 number that you talked about. You're saying these COVID costs could be that much or more, depending on what happens over the next few months into next year? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So look, you have to think about COVID along a few different dimensions. There's the direct costs. Those could remain flat, they could go down, they could go up theoretically as well. I'd say a lot of uncertainty there. They're the offsets and from where we stand right now, the Medicare - the sequestration relief is going to go away unless something new happens there, and that will clearly be a headwind. The savings we've experienced on benefits is likely to be a headwind as well as our teammates start going back and getting the care that they need. And then T&E is a question mark. So that's some of the impact around the cost and the offset numbers. And then what you've got to add to that is the impact on volume. And remember, that accumulates. So the impact from Q2 plus Q3 will likely be - it will continue to be a headwind till those declines anniversary, and that will take a while. And then the impact on mix is unknown. As Javier said, it's been a lot better than we ever expected. But we don't know what COVID has in-store for the economy going forward. Justin Lake : Okay. And then you mentioned mix. I think it was in the release, you said mix trended down in the third quarter versus Q2, or against you. Can you give some more color in terms of how much mix change you saw there? Javier Rodriguez : I'll grab that, Justin. There's not a lot that stood out on mix. So I'm not sure what we - what you're shining there, but there's nothing that I would point to that's relevant for your model. Justin Lake : Okay. Maybe I misread that. And then last question, just another follow-up on Kevin's question on Humana. The - so if at you're at a network, I know you're having a conversation with them, but they are at a network for 2021. You've already told us it's going to be slow, steady growth in Medicare Advantage. Can - do you think it's - I know some of this is going to depend on whether you retain members, and I think Humana might have been paying you a little more than average, at least according to them. So when you net it all out, do you think it's possible that Medicare Advantage could still be a positive, meaning it will grow enough to offset the Humana losses? Or do you think this ends up being more like a neutral or maybe even a headwind given that - when you net it all together? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I mean, obviously, there's a couple of pieces there. Number 1 is enrollment and do we get it right, that it is gradual. I think, again, we will get that right. As it relates to the contracting, as I said, we're comprehensively contracted. So we think that we've got it in the right box. And again, depending on Humana, it's a decent-sized player. I think it's embedded in our guidance, but I don't think it's going to be anything that sticks out in your model as a big up or down. So those variables will move in a band that won't - I don't anticipate will be too big. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Clive from Bernstein. Lisa Clive : Two questions, yes. Just following up on the previous question. You did mention on the revenue, there was - that the quarterly change was primarily due to a decrease in commercial revenue per treatment. You mentioned that was really sort of one-off, unfavorable changes in seven government payer mix. So that was sort of particularly oddly phrased and then a decline in calcimimetics, which was sort of as expected. So I just wanted to circle back to make sure there's nothing sort of going on in patient mix. And particularly, if there was a bit of a headwind, that would sort of be odd given that I understand that the mortality that you're seeing amongst COVID patients is mainly elderly patients. So if anything, it would be a slight tailwind to patient mix. And then - so just some clarification on that would be great. And then the second question, for your extra COVID costs around your teammates, what proportion or sort of how much of that was for child care and that - could that possibly decrease, notably now that schools are back in person for the most part, and hopefully will continue to be. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So Lisa, let me grab the RPT one. The government stuff is a seasonal thing that happens typically in Q3 around reenrollment in Medicare. In terms of the commercial side, you are right that COVID is a small - a small tailwind that helps our commercial mix to some extent. Because mortality is differentially impacting older patients who are more likely to have Medicare. Javier Rodriguez : The second part was around the cost of child care? Lisa Clive : Yes. Javier Rodriguez : I think it's going to be fascinating to see what happens with the schools. I don't know, my kids and what I'm hearing from our teammates is that it's been very fluid. We've had a wide range from people that have been staying at home the whole time to all the way to full-time in school and somewhere in between. There's been positive starts and finishes. So what we're trying to do is support our teams and create the resources so that they can go to work. And so we've got some safety nets and different programs that we're funding. And we hope that we have them covered. Of course, if this gets materially worse and we go back to a really acute shutdown, everybody will be in the same pickle. So we prepared for that. And again, it's all in the bandwidth of how this pandemic behaves. Lisa Clive : Okay. So it sounds like people still do need the extra support. So it's not - it probably isn't - the costs probably aren't decreasing on your end at this point. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Lisa, I mean, look, the different parts of the country are at different ways of handling the education system. And so we're seeing different pockets of expenses and demand and constraints on our teammates and how they're handling their child care. So it's been bumpy and regional. Joel Ackerman : Yes. More broadly, I'd say, as we think about the COVID impact on Q4, our expectations, is it a look closer to what we saw in Q2 than Q3, and it's likely to be a negative rather than the positive we saw in Q3. Javier Rodriguez : Sorry, just to clarify that encompasses everything, right. That is not the narrow lens of education. Operator : And our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Philip Chickering : A few questions for you on the fourth quarter guidance. It looks like in third quarter, you had a 15% operating income margin despite the $66 million of advocacy costs and you're guiding to margin declines in the fourth quarter. Can you just help me sort of quantify what is implied within the fourth quarter margin and a little more detail on the positive COVID impact you had in the third quarter? I was a little unclear on that. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So for Q4, I think there are 2 things driving it. First is COVID. And as I just mentioned, we saw COVID was, call it, $20 million to $30 million positive to OI in Q3. For Q4, we're expecting something more like what we saw in Q2. So a large reversal. And so that's the biggest driver of the Q4 decline over Q3. We're also anticipating some seasonal and other stuff that will likely drive the more - the kind of the underlying earning power for Q4 down a bit, but COVID is the biggest driver of the margin decline that we talked about. In terms of Q3, as it relates to COVID, what you really see there is a bunch of positive impacts to the P&L associated with COVID. The ones I'd call out most are the sequestration, suspension, lower T&E, lower benefit costs. And the direct cost that we saw in Q2 largely went away, not completely went away, but to a large extent, went away. And the result was the offsets were larger than the direct cost, and that's why COVID was a net positive for the quarter. Philip Chickering : Okay. So and if we take the midpoint of your fourth quarter operating guidance, let's say, $420 million, we - I think that for 2021, add in the $50 million of COVID swing. I mean, the sort of the core run rate here should be in the $470 million range. If we annualize that, is that how we should be thinking of that from a base running into 2021? Or just assuming that COVID slows down? Or is there anything that would sort of skew that logic one way or another way? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So look, COVID, there's a lot of uncertainty about COVID in Q4. So I don't want to get overly precise. But if you're looking for a jump-off point for modeling next year, I think full year, adjusting for the 3 big items, which are calcimimetics, ballot initiatives and COVID, is the right way to think about the starting point for a model for next year. I will point out, as I said calcimimetics. But remember, we've called out calcimimetics as roughly flat in 2021 versus 2020. The reason I call it out is because in 2020, we viewed it as nonrecurring. In 2021, it will be a recurring part of ROI. Philip Chickering : Okay. And then one more follow-up question for you. We're hearing that home dialysis is continuing to accelerate. Is there any way to help quantify what the operating margin leverage is for every 100 basis points of patients who move from a center into home? How much of a margin impact is that to your bottom line? Joel Ackerman : Yes. We haven't given that number. It's a very complicated question, and it moves over time. It depends which patients are moving from in-center to home. So we've generally shied away from trying to put a specific number on that. Philip Chickering : But overall, it is a - the move to the home overall as a net operating margin improvement for you, correct? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with UBS. Benjamin Mayo : Let me follow-up on that last question just a different way. What's the difference in the nonacquired treatment growth profile of in-clinic versus home? I know home is growing much faster as Pito alluded to. But if we stripped out the home, what would the in-clinic growth rate look like? Joel Ackerman : Sorry, Whit, I'm struggling - well, first of all, it's a hard number to give in the context of COVID, where NAG is moving around so much. Are you asking now? Or are you asking in kind of pre-COVID? Benjamin Mayo : Pre-COVID. Joel Ackerman : What we've historically said is that the home is growing about 5x faster than in center. Benjamin Mayo : Okay. Well, maybe just follow-up on maybe kind of a rule of thumb to think about the conversion of in-clinic and home. Javier Rodriguez : I'm sorry, was I not asked? Benjamin Mayo : No, I guess I'm just trying to kind of - if we're growing, let's say, 1% at the enterprise level on NAG. And home is growing 8% or 10%. And I guess, we can follow-up. It's fine. I may have missed this earlier, but what was one-time about the commercial revenue decline in the quarter? Was this normal payer settlements that just went against you? Joel Ackerman : Just normal fluctuations, nothing worth noting, nothing that I think will recur in any way or has any impact on how to think about our commercial rate going forward. Benjamin Mayo : Okay. And maybe one more, just - I don't know if you gave this already and I missed it, but the calcimimetics RPT and the cost per treatment. Joel Ackerman : I have not given those, but I've got them handy. Hold on 1 second. So for Q3, RPT for calcimimetics was $6.31 and for - and cost per treatment were $4.31. So if you think about the OI from calcimimetics in Q3, it was about $15 million. Benjamin Mayo : Okay. And the expectation maybe for the fourth quarter, I know we've got ASP down a bunch. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So we've called out $50 million to $70 million would be at the high end of the range. I think we can continue to think we'll be near the high end of the range. We might actually be a little bit above it. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary Taylor : Joel, maybe just going back to the home versus in-center. You said it was a complicated question. So I'm going to ask it a little more complicated fashion. When you talk about the home incremental margin, is that percentage or dollars? And when you think about a center that's up and running and the contribution of an incremental patient versus sort of a fully loaded patient, does that change how you think about the answer? And then does PD or home hemo change how you answer the question? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So it's true for both percentage and dollars. In terms of the other things you cited, all those things factor in. They're into it as does treatment, as does commercial mix and a bunch of other things. Gary Taylor : Okay. I think that's helpful. I think I understand which way those swing. I was just looking on advocacy costs, $66 million in the quarter. Those were immaterial in the 2Q, I think? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Gary Taylor : Is that right? And a year ago, third quarter of '19, I would have thought they were material. I couldn't find them in my notes. If you don't have them handy, I'll follow up. Joel Ackerman : So Gary, as a reminder, we think about our advocacy costs in 2 buckets. There's about a $30 million number that recurs year after year. And that's really not what we're referring to. That's baked into all our other numbers. This is the advocacy specifically related to Prop 23, the California ballot initiative, which happened in 2018. So there was nothing in 2019. It's - right now, it's an even year issue. Gary Taylor : Okay. Just two more quick ones, if I could. You haven't really talked about ETC very much, and you didn't cite it in your headwinds, tailwinds. How are you thinking about treatment choices next year? Javier Rodriguez : Gary, thank you. I'll grab that. The EPC came out, cleared out some things, made some improvements, which we're very appreciative to the administration that they heard from the community. We're going to obviously work really hard to meet their objectives because they're aligned with our objectives, which is to get more people to the right modality and to make sure that as many people as possible can get transplant. If you're looking for something as to what to plug into your model, the reality is it's a bit early, but I'm going to use CMS and what they said. They said that it would be a saver of $34 million over 6 years. And so - and that's for the entire industry. So if you grab 1/3 of that. And so my understanding is, it's a little more forgiving on the front end and then it grabs a little more on the back end. But as you can see, the numbers are digestible. Gary Taylor : Got it. And then last one, any thoughts around how DaVita might eventually participate in CMS direct contracting? In a lot of ways, at the surface, that sounds like exactly what you've been asking for, for CMS for your patient population for a long time. So it does seem like potentially, there'd be - I don't know how you play out in terms of passive enrollment, but it seems like there would be an opportunity to do some voluntary enrollment potentially in your population. I'm sure you guys have probably looked at it. Any high-level thoughts on it? Javier Rodriguez : Well, you're absolutely right that we continue to explore every option. We continue to go after Kidney Care Act, and we are evaluating all of these voluntary models. They come out with rules as we go, and so they're quite dynamic. And so one day, we're very excited about one format and then the rules come out, and it is either disappointing or harder for us to participate in it. And so we continue to evaluate it, and we will get back to you once everything is finalized. Yesterday, actually, for the voluntary model, the financial structure came out. It's roughly 100 pages. And so we're still digesting it, but we'll be back to you when we have a conclusion. Operator : And our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. John Ransom : Good evening, everybody. Just kind of stepping back and asking maybe a bigger question. I mean, it would seem like the incentives are aligned between MA plans taking capitation from Medicare and then working with you to capitate these high-risk patients. And certainly, you had 8 years' experience with DaVita Medical capitation. I guess it's just not clear to me. Are we going to be stuck in this fee-for-service land 5,000 years from now? Is this just going to move, like, glacially? Or what's the impediment for getting this into a more global discussion? Because it seems like we're just stuck where we were 5, 10 years ago in terms of like 99.9% of your revenue still being just fee-for-service, and you have these food fights over $1 here, $1 there. I mean, just what's your perspective there? Javier Rodriguez : Thanks, John. Well, we agree with you that there's a big movement right now. There's appetite, there's momentum, there's a lot of interest. These deals are a lot more complicated to do, setting up the baseline, setting up the incentives, so they're multiyear, so we can do the investment. But to your point, it's taken a while, but I think there is an intersection point right now of momentum. So it takes 2 to tango. And it feels like the other side is willing and we are ready. And so I think over the next couple of years, you're going to see a lot more of these deals come across. John Ransom : Great. And then my other question is just if you go back to your last Analyst Day when you laid out your targets, I mean, there's obviously been a lot of noise with COVID and some temporal factors. But if we step back and look at what you thought then and what we think has changed structurally in the business, what would you point out that has changed either positive or negative as we think about the earnings power of DaVita? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So I'll take that. Fundamentally, we've made a lot more margin progress than we thought quicker than we thought we could and part of that comes from RPT, part of that comes from cost management. On the RPT side, I wouldn't point to anything specific. There's some mix in there. There's some rate, both commercial and Medicare that has improved bad debt. So it's pretty broad-based. And similarly, on the cost side, I think we've done a great job on productivity. We continue to see benefits. On the pharma side, we've managed some of the non-people costs in the clinics extremely well. So overall, driving the OI margin has been important. And then below the OI line, our interest costs are way down, and we bought back more stock faster than we thought we would. So there's no magic bullet in there. It's pretty balanced across the income statement, but we're super proud. I think the results have been strong, and we're really excited with where we are right now. John Ransom : And if we were just to think, like, in the old world, if mix were the same and the world was the same as it was, are you still having scarcer fights over commercial contracts and revenue per treatment? And we're not talking about Medicare. Or have we sort of gotten past the period of contentiousness and some of these unfortunate negotiations years ago? Joel Ackerman : Well, John, I mean, to be honest with you, it's weird what analysts and others hear. Because at the end of the day, the negotiation tends to be quite constructive and productive most of the time, and maybe it's that you hear of the outliers that are really contentious. But on average, we all try to get to the same output, which is can we deliver more for the patients? Can we offer the best network? And can we bring it in, in a way that flattens or improves the cost curve? And so we all sit down with the same goals in mind. And then just sometimes, it happens to be that people either us perceived as getting greedy or them perceived as being greedy. So there's not a meeting of the mind. But if you go back and do an inventory of how many of those were so contentious and drawn out, you can count them in your hand. And so maybe we just tend to remember them because they are so visible. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Matthew Larew : Joel, maybe I want to take one more swing at sort of the COVID dynamics 3Q to 4Q. And appreciate the attempt to quantify it. This is challenging. But just directionally, I'm still trying to make sense in my head which of those factors would be reversing in terms of the impact from a positive negative standpoint from Q3 to Q4? And maybe just at least understanding which items you're expecting reversal might help. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So it's a little bit more on the direct cost side. It's a little bit more impact from the treatment volume decline, and it's a little bit from reductions in the offset. So it's coming from all three of those buckets. Matthew Larew : Okay. And then Javier, interesting update on the Kidney Smart platform and some good metrics there. Just curious, where are you seeing the most adoption? And then just would be curious what maybe your economics, if any, look like when you're partnering with folks to provide that platform? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. The economics are not there. So it's free and access to all the community. And so the - anyone could get it. And the whole hope there is, of course, that people can transition to modality planning, in many instances just get mentally acclimated to the lifestyle change that you're going to have. And so it is just literally a gift to the community and hopefully helps people transition into what is likely to be a very big lifetime lifestyle change. And so we're very proud of it. It's - if you've ever gone in, it's very comprehensive but easy to understand. And we think it's making a real impact in the community. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Just a couple of follow-up questions here. I appreciate you breaking down the guidance for EPS a little bit, but maybe you could break down the building blocks a little bit more. The operating income growth, is there a way to think about how much is revenue growth versus continued margin expansion from here? Because you're already above what you targeted for your 2022 margins. So just trying to figure out if there's more room to grow there. Joel Ackerman : Yes, Kevin, I think it's a bit early for us to get into that level of detail. It can obviously play out in different ways over time, depending on some industry dynamics. It could also depend on some capital allocation dynamics. So I think we're going to stick with just OI and EPS. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then other question just being, you talked about - you're talking to Humana about doing a capitated type contract and - or value-based contract, I guess. And that, broadly speaking, there's a lot more interest in doing these types of things. How should we think about the profitability of these types of contracts? Not specifically Humana, but just in general, like when you enter DaVita, is the expectation that you would be doing it as a way to kind of maintain the current economics that you have on those patients? Or is there a view that since you're taking risk, you should be paid more and maybe making more off that patient for inherently taking risk on top of just the fee-for-service structure from the past. Joel Ackerman : Yes. I mean it's a fair question, Kevin. And the reality is that there's - it's not a simple answer. The starting point matters and the baseline of the structure of matters and then in some of these, you have to invest upfront to get the returns on the back end. And so there's not a smooth easy answer to that. But in general, I think what we're all trying to do here is bend the cost curve. And then if we can create a bigger pool for us to play in and participate in that hopefully we can participate in that. But it takes some investment upfront. And so that's how I think about it. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And I guess in the past, you've had issues with some of the way the government structures have been, where you kind of have this consistent adjustment to the baseline. As you deliver saving, your reimbursement gets cut. That's been where some of the prior demos have worked. My assumption is that the conversations with managed care are more amenable, I guess, in their structure that they're kind of more tied to the overall MA rate rather than to the savings that you deliver? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Usually in MA, of course, you have risk adjustment. And so on that, you get to acclimate to the patient there and how sick they are. And in the other government programs, it's been a little black box-ish. And then all of a sudden, at the end of the program and then after X amount of month, you find out that you were rebased. So it just makes it really hard to forecast how aggressively you want to invest, and that's been the biggest challenge that we've had with the government programs. And the opposite goes for MA that you could actually understand your risk, you can understand your level of investment in the upside and downside. Operator : Lisa Clive from Bernstein. Lisa Clive : Just one follow-up question about home dialysis. Perhaps a different way of thinking about it, the profit impact is, is there a notable difference in the length of time that a patient stays on their private insurance when they're in the clinic versus at home? I imagine if they're doing home dialysis, they can stay employed. So does that materially impact the number of months that they actually stay privately insured? Javier Rodriguez : The short answer is no, that there's nothing magical about home versus private insurance. There's a preselection bias maybe that more people that work will pick home. And so if you might recall from capital markets, the other thing that's really important to remember is that roughly 85% of our patients that dialyze at home, dialyze in a center at some point. And so either on the front end or on the back end or even during their care. And so we've always debated on some of these dynamics that you're trying to get to economically or length of private pay, et cetera. Is it because of the modality? Or is it because of the patient that pick the modality? And we don't know. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Thank you, Michelle. Let me make a couple of closing comments. Well, it goes without saying, it is a challenging environment out there. And so I just want to thank again the dedication, the caring and the professionalism of our teams. It has really energized our entire organization. Secondly, we've delivered on the commitments that we made to you ahead of schedule, and we are really well positioned to deliver on our multiyear earnings growth. Stay safe, and thank you for your interest in DaVita. Operator : And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any subsequent filings we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thanks Jim. Good afternoon and thank you for joining the call today to discuss our 2020 performance and thoughts on 2021. For DaVita, 2020 showcased our caregivers and their commitment to patients with kidney disease. COVID created challenges that we could never have imagined one year ago. These challenges clinical, operational, and financial led to opportunities for us to harness the strength of our teams and our platforms to support our patients and our community. When I reflect on the year, three things particularly stand out. First, our caregivers\u2019 team's focus on health and safety of our patients; second, the creativity and innovation showed by our organization to adopt to the changing landscape; and third, the love, empathy, and dedication of our teams to each other and to our patients. Despite the good work in 2020, the challenges of COVID remain. The latest surge has been particularly difficult for our patients and our care teams. The disproportionate impact COVID has on patients with underlying health issues and the elderly continues to manifest itself in the dialysis community. The high rates of patient mortality that we talked about last quarter, unfortunately accelerated in November and continued through January. We estimate that our patient census at the end of 2020 was approximately 7,000 less than what it would have been otherwise absent COVID. As we look to the future, some leading indicators such as fewer new COVID cases, fewer hospitalizations, and the recent vaccination efforts give us hope. This leads me to our clinical focus on vaccine. Over the past few months, we've been engaging with the federal government, with state agencies, and the CDC to identify ways for our caregivers and patients to gain access to the vaccine. We are uniquely positioned to administer vaccine safely and efficiently in our clinics given our infrastructure, our clinical expertise delivering flu vaccines each year, and our ability to monitor patients' health each week. Our conversations with the CDC and federal government are ongoing and we're getting set up in their direct vaccine distribution system to be ready to start the moment we get the green light. In states like Minnesota and several large counties across California where we have been able to secure direct allocation, vaccination rates are as high as 70%, both because we have access but also because general accepted rates are higher when patients see other patients receiving the vaccine. Across much of the rest of the country, the logistics are signing up and the access at separate vaccine sites has been challenging for many patients. Therefore, our ultimate goal remains to obtain direct allocation from the federal government. Now, on to our financial performance. Despite the challenges of COVID, we significantly outperformed our original financial guidance for 2020. And we knew it would be a tough year to deliver profit growth given the headwinds from calcimimetic revenue decline and the cost of fighting the ballot initiative in California. When COVID hit, [indiscernible] growth only increased as COVID created significant uncertainty on our financial results. Despite this uncertainty, we grew our adjusted operating income by double digits, absent the impact of calcimimetics, ballot cost, and net COVID impact. We delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 34% and generated free cash flow from continuing operations of almost $1.2 billion, while returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our share buyback. In Q4 specifically, we experienced a net COVID impact of approximately $60 million, which was higher than we expected. Through the first three quarters of the year, the net COVID impact was reduced as the increased costs associated with COVID were offset by lower benefits, travel, and G&A spend. In Q4, we saw an accelerated impact of higher mortality coming out of the holiday season combined with fewer offsets in benefits and G&A expenses. The result was a negative COVID impact that was roughly $35 million higher than what we anticipated, bringing our Q4 earnings below the guidance range we provided last quarter. Excluding this increased COVID impact in Q4, our earnings would have been in the middle of our guidance range. As we look ahead to the coming year, our guidance range will be $7.75 to $8.75 per share, which incorporates our expected impact of COVID and demonstrates our belief in the underlying earnings growth of our business. We believe that our core performance in 2020 creates a solid foundation for us to deliver on the long-term financial goals. Before I hand it over to Joel to cover our quarter and our outlook in greater detail, let me touch briefly on our recent Medicare Advantage enrollment. As a reminder, 2021 is the first year in which existing dialysis patients have the option to enroll in the Medicare Advantage plan. Previously, MA coverage for ESRD had been limited only to patients already enrolled in MA plans before kidney failure or to certain patients in MA Special Needs Plans. By the end of 2020, the percentage of our Medicare patients who were enrolled in MA plans was approaching 30%. And based on our preliminary enrollment data, we now expect our percentage of MA patients among Medicare patients to be in the mid-30s in 2021, which is still below the national average. As you would expect, the new enrollment was predominantly for Medicare patients previously without secondary coverage, because these patients will benefit from the expanded benefit of MA and the cap on out-of-pocket expenses. The growth in the ESRD MA population created opportunities for us to build additional momentum toward value-based care that we've been investing. This is an exciting trend and we're eager to lead the way with our payer and nephrology partners to deliver comprehensive care to our patients, which we believe will help lead to better clinical outcomes and lower overall cost of care. Our 2021 guidance range reflects our expected cost and investments to build our model of care for our value-based agreement. Now let me hand it over to Joel. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. I'll begin with some additional color on our Q4 results and then focus on our 2021 guidance. Our full year 2020 results exceeded our initial expectations, and the core earnings power of the business remains strong. However, our Q4 results reflect the strong headwinds from the latest COVID surge. Operating income was $382 million and earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.67 below the guidance from our last earnings call. The middle of our adjusted EPS guidance range contemplated a net headwind from COVID of approximately $25 million. However, as Javier referenced, the actual impact was approximately $60 million. Excluding the impact of COVID, our EPS from continuing operations would have been in the middle of our adjusted guidance range. Relative to Q3, we experienced changes in first, mortality which has had a compounding effect throughout the year; second, a reduction in expense offsets in the quarter particularly related to the healthcare costs for our teammates which have helped to temper the net financial impact of COVID in Q2 and then in Q3; and third higher direct costs related to COVID including certain benefits to help our frontline teammates with the hardships of COVID and higher PPE costs. Other than COVID, notable factors for the quarter include non-acquired growth of negative 0.3% due to the monthly mortality trend worsening during the quarter. Revenue per treatment was up in the quarter as a result of normal fluctuations in Medicare reimbursement and seasonality. Patient care costs increased sequentially, primarily due to various impacts of COVID that I previously mentioned; G&A decreased sequentially, primarily due to the elimination of ballot cost; and we saw continued core profit in our international business offset by a $6 million foreign exchange loss. In the fourth quarter, we purchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock. And additionally to date in 2021, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares. So our share count as of today is approximately 109 million. When estimating our diluted share count in your models, you need to consider the dilutive impact of EPS of outstanding equity awards, which in the fourth quarter was approximately 4.3 million shares. Looking forward to 2021. As you can see in the press release, our guidance for adjusted operating income is $1.675 billion to $1.825 billion, adjusted earnings per share is $7.75 to $8.75 and free cash flow is $900 million, $1.15 billion. Our guidance ranges are wider than in a typical year. This is the result of the wide range of potential impact of COVID on our 2021 results. At the midpoint of our range, we have incorporated an estimate of the net cost associated with COVID of approximately $200 million. Declining treatment volume as a result of higher mortality is the primary driver of the growing impact relative to 2020.  Our guidance assumes that the higher mortality will continue for the first half of 2021 and return closer to pre-COVID levels in the second half of the year as a result of widespread use of effective vaccine. However, COVID does introduce a significantly higher level of uncertainty in our forecast and there are certain scenarios that could result in our performing outside this range.  Looking through the impact of COVID, we believe that 2021 will be another year of solid underlying operating income growth with strong free cash flow and we expect to continue to invest in our strategy and in innovation. Let me now provide a few additional details on our outlook. Ballot cost should be a significant year-over-year tailwind as we spent approximately $67 million in 2020 to defeat the ballot initiative in California. As 2021 is not a general election year, we do not expect this expense to occur.  Calcimimetics should be relatively flat year-over-year, although the quarterly contribution will be evenly spread throughout 2021 rather than the declining trend we experienced in 2020. Now that calcimimetics has become a permanent component of our Medicare run rate, we will no longer call out the financial impact going forward. Other swing factors include the benefit from increasing Medicare Advantage enrollment offset by our investment in our value-based program. These investments include G&A costs associated with enhancing our model of care and start-up costs associated with new contracts.  A few more quick notes on 2021. We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be similar to our 2020 spend. A reminder that our current run rate interest expense is $60 million to $65 million per quarter. We expect tax rates to remain between 26% and 28% absent any material changes from the new administration. And as usual, Q1 has two fewer treatment days in Q4 and higher bad debt and payroll taxes. Year-over-year, Q1 will have 0.6 fewer treatment days than last year because of the leap year.  With that operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate the details there. I wanted to kind of follow-up on 2021 and just make sure kind of I understand some of the moving parts here first. So Joel you said, $200 million from COVID. Is that comparable to -- my math is $60 million this year when I add sequestration in the COVID costs and all the other savings from COVID together? So that would be [multiple speakers? Joel Ackerman : Yes and I'll remind everyone that there's a lot of uncertainty associated with COVID. So we tried to be helpful by focusing on a scenario in the middle of our range. But yes, the $200 million is apples-to-apples with a roughly $60 million number from 2020. Justin Lake : Okay. And so the mortality is the remainder of that $140 million. And then on Medicare Advantage, were you saying the costs are an offset? Does that mean Medicare Advantage overall is a net kind of wash or is there still some benefit from Medicare Advantage and any color you can add to that in terms of how meaningful it is would be helpful. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So the way I think about the MA is the penetration rate went up call it 5%, a couple of percent is what we would normally see in a typical year and 3% is the result of the Cures Act and the fact that some of our patients had access for the first time, and we think about the upside from that 3% and that's in the same range as the excess spending we're doing in 2021 related to the growth of our value-based contract business, what we call IKC or Integrated Kidney Care. So a positive from that extra 3% and an investment related to Integrated Kidney Care and those two things are roughly in the same ballpark. So think of those as a wash in terms of impact on 2021 OI growth. Justin Lake : Got it. And then last question for me. I mean, I've been covering the stock a long time and I've always struggled to think about the decremental margins on lost membership or revised [ph] membership patients, right, in patients that have treatments. And I assume the mortality is probably more focused on the Medicare side number one. Can you confirm that to me? And then secondly can you help us understand like -- it's really helpful $140 million, but how much revenue you're losing there so we can kind of try to understand the decremental margin on that lost business and maybe think about as things normalize what that could be going forward? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So, first let me just clear up -- you keep using the $140 million. Let me clear up how we're thinking about the $200 million. And in many ways mimics what we saw in 2020. I would bucket our COVID impact into three categories. One is the direct costs associated with COVID and think of enhanced benefits we're giving to teammates to help them with the hardship associated with COVID, think of increased PPE spend. So that's bucket one. Bucket two are the offsets, lower T&E, the Medicare sequestration revenue, lower benefits as a self-insured employer. And what we saw in 2020 is those were big numbers, but they generally offset each other. It wasn't true quarter-to-quarter and that's why you see some of the big swing from Q3 to Q4. But if you look at the full year, those two numbers offset each other and the net impact in 2020 was the result of this accumulating lost treatments associated with some of our patients passing away as a result of COVID. So you can think of $60 million as the impact in 2020 associated with mortality. That $60 million in the scenario we laid out grows to $200 million next year. And again in 2021, we're anticipating more or less that the increased costs will be offset by the offsets, although the costs will come down and the offsets will come down, and the nature of the cost will be a little bit different. PPE we anticipate will remain elevated as the unit cost of some of the PPE stays high. Obviously, we'll keep the sequestration for Q1, but that will go away. We think T&E will remain low, but the health benefits associated with teammates will come down. So, again, direct costs and offsets blend to roughly zero and the $200 million is the impact from mortality. Now let me get to your fundamental question. Two things. Yes, the patients who are passing away from COVID are older on average than our average patient. And as a result, they're more likely to have Medicare and the commercial mix there is lower. In terms of thinking about the -- how it impacts our cost structure, it's tough to model. It depends on where these patients are how long it takes, over what period this extends, but it is safe to say that our G&A, you can think of it as relatively fixed and our patient care costs are -- a majority of our patient costs are variable. Justin Lake : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. To Justin's question if we take the midpoint of guidance and add $200 million to it, the back half of the year is typically over 40 -- 50% of your operating income for the year, so does that mean the operating income for the back half of the year should be above $975 million? Joel Ackerman : No. Well, are you saying excluding COVID? Pito Chickering : Correct. Correct. Because like you said that COVID is impacting in the first half of the year and then minimal in the back half of the year, so I was just curious and kind of help me think about the back half of the year sort of excluding COVID or even actually within your assumptions kind of how the back half of the year operating income should be? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So let me clarify what we meant by the front half of the year. What we were saying in the scenario we're painting there is that the lost -- the increased mortality that we are seeing in our patient population as a result of COVID would be highly concentrated in the front half of the year, that though the lost treatments associated with those patients who unfortunately have passed away early that remains through the back half of the year. And unfortunately will remain through 2022. So those treatments are lost. And what you would see in the back half of the year is you'd hopefully you'd see NAG bottoming out and starting to increase in the back half of the year, but it will take some time for the lost treatments to play through the system. So I don't think you can say the back half of the year will not be impacted by COVID, it certainly will be impacted by COVID. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then that's a nice segue for the 2021 guidance. Can you help us -- because you didn't provide revenue guidance, can you just help us think about sort of where first quarter treatment growth will be and then where you're modeling the ranges of fourth quarter treatment growth to be? Has the incidence of the ESRD returned to normalized levels and are you seeing some modest tailwinds from the lack of kidney transplants? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So if you think about all the other factors that impact NAG in terms of treatment and volume -- in terms of transplant volume and new to ESRD admits that stuff has largely returned to normal. So we're not anticipating much impact of that. So the NAG story for 2021 is largely around the mortality question. If you think about Q1 and I'll talk in terms of the NAG, we see NAG continuing to decline in Q1 and then again in Q2. And this is really driven by this scenario we painted of increasing mortality. And then it's hard to know where it will bottom out. Again there's a lot of uncertainty here. But in terms of trying to see what the NAG might be in Q2, you could anticipate something as low as negative 2% or even negative 3% for that one quarter and that it will start to recover from there. If you thought about the full year 2021 NAG, again, we're not guiding to NAG but just to help you all think about this I think it's safe to think of a negative NAG for the full year certainly probably -- I think it's reasonable to model it as somewhere in the negative 1% to negative 2%. And then you don't see NAG really return -- remember NAG is a year-over-year number, so you wouldn't see it return to normal until mid-2022. And then the one other thing I'd point out about NAG is once the mortality has worked its way through the system in terms of -- on a quarterly basis, we're not seeing excess mortality and once you've had a full year for the lagging effect of NAG to play through then you would anticipate us having a bit of a tailwind associated with NAG. The unfortunate mortality that we've seen as a result of COVID should lead to a lower mortality over the next few years as a result of some of the patients who passed away of COVID would have otherwise passed away in 2022 or 2023, et cetera. So you'll certainly see a real headwind on NAG in 2021, you'd expect a bit of a hangover from that in 2022. But going forward from the back half of 2022, and again this is all caveated on our scenario, whereby, the vaccines work and our patients get access to them, you'd start seeing a NAG that would be higher than normal in the back half of 2022. And I apologize for how many numbers I'm throwing around than how confusing this can be. So if anything wasn't clear please follow-up. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Mok with Barclays. You may proceed. Andrew Mok : Hi, good afternoon. First, I wanted to follow-up on the MA discussion. Can you speak to some of the value-based arrangements that you were able to strike with your MA partners for 2021 both in terms of construct and materiality patient base? Javier Rodriguez : Andrew, let me grab that. The reality is that we have a lot of different structures. So if you look at just historically, we had the special need plans and then we added the ESCO models, which were the CMMI models those are now winding down. And then, of course, CMMI came up with new models. So in that we have the four choices that CMMI has and then we had the executive order. So that's on the government side there's a fair amount of innovation on the value base. On the commercial side we, of course, are now doing more with our MA partners. And so we structured anything from shared savings to something that looks a little more like a full cap. And so as you can see the menu is extensive. And the more important thing to grab out of it is that we're committed to moving to value-based and we're taking bite sizes to make sure that we can deliver on all the commitments that we're making. So that's why we're investing to make sure that we can deliver on whatever way the format comes. Is that helpful Andrew? Andrew Mok : Yes. Do you have a patient number in terms of mix in terms of what's in value-based arrangements today? Javier Rodriguez : We do, but that number is going to fluctuate dramatically because of the filing of all these government CMMI products. And so we are not sure how that whole process is going to play out since they start in April, and how many patients are going to enroll. So that will be the bulk and the largest size of it. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And can you comment more broadly on how the pandemic and excess mortality is influencing your strategy around patient clinic optimization and home dialysis more broadly? Do you see an acceleration in both of those initiatives playing out over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : I appreciate it. The short answer is no because the most important thing is that, we have the modality of choice for the patient and the physician, that think is appropriate for the right care. And so, that is first and foremost and the first thing that is considered. Secondly, of course, if there is an area that's severely impacted, we are looking at that to see what capacity is in those centers. And so, we're taking a close look at it. But as you can imagine, our centers are needed in most of these communities and it's something that we have to be very responsible of because if you have mortality, there's still other patients there. And as you know for a very long time, we've carried several hundred centers that have lost money. And then it's a very difficult decision one that we don't take lightly whether we close the center or not. Andrew Mok : Got it. And then just lastly, you mentioned that the vaccine rates are as high as 70% among your patients in some geographies. Do you have a vaccination rate for your total patient population today? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. The patient vaccine rate is low and the teammate vaccine rate is actually starting to get into the 40%. And we are working, as I said in the remarks very diligently with the government because our hope is that we can get direct allocation. If we were to use the flu -- the normal flu vaccine as an example, we get close to 90% across the entire cohort. And we do it in a very, very quick time period. And so we're making a case to the government. But of course, as you know and you've read, there's a lot of demand in a lot of different groups. And so we're trying to break through that line. Andrew Mok : Got it. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the MA investments. It sounds like it's going to offset the benefit from it this year. Are these investments ones that you need to kind of get in and then that business that book of business will become more profitable over time? Or are you making an investment and kind of assuming that, it will be another 5% or 10% patients ultimately moving in. So this is kind of an investment that you're going to need more MA patients to come in to actually kind of leverage and start to make a profit on. How should we think about the margin profile of MA patients over time that are in a capitated arrangement? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So there's a lot we're going to learn about that over the next few years Kevin, but I think low to mid-single digits is a reasonable margin. If you think about it as using a full cap kind of accounting approach on some of these, we don't take in all the revenue. So that plays with the margin. But in terms of margin per patient, you'd wind up at about the same dollar amount. Javier Rodriguez : Kevin, maybe let me pull up just a little because it might not be clear before kind of investments we're making for value based. And so, there's two categories that I think of. One is sort of G&A stuff, software model of care for non-ESRD things like diabetes, mental, health end of life, those type of models that would scale in different kinds of framework. And then there's a start-up cost for each individual contract that has a custom elements to it. So care models health assessments and other things that are specific to each contract. So hopefully that helps. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes. No that does. And I guess just to make sure, I'm clear about when you're talking about a little bit, so just given your point about the revenue. I think that the revenue on a typical dialysis patient in MA is about $96,000 at least in premiums, so are you talking about something like 85% of that number is kind of how you're thinking about the revenue? Or are there other adjustments that I'd have to make? Joel Ackerman : I would say, if I were trying to model that and again a lot of uncertainty going forward, I would think about us making a margin on the component of the cost that is not dialysis. So think of us as a medical manager, a value-based care deliverer on the call it two-thirds of that $90,000 that doesn't go to dialysis. The dialysis cost is relatively fixed. And so, I'd apply the margin number to that 60,000 number. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess the 7,000 patient impacts from mortality. I guess that's like about 3% treatments in the quarter. Does that mean that, you think that a normalized treatment growth for the business is now 3%? I mean, you guys have been doing more like 2% or even less kind of heading into COVID. Do you -- is that where you think things ultimately get back to post-COVID? Or are you kind of saying that those other dynamics have normalized, but only because of COVID and when COVID goes away those factors will come back in and lead to sub-three industry growth. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So Kevin, I appreciate the math you're trying to do which is use the loss treatment count to back into what our normal NAG would have been. It's a very tough piece of analysis to do. The 7,000 was an end of quarter number. So you can't just multiply that. It was actually a little bit more weighted towards November and December when the spike began. So I don't think you can back into a NAG number. Frankly, we're having trouble backing into it, because there is a lot of play in the question of excess mortality and which of these patients really passed away of COVID versus other things. So I'd avoid trying to interpolate to what our underlying NAG is. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. And then just last question. The guidance is as you mentioned a little bit wider than normal and I understand COVID creates a lot of uncertainty. Is it just really this mortality thing? Is that the thing that we should be watching most? Or are there other kind of major swing factors we should be keeping our eye on? Joel Ackerman : Well, I think there are a bunch of other swing factors that could impact the year. So, if I were to run down the list, obviously there's the effectiveness of the vaccine and the variance and that will play through on the mortality line. There's the potential economic impact of COVID and how that could play through with private pay mix. Early in the pandemic we talked a lot about that and we were very concerned about it. We've been very pleased with the resiliency, our patients have shown in terms of maintaining their coverage but I think you can't lose sight that PPE costs are something that remain a relatively dynamic issue less in terms of volume utilization and more in terms of price, additional government assistance is certainly a possibility extending the sequestration halt or something like that. So those are a few things I'd point out to keep your eye on. That said yes. The mortality question is certainly the one that is dominating our modeling for 2021. Kevin Fischbeck : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Clive : Hello, a few questions. Number one, just on the $200 million headwind from the incremental -- from the COVID mortality and I guess $140 million of that is incremental. Given your guidance it looks like you're pretty confident that you can sort of fully offset that at least at the midpoint of your OI guidance. I'm just trying to understand where this incremental cost savings is coming from because you've been a pretty sort of lean organization for a long time. So just trying to understand sort of what are the additional levers there, especially when you do expect NAG to be potentially even slightly down for the year? And then second question just on home modalities. Obviously, you have to just do what's best for each patient. But have you seen increased interest in home modality since the pandemic hit? And specifically as we think about the shift to home, whether it's PD or HD. Are you catching these patients early enough that it makes a difference in terms of whether they stay employed, potentially keep their private insurance, where they otherwise would have dropped their job and either gone into COBRA for a period of time or just switch directly into Medicare? I guess I'm really just trying to understand the longer-term impact on patient mix from a greater use of home? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So Lisa, let me take the first and I think Javier will grab the second one. So as I interpreted your question is what's the bridge from 2020 to 2021, given the headwind? And here's the way I think about it. If you take our non-GAAP or adjusted OI in 2021 and add back the $67 million for the ballot initiatives and then add back the $60 million for COVID and then you compare that to the middle of our range adding back COVID. So this -- so 19.50 [ph] you'd get about a 4% growth rate. And that's how I think about how is the core doing year-over-year. And to me 4% it's a solid, stable year of the core with this very challenging, very uncertain calcimimetic COVID on top of it. The 4%, it's kind of what our normal year would look like, low to mid single-digit revenue growth. Stable margins again driven by RPT increases below inflation. Good cost management. I talked about the MA and the IKC offsetting themselves. So that's how I think about the 4% growth. It's just -- it's a stable steady year masked by COVID. Javier Rodriguez : And Lisa let me grab the second part of that, which is on home modality. The short answer is we have a lot of excitement on the home modality, because it really enhances the quality of life. And so our physicians and our patients are responding quite well. And we are innovating a lot so that our patients when they're home, they the confidence in security as if they were in center. And so we're developing a lot of tools like remote monitoring and telehealth and other things so our patients can feel that security of doing dialysis at home. It does continue to grow in a significant way. And as it relates to getting the patients earlier and what does that have impact on mix. The short answer is that that's work in progress. We continue to work with our physician practices to make sure that they're educating the patients and then we've developed world-class free to anyone in the community that the access training, so that you can know your modality selection. And the hope is that, of course, you make your selection early enough so that you can have the transition without that big spike or without any depression or mental issues as you acclimate to dialysis. Lisa Clive : Okay. Thanks. And just one follow-up for Joel on the cost structure. Can you just remind us of where you are with your EPO contract with Amgen? I know you signed a long-term contract with them. When does that renew? And is that a potential avenue for lower costs? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So Lisa, the contract ends at the end of 2022. As you know, we've always been a little challenged as a result of confidentiality agreements in terms of what we can say. It will certainly be interesting times as that contract ends, regarding hips and some other dynamics. So, it remains to be seen what's going to happen then. Lisa Clive : Okay. Thanks for your time, and it\u2019s helpful. Javier Rodriguez : Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. Next we will hear from Whit Mayo with UBS. You may proceed. Whit Mayo : Thanks. Good afternoon. Back on the mortality dynamic, I was just thinking about hospitalizations that don't result in death and based off of some of the industry data that we've seen. I don't know if this is right or not, but it's got the rate of hospitalization maybe three to four higher than the death. And I know this is dangerous, but would imply maybe 20,000 of your patients could have been hospitalized around the same time that you experienced this higher mortality. And I can appreciate it's hard to parse out did COVID drive the mortality? Or was this another factor? But I'm just broadly kind of wanted to hear your -- what you're seeing with just overall hospitalizations and missed visits. I mean the numbers cumulatively are probably fairly low. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So, early in the pandemic, we actually saw a benefit from lower missed treatments, which you would suppose, is our patients avoiding the hospital. That has largely normalized. So isn't really playing through on the treatment numbers right now. I would remind you part of our platform. We have a decent-sized acute business and that has seen some benefits as a result of this. So -- but, in terms of the overall impact on the year, it's not significant. Whit Mayo : Right. I'll stop the mortality. I think that pretty much covers it. But maybe just one other question I had was, I think, you guys are back in network with Humana maybe technically you were never out of network. That's probably more the accurate statement, but just anything to share about that contract and maybe more broadly just an update on the network adequacy modifications. And any changes that you're seeing differently with how payers are behaving? Just kind of curious on that topic. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. Let me grab that one. This is Javier. I think the great outcome of the Humana negotiation is that we both ended up with our goals accomplished. Both Humana and DaVita wanted to have -- make sure that more patients had access that we were innovating and making sure that we were creating what we call the win-win arrangement that had better outcomes at a reduced cost. That unfortunately has a lot more complexity and takes a lot longer, because you have to do a lot of analytics to make sure that we're set up to be a win-win. In general the MA book, as we told you last time, is mostly contracted and has been for quite some time. The timing of the Humana contract just happened to be at the end of the year, and it was -- obviously because of its size, it's more complicated, but we're very happy with how it ended up and we're looking forward to a multi-year relationship that delivers on this value-based contract. Whit Mayo : Okay. And actually just one last one just not -- Joel, I don't think you want to give specific guidance around the quarters here. But, any way to think about what percent of your earnings you think you may have in the first half versus the second half? I'd hate for us all to get things terribly wrong with how you guys internally are looking at the cadence of earnings. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Look, Q1 is usually a weak quarter. We've got higher bad debt, higher payroll taxes, one other thing that's slipping my mind. But, I wouldn't -- but I'd say relative to last year it will be very different, because last year the calcimimetics number really skewed things as did the ballot initiative. Oh yes, there are fewer treatment days in Q1, sorry. But I don't think it will be dramatic. I don't think the pattern will be that different than a normal year. And given the fact that the mortality issues that we are raising will really spike in Q1 and then come down, it is not unreasonable to think of COVID as being relatively evenly spread across the year. Whit Mayo : Okay. So as I think about the first half versus the second half, are you saying we should apply like normal seasonal patterns looking back at 2019, 2018, 2017? We could look at that as a reasonable break between your first and second half? Joel Ackerman : I think if you're looking at the core yes you could look at historical reasonable patterns and how -- look COVID is uncertain enough over the course of the whole year, how it's going to play out quarter-by-quarter is hard to predict. We obviously saw that in Q4. But a relatively even spread across the year seems like a reasonable starting point for a very uncertain number. Javier Rodriguez : The big assumption there Whit is of course if the mortality is in the front end of the year then it continues to play out which is very different than what happened in 2020 which happened to be the spike ended up in the back end of the year. And so and analytically of course that is on the premise that the vaccines work and that the fourth quarter and the third quarter are -- look more normal than where we are now. Whit Mayo : Thanks for all the color. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open. John Ransom : Good evening. So given that I'm always looking for simple answers to complicated questions, if we think about 2021 versus 2020 what is the -- what was your MA mix in '20? I know you've said 2021, but how does that compare to 2020? Joel Ackerman : I think what we said is that at the end of '20 we were getting close to the 30th -- sorry the 30%. And we're now in the mid-30s. And remember the rest of the market is roughly around 40%, meaning the non-dialysis. John Ransom : Yes, but what was the average for '20. I know you said the end but where is it -- because I remember it was mid-20s? Joel Ackerman : Well if you assume that it moves roughly 2 percentage points in the year, you can do the math around that, but it's high 20s. John Ransom : I can do 30% minus 2% I think. All right. Joel Ackerman : You are good to simplifying things. John Ransom : Yes. I am simple. And then continuing on the simple theme, I know you're going to spend down some of this advantage. But I think we were thinking about the rate lift at something around $50 a treatment. Is that crazy from Medicare fee-for-service to Medicare advantage? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Whit -- I'm sorry John we've avoided commenting on this number for a while. You can imagine us sitting across the table from an MA plan. And just not wanting them to know exactly what the average rate is. So we're not going to comment on it. We wanted to be helpful in terms of thinking about how to model 2021 over 2020 which is why we called out the IKC investment as comparable in scale. So you see that they're largely a wash year-over-year. And again that wash is relative to the extra 3% of MA growth, not the full 5%. So we'll get the benefit of the 2% that we get year in year out. But the -- we don't want to comment on what the rate differential is between MA and normal Medicare fee-for-service. John Ransom : Sure. And then just I feel like an underexplored theme as your heroic labor force. So if you were to hazard a guess what percent of your labor force you think will agree to be vaccinated by the end of the year? Javier Rodriguez : It's a great question, John. We've been asking and on the flu we end up somewhere in the high 80s, low 90s. And so this is obviously a very unique experience they're going through and they've seen what's going on with COVID. Our data shows us right now slightly lower than the normal flu and then the question becomes once you have the vaccine if you can make it convenient and you can get the momentum will that number go back to the normal flu? And the short answer is, we don't know. But right now roughly 40% all of our labor force in the field has been vaccinated. John Ransom : Sure. And just back on labor for a minute. Do you think they are over the hump in terms of -- my neighbor has a Porsche, there you go? So I don\u2019t have a Porsche. Do you think the -- and I will just need a minute. But do you think they're over the hump if you will in terms of burnout and temps and exhaustion. I mean is that an unusual challenge for you? Or do you think that still continues into next year or this year actually? Javier Rodriguez : Well John, first of all, I really appreciate your empathy for this team because their commitment and resilience and just dedication has been just incredible and an inspiration to the rest of us. But no, they're actually in the thick of things this spike in the end of the year beginning of this year was steeper and more acute than anyone would anticipate. And so they've been working, working, working and trying to keep everybody safe. So the fatigue is real the emotional drain and the attachment that they have to our patients and seeing this mortality that we've talked about is an emotional and a heavy, heavy thing to deal with. And so I think that this is going to have consequences for the entire caregiving system for years to come. John Ransom : Yes, I do. Lastly, when you think about global risk and you guys had eight or so years with your former DaVita Medical Group, how do you think about controlling the two-thirds downstream that you don't control directly? Is it Medicare rates? Is it downstream risk contracts? Or is it just we control the patient we can make them healthier and they encounter the health system as they will, but we think having up front line set with the patient we can -- we can sort of control their behavior to make them healthier than sort of the average that we're shooting against? Javier Rodriguez : Let me grab it. And then Joel, you can supplement because I'm not sure, I understand exactly where you want to go. But at the end of the day, I think, the answer is\u2026 John Ransom : Not my wife ever does, either. I never know where I want to go. So that\u2019s fine. I never\u2026 Javier Rodriguez : My -- the two-third we're going to address some of it in our centers ourselves in areas where we think we can add a lot of value. And then we're going to deal with providers that we have a lot of trust with in other areas and so I think it's going to be a hybrid and we're learning a lot and we've learned a lot in our ESCOs is to where we have strength. So, for example, if you were to do a health assessment in the center when you have a patient for four hours, you can be quite thorough and you can have the systems to make sure that you do the appropriate therapy to intervene and so you get the twofer there. And other areas of healthcare as you know the challenge is getting a hold of the patient number one; and then number two, actually doing something about it intervening. And so we do have let's call it a strategic advantage in the access to the patient. Did that answer your question? John Ransom : Well but let's say, they go into a local hospital, I mean, are these Medicare rates that you're assuming? I mean I'm just trying to understand, sort of, the insurance company downstream contracting around access to the rest of the healthcare system? And how you either\u2026 Javier Rodriguez : Okay. I think, I understand your question. Most of the time in the contract... John Ransom : You were saying your margins in the other two-thirds. So I'm just trying to figure out how you get that margin there with two-third of spend? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I got you now. Most of the time the contract assumes that you get the payer's network and you're basically going after utilization and better care so you're trying to reduce utilization as opposed to price. John Ransom : I got you. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to understand a little better the magnitude of this movement you're talking about towards risk-taking with your MA population. So are there any numbers you can give around going forward x percent of the MA enrollment is in a capitated contract or a material gain sharing contract that isn't just a couple points based on quality of care and what that's looked like historically? Is it a material portion in 2021 of your MA patients that will be in something close to a capitated contracts? Joel Ackerman : It's still relatively small, but growing. We're -- look I'd say, fundamentally we see this business as being on the right side of healthcare. It's a big opportunity and we think we've got a right to win because of what Javier was talking about in terms of our ability to deliver quality and manage the care of the non-dialysis side today it's still relatively small. We're keeping a very careful eye on it. I think to me the important point that I emphasize is we view this as a new business rather than viewing it as some new way to finance the cost of dialysis. But in terms of magnitude today it's still small. Gary Taylor : And what about as direct contracting increases, obviously, you've got professional global this year you've got a limited theoretically rollout in 10 cities of geographic direct contracting. Next year. So you're going to have the same health plans now taking risk for your Medicare fee-for-service population, would you anticipate doing risk-based contracts if direct contracting takes off and grows? Or do you have any now? Javier Rodriguez : It's an interesting proposition. I mean, at the end of the day, I think, it's unlikely, but we would be open to explore it, because if someone upstream takes the risk and the example you laid out in direct contracting, we would be receiving Medicare fee-for-service in that example of direct contracting. So unless they literally said, hey, because of your strategic advantage of actually spending so much time with the patient, we think that you can partake with us. That would be very interesting. Of course, the other way to look at it is, can we be the direct contracting entity. And so, we will be looking at all these things and see how they play out. But that's where it stands now. Gary Taylor : My last question. I just want to understand this better. And maybe, it sounds like I'm just a little stale. I thought you guys had consistently said 25% of Medicare was with MA. So if you're going to average 35% in 2021, that's quite a pickup. I know you're saying, it's more or like 28% and some would always happen to be incremental, but it's obviously very well understood that MA payers paid above fee-for-service. I can understand why you don't want to disclose that differential, but we all had estimates of it. So if we were going to see MA penetration go to 35%, we had estimates of what that meant to you in terms of incremental rate and EBITDA. So, I guess, the question is, has the movement making all dialysis patients eligible for MA, has that created some price compression in that historic MA book? Because it doesn't sound like, with capitation being so small, that the related investments to that would be enough to offset our estimates of your incremental rate pickup. So, any color around that would be helpful. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Gary, let's just make sure we're all working with the same MA penetration rate. So the 25 number is from a couple of years ago and that grew 2%, maybe a little bit more each year over the last couple of years. So at the beginning of -- let me get my years right, at the beginning of 2019 that was probably in the ballpark, but you add a couple of percent, maybe a little more in 2019. And then again in that's how you get to the number Javier sighted, which is coming up right on 30% at the end of 2020 and adding another 5 points in 2021. Again those 5 points being, 2 points that we would have gotten anyway without the Cures Act, because this has been growing 2% a year and then another 3% for the Cures Act. So if you're trying to model what's the upside in 2021 as a result of the Cures Act coming online, I'd use that 3% number. Gary Taylor : Got it. And any comment about how that's impacted the rate environment? It sounds like it certainly engendered more risk-based discussions, but with the bulk of MA still paying fee-for-service, have you held up despite the fact that there's more volume moving in that direction? Javier Rodriguez : I think, in general, the plans have paid a lot of attention to it, but they always have. And so it's a discussion and the conversation has really gotten more into a shift of can we do value base. But the short answer is that we didn't have that many at-bats, because most of the contracts we're longer term, so yet to be seen. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Larew : Thanks. Just on new center development, you have some nice context around NAG. In terms of new center development, I guess, maybe help us think about what 2021 and 2022 might look like. You had mentioned the number fading into mid-2021 and then ramping back up. But maybe just curious, given the higher mortality you're seeing. And, obviously, on the outside looking in, we don't have a sense for geographic context on that, but has that affected the way you're thinking about new center builds and any change to sort of a 50-50 target home versus non-home? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So, it will impact our thinking about new center development. But there's a real -- there's a long lead time from when you conceive of a center until you build it and you get it certified. So I don't think you'd see much impact in the new center numbers in 2021 or even 2022. That said, look, the numbers have come down, we certified a little more than 80 new centers in 2020. I think we actually built something in the mid-40s. And then, if you look forward to next year, again, you'll see the number certified come way down. And the actual number we're going to build next year will probably be more likely in the 20s. So that number was coming down fast before COVID. Matt Larew : Yes. That's helpful. And then, just maybe one more on sort of the value-based care side. Just curious, if any of your conversations have at all started to include thought presses about moving upstream with payers and dementia and CKD population and leveraging some of your pretty robust resources like Kidney Smart? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, is a short answer and everybody is new at this meaning the plans are, and we're working through what that means and what the implications are of going upstream. And then of course, there's some regulatory restrictions to deal with. But at the end of the day, we're all trying to manage the patient as soon as possible to make sure that that transition is as smooth as possible. Matt Larew : Okay. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Clive : Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Can you give us an update on the time line for the lawsuit over the network adequacy rule? And what do you think the chances are the new rule gets overturned? And then assuming it doesn't overturned, what is your best guess on the impact on the change in dynamics over the next five years? Do you think that MA rates on dialysis treatment could go down? Or the number of clinics decrease if clinics are not -- are too far away. Obviously, that doesn't seem to be at all a problem right now but just thinking out a few years? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thanks, Lisa. And let me step up a couple of feet in case people haven't been tracking it. There is a network adequacy demand on MA plan and for dialysis patients there was a shift in an objective measure that had time and distance. And then basically, they dropped the objective criteria and made it more subjective and just saying you have to have an adequate network. The update on that is that, there was basically a technical reason and then the case is no longer active right now. As we look into whether we and community and patients will pursue the next one, we are actually waiting to make sure that we have harm. And so we're waiting to see, if a plan actually doesn't abide by the spirit of making sure that there's adequacy. Right now, we have not experienced any of that, and we hope that we don't. But that's the status of the update. Lisa Clive : Okay. So the original challenge is no longer moving forward? Javier Rodriguez : Correct. Lisa Clive : Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. Next you will hear from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Justin Lake : Thanks for the follow-up. Joel, I wanted to go back to the $60 million that you talked about and it being entirely coming from mortality effectively with everything else watching out. Can you give us some color in terms of how that $60 million progressed through the year? Is it more fourth quarter base? Or was there -- I assume there was some drag in 2Q and 3Q for mortality? Joel Ackerman : Yes. There was a bit in two. It grew in three and I think about half of it was in Q4. And it's a number that accumulates right? Because the impact of loss treatments on Q4 is associated with our patients, who passed away in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 and that's why you see it accumulating that way and you'll see that pattern continuing in the front half of the year in 2021. Justin Lake : Yes, that's exactly, why I'm asking. So it's about $30 million, $10 million, $20 million $30 million it sounds like give or take is the way to think about it? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Justin Lake : And so, yes, I'm actually surprised given the COVID spike in the fourth quarter that it was only up similar to 1Q or 2Q, 3Q. Is there a net like by the end of the year? Joel Ackerman : The reason for that is the spike happened in November and December. And remember, generally, mortality lags the spike in the infection curve by three or four weeks. Justin Lake : Right. So that's a good point. So maybe you can -- can you give us a number maybe that we can think about as if -- just at year-end given the number of patients that had passed away what would that number look like if you kind of not annualized or maybe we can talk about annualized that 12/31 number? Like, if no one else passes what's the number at kind of year-end that we're going to see quarterly for the rest of the year? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I don't have that math in front of me. But again, if you think about how the $200 million in this one scenario we played out. And I just want to emphasize again, this is one scenario. We think it's a reasonable middle scenario, but it could play out in many different ways. But if you think about what -- how to model that $200 million over the course of the year, I think you can think about it as relatively flat. Most of the increase in our patients passing away will happen in Q1. Q1 is also more likely to be burdened with some other expenses than the later quarters. So it's complicated math. Maybe Q2 is a little higher than Q1, as a result of the mortality growing. But, flat across the year is not an unreasonable starting point. Justin Lake : Got it. Got it. So it's going to pick up significantly in the first quarter, then it's going to go from like $30 million a quarter to like $60 million to $70 million, a quarter, call it, $60 million. And maybe increase a little from there and then go forward. And that's how you're going to be up -- well, actually I'm wrong, it's not going to increase that much. It will be $50 million like you said or something in a quarter. Okay. And is there -- I tried to look at the patient count you did an acquisition it looks like in the UK, that's going to change that number. Is there any way, I can get you guys to share that. And maybe before we hop off the call Javier, I know you had been focused on kind of rightsizing the footprint internationally. So I'm a little surprised, to see you to be doing more acquisitions internationally. Maybe you can share with us, strategically why that was important? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. A couple of things, I think we stayed consistent to the discipline that we have outlined on capital markets, which is basically we would be very, very diligent on, where we could add clinical value, where we had the right to scale, where we had a content management team. And we thought, from a compliance perspective, it was a place where we could operate safely and that we had capital efficiency. The UK has been going from a government-led program to a private. And it is a very interesting market, where it is predictable. And we understand it. And so we won a tender. And we think that the, returns will be good. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Justin, I'd just add. It's -- I think it's a great acquisition for the international team and exciting for them to get back -- to get into a new country, after we had been pruning the platform. And then, maintaining the discipline of capital efficient growth. So from that standpoint, it's great. From a materiality standpoint, in terms of impact on OI, it's pretty small. Justin Lake : And do you have the patients acquired for mutual, give or take? Joel Ackerman : I don't have the number, off the top of my head. We'll see if we can get it for you. If not we'll get it to you, after the call. Justin Lake : Thanks a lot. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Thank you. And we are showing no further questions at this time. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well. Thank you. Let me close off with some comments here. Number one, our team's commitment and dedication to the safety and health of our patients is absolutely unwavering. It is really sad and unfortunate that our patients age in comorbid conditions, make them significantly more vulnerable to COVID. We are going to work diligently, to get as many vaccinated as soon as possible. Number two, we shared with you today some of the dynamics that the pandemic has had on our company, on our patients and on our teams. I hope it was helpful. Of course, the ranges will follow the trajectory of this very unpredictable pandemic. And then lastly, absent the pandemic impact which is very hard to say that sentence, because everything here starts with the pandemic, our business plan has shown resiliency and in line with our multiyear outlook that we discussed at capital markets. So I end with hopefully some optimism, that I like you hope that this vaccine can move us past this stage. Thank you for our interest in DaVita. And we'll talk soon. Stay safe. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I\u2019m Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and any subsequent filings we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update those statements, except as may be required by law. Additionally, we\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon. Over the last several months, we have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and it\u2019s with continued optimism that I provide several updates today starting with vaccination, followed by a summary of the first quarter performance, then an update on our improved outlook for the year, and finally an overview of our ongoing commitment to ESG. Q1 brought a lot of smiles as a kidney care community administered hundreds of thousands of vaccines to its patients. Providers worked closely with the Biden administration, the CDC, and state governments so the dialysis patients could be vaccinated in a trusted and convenient side of care. We knew that this would help our patients overcome transportation and other access challenges getting to third-party sites. And we had confidence that the hesitancy rate would decline when they received education from a trusted caretaker. Thanks to all the hard work by our teams and the government partners, I\u2019m proud to say that as of yesterday, 72% of our patients nationwide have received at least one vaccine dose. We also saw an opportunity to positively impact health equity by administering COVID vaccine in our clinics. Similar to the early results in the broader U.S. population in the first few weeks of the vaccine rollout, we saw the vaccination rates for black and Hispanics were approximately 40% below that of white and Asian Americans. This did not sit well with us. We got to work and mobilize our care teams including social workers, dietitians, and medical directors to have one-on-one conversations with patients to address common causes of hesitancy. Our Hispanic patients have now been vaccinated at nearly the same rate as white patient and the gap for our black patients has been reduced to 10%. We are not done. Our pursuit for health equity continues. On to our first quarter financial results, we delivered solid performance in Q1 as our operating margins returned to 15.7% in the quarter, while we continue to lead through the continued challenges presented by the pandemic. And we covered on our last call, treatment volumes declined in Q1. Our treatments per day hit a low point in mid-February, including the impact of approximately 25,000 mid treatments from the winter storm. Since then, our daily treatment trends have steadily improved. If these trends continue, absent any further infection surges, we believe that our sequential patient census growth through the end of the year could return to pre-COVID level, which is what we incorporated in our guidance ranges we provided last quarter. We\u2019ve provided a bit more detail on volume that supports our outlook. First, with our update in Q1, COVID case counts and new infections within our dialysis population have continued to decline. As of last Friday, the number of active cases amongst our patient across the country decreased approximately 85% from peak prevalence on January 6, 2021. In the last seven day incidence rate for new cases decreased approximately 91% from the week ending January 9, 2021. Second, we\u2019re grateful that we\u2019re seeing a dramatic decline in the mortality rates associated with COVID. We previously shared that the unfortunate incremental mortality associated with COVID was approximately 7,000 in 2020. In 2021, both our patient mortality count and mortality count in the general population peaked in January. In the first quarter incremental mortality associated with COVID was approximately 3,300 lives, with more than half of that number occurring in January, decreasing to approximately 600 in March. It is too early to provide an estimate for April, but we expect the results will improve versus March. Chip into full year outlook. Our view of core operation performance for the year remains largely unchanged from our original guidance. However, now that the likelihood of some downside scenarios has decreased due to the trends I had previously mentioned, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $8.20 to $9 per share, and our adjusted operating income guidance range to $1.75 billion to $1.875 billion. At the midpoint of our revised adjusted operating income guidance this would represent approximately a 4% growth year-over-year. These revised ranges assume no further major disruption from the virus range. My final topic is our ongoing commitment to environmental, social, and governance matters, or ESG. ESG has become a more significant topic of conversation and investment community over the last couple of years. These are not new areas of focus for us at DaVita. Our beliefs are incorporated into our stated vision of social responsibility that has three components, caring for our patient, caring for each other, and caring for the world around us, including both our communities, and our environment. DaVita continue to execute against this vision, providing top quality clinical care for our patient is at the core of what we do, and because have already spoken at length about our patients care and our efforts to vaccinate our patients, I\u2019d like to highlight a few of our achievements in caring for our teammates, and caring for the world around us. I believe that fostering an environment rich in diversity and where we all feel that we belong is imperative to our culture, and how we connect with each other, and how we connect with our patients every day. In our commitment to cultivating diversity is evident throughout the organization. It starts with the Board of Directors currently made up of nine leaders from 67% are diverse, including four women and three people of color. The diversity of our team extends to leaders who run the core operations in our clinics, of whom 52% are female, and 27% of people of color. These results have been achieved through thoughtful and deliberate practices to create a diverse pipeline of talent. In 2021, we published our first report on diversity and belonging, disclosing many of our company\u2019s diverse metrics in our ongoing efforts to cultivate a diverse organization in which everyone feels that he or she belong. We also recently publish our 14th Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report and our first ESG report. These reports disclosed the progress we made in 2020 and lay out our ambitious ESG goals for 2025 including goals to reduce carbon emissions by 50%. To have vendors representing 70% of emission set climate change goals and to achieve engagement scores of 84% or higher among our teammates population. We are pleased with our progress to date on diversity and ESG. And as you can see by our goal, we have a lot more we hope to accomplish. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. Q1 was a strong start to the year with solid financial performance. For the quarter, we recorded revenue of approximately $2.8 billion operating income of $443 million and earnings per share of $2.09. As Javier referenced, treatment volume was a large headwind and our non-acquired growth was negative 2.2% compared to negative 0.3% in Q4. While COVID presented the main challenge to NAG in Q1. Winter storms, particularly Uri were responsible for about 30 basis points of the NAG decline, treatments per day bottomed out during the first quarter. So we expect to start seeing quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2. We continue to expect that NAG will be negative for the year, although we expect to see an acceleration of NAG in 2022 and 2023 as mortality rates may be lower than the pre-COVID levels for a few years. U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $3 this quarter, as a result of the Medicare rate increase, higher enrollment in MA plan, a slight improvement in commercial mix and higher volume from our hospital services business. Partially offset by the seasonal impact of coinsurance and deductible. U.S. dialysis patient care costs declined sequentially by approximately $6 per treatment, although we continue to experience elevated costs due to the pandemic, such as higher PPE, and certain clinical level expenses from continued infection control protocol. Our Q1 patient care costs included in nearly $2 per treatment benefit from our power purchase agreement, benefits that we do not expect to persist through the rest of the year. For the quarter, the net headwind related to COVID was approximately $35 million, consisting primarily of higher PPE costs, and the compounding effect of patient mortality associated with COVID partially offset by the benefit from the sequestration suspension, with a number of other items that largely offset each other. For fiscal year 2021, we now estimate the net negative impact from COVID to be approximately $50 million lower than our guidance last quarter. This is the result of lower COVID impact in Q1. The recently passed extension of the Medicare sequestration relief through the end of the year, and lower other offsets including T&E in the back half of the year. At the middle of our guidance range, this would equate to a $150 million negative impact from COVID in 2021. Our DSO increased by approximately seven days in Q1 versus Q4, primarily due to temporary billing holds related to the winter storms and the changes in calcimimetics reimbursement. In certain circumstances, we hold claim to make sure we have complete an accurate charge information for payments. This quarter, we had more of these holds, and the last, single largest driver was related to winter storm Uri, which impacted more than 600 of our centers until right in the middle of the quarter. This has the effect of pushing a significant amount of cash flow from this quarter to the next and cause the corresponding DSO increase in the interim. While claim hold shift cash flow between quarters, they have no negative impact and what we ultimately expect to collect. We\u2019ve already seen a significant increase in cash collections in April and expect a corresponding positive impact on both cash flow and DSOs over the next two quarters. A couple of final points. In the first quarter, we repurchase 2.9 million shares of our common stock and to-date in April, we repurchase approximately one million additional shares. Debt expense was $67 million for the quarter. We expect quarterly debt expense to increase to approximately $75 million beginning next quarter as a result of the $1 billion of notes issued in late February. Before we open up the line for Q&A, let me share some reflections. Over the past year, our teams and our business experienced unusual volatility and challenges due to the pandemic. We have weathered this very difficult period because of our dedication of our people, our scale, our innovation, in holistic platform and approach to patient care. As I look forward, our organization is stronger. Our relationships with patients have deepened, that have even more resolved that our comprehensive kidney care platform is well positioned to deliver a best-in-class value proposition for our patients, physicians and hospitals and payer partners. Now, let\u2019s open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the operating income guidance that you raised it by 3.5% or about $63 million at the midpoint. And you talked about some of the gives and takes sequestration and/or impact in COVID and lower sort of costs in the back half of year. Can you sort of help us quantify which were the drivers of those? Joel Ackerman : Sure. Hello, Pito, it\u2019s Joel here. So I would think about three things really. We beat this quarter, so obviously that helps with the full year. Sequestration was the biggest driver here and that\u2019s about $50 million. And then looking towards the back half of the year, we\u2019ve taken down some of the COVID offsets that we were expecting from G&A and T&E. As things get a little bit better, we were not expecting as much offset in Q3 and Q4. So you put that all together and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll wind up. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then the treatment growth declined 1.3% sequentially and 2.2% year-over-year. I understand there are a lot of missed treatments from host relations from the storms. They\u2019re offset by your acute business and obviously the mortality issue. With that being said, is there any chance you can give us monthly treatments during the quarter and through April? Or just help us understand the pace of recovery and how you plan to get back to patient census to pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Pito, I appreciate the question. We\u2019re not going to give monthly, but let me try and help out a little bit. February was the bottom. And that was driven largely by the mortality issue, but also Uri the storm resulting in about 25,000 missed treatments. We saw recovery in March both as the mortality issue got better as well as the recovery after the storm, and then April trended a little better from there as well. I think it\u2019s a little early to quantify it and try and use a number to draw a trend line. These numbers can bounce around a bit. So that\u2019s where we are. Pito Chickering : And the last question, the revenue per treatment was pretty strong, with all the items you laid out. So two quick questions. The first is how much did co-pay pressure did you see in the first quarter? So what would be a good assumption for revenue per treatment in 2Q? And as you look forward for the next couple of years, is there a reason why a 2% revenue per treatment growth wouldn\u2019t be the right assumption to make? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So a couple of things I\u2019d highlight about Q1 RPT. In terms of quantifying the co-insurance and deductible, that\u2019s somewhere in the $5 to $6 of treatment range. So you\u2019d add that to what you\u2019d expect to see in Q2. We also had a pickup in Q1 over Q4 as a result of calcimimetics. I\u2019ll remind you, calcimimetics OI in 2021 will be similar to 2020, but the seasonal pattern will be very different. So we picked up $2 \u2013 about $2 of RPT in Q1 over Q4 from that. In terms of looking forward about what RPT will look like, we\u2019ve moved away from guiding on RPT as you\u2019ll remember. In terms of what\u2019s a reasonable number, is 2% reasonable? I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s unreasonable, but it might be a little on the high end of the range that I probably think about, but we\u2019ll have more to say on 2022 RPT obviously later in the year. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question\u2026 Joel Ackerman : I\u2019m sorry, operator. Pito, just to jump in on that, that my comment, obviously, you\u2019d have to adjust for sequestration, which would go away presumably between 2022 and 2021 and that would be a big number. Pito Chickering : Yes, of course. It\u2019s more so just excluding sequestration to gives and takes within the overall market demand, the shift to MA, was a 2% reasonable. Joel Ackerman : Exactly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Maybe just staying on the RPT for a second. Is it fair to say that when you listed the things that throw RPT in the quarter, that they were listed in the order of importance that the rate update was the biggest one? Joel Ackerman : I\u2019d say there are four things and they\u2019re roughly all about the same order of magnitude, and that\u2019s the Medicare rate update, calcimimetics, the mix changes \u2013 commercial mix change and then MA. They\u2019re roughly in the same order of magnitude. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, when we think about the improvement in volumes that you expect to see as the year goes on, how should we think about that from a mix perspective? Is that volume improvement, disproportionately commercial improvement? And does that have any implications for margins or profits? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So I\u2019d say the likelihood is that the mix will be more Medicare than commercial. Remember, the mortality we\u2019ve seen as a result of COVID was disproportionate in the older population as you would expect, and our older population is disproportionately Medicare. So as you see the unwind happen from COVID over the next X number of years, we think that would lead to a lower kind of our commercial mix trending down a bit. In terms of the implications for margin, there\u2019s an offset to that, recognizing that these new patients will be filling unused capacity and that would have a tendency to drive margins up. How those two \u2013 those countervailing forces play forth, remains to be seen and it\u2019s a tough number to predict its dependent on a lot of the some of the underlying assumptions. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If it wasn\u2019t 100%, clear to me, what you were saying as far as your bridge to the guidance. You\u2019ve said he took down some of the COVID offsets, does that \u2013 are you basically saying that you were prepared for things to get worse, and you had cost cuts all lined up and now that things are coming in better you don\u2019t feel the need to push that as much as that? Joel Ackerman : No, our T&E is down. And it\u2019s been down since the beginning of COVID, as teammates travel less, and we had modeled that continuing through the end of the year. And now we think, for example, that T&E in Q3 and Q4 could return closer to pre-COVID levels. So the offset, the benefit we got from lower T&E is probably going to be less than we anticipated. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess last question, can you give an update on your contracting outlook for Medicare Advantage. Are there any large books of business that are up for renewal next year? And how are things going on as far as rates and conversations around going to more value based models? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, Kevin, this is Javier. How are you? Thanks for the question. Let me just start off by saying that there is no spike or change in volume of renewals or anything like that it\u2019s in its normal cycle. The conversations continue to be highly, highly aligned and trying to make sure that we add more value to the patients and help in the care continuum. So, and the fact that we\u2019re doing more complicated contracts, instead of a fee-for-service, means that it takes longer. So as it relates to that there\u2019s nothing sort of there to talk about, because the outlook is kind of unchanged, and it\u2019s incorporated in our guidance. Kevin Fischbeck : All right, thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good afternoon. Few questions to you. First, in terms of the guidance change, it looks like you talked about things getting a little bit better on the COVID front, I think you said $50 million when you knit it all together, and that\u2019s basically we took up or what you took the guy by? So does that imply that the first quarter looked better than my model and I think better than consensus? So does that mean that the quarter was actually kind of in line with your views? Or was the first quarter kind of materially better from an OI perspective? Joel Ackerman : Yes, I\u2019d say Justin, the, the Q1 was within the range of what we were expecting, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little bit on the positive side, but it\u2019s early in the year to start tinkering with our full year guidance and our full year forecast. So despite what I would characterize as a strong quarter, we chose to keep things in line. Justin Lake : Okay. And then the $150 million, I think you said Joel, was the net COVID headwinds? Joel Ackerman : Correct, for the year. Justin Lake : For the full year. Okay. So, but it looks like that has a bunch of different components, right? If I think about it, there\u2019s COVID costs right, as a part of it, there\u2019s the negative impact on treatments, then there\u2019s the benefit of sequestration, which it sounds like you put in there. And then there\u2019s some cost offsets. So, I\u2019m just trying to think about, is there any way to help us understand those four buckets? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So you\u2019ve got it right. And I think it ultimately, it\u2019s a pretty simple calculation. You take the excess costs associated with PPE and that roughly offsets with sequestration. And then everything else is a wash and what you resulted in is basically, the negative impact of mortality, which is in that $150 million range. So there are a lot of moving pieces, but net-net, they mostly cancel out and leave you with the impact of mortality. Justin Lake : Okay. And then as you think about the impact on mortality, obviously to your point, we probably saw a bottom in the first quarter, and things are expected to get better through the year. So, I\u2019m just trying to think about the pace of that, $150 million, right? Because it\u2019s the exit rates going to be important coming out of fourth quarter, to think about the impact on next year. So, can you help us think about that, in terms of where you think that impact is in this quarter? And where you think that impact will be kind of in the fourth quarter? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So this stuff gets pretty technical, pretty quickly. But let me try and help you out. I think the way I would think about it to simplify it as you start with what our typical NAG is. And if you want to grab a number, go back pre-COVID and pick something in the low 2%s, 2.2%, something like that. And you really see that impacted by any continued excess mortality. But again, we think that\u2019s declining rapidly, you\u2019ll probably see some in Q2, but going down quickly, again, assuming COVID plays out the way we expect on its way out. But obviously things could be different. So start with NAG, add excess mortality then adjust for what could be a challenge to the pipeline, if you want to assume there\u2019s any CKDs for impact. We don\u2019t have data on that. But if we look at what we see in terms of new agonists, we don\u2019t see any impact there that we don\u2019t see any impact from that right now, but you\u2019d have to incorporate that. And then we see a tailwind coming up as patients who otherwise would have died in the next quarter or two passed away as a result of COVID. And that\u2019s a hard one to measure. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d model it. If you want to get kind of simplistic and I realize I\u2019m throwing a lot of numbers and a complicated story at you. I think\u2026 Justin Lake : I\u2019m begging you to get the perfect Joel. Joel Ackerman : You add back the tailwind associated with lower mortality post-COVID. And that\u2019s how you start modeling what NAG looks like going forward. Justin Lake : All right, I\u2019ll not smart enough to figure that out. But we\u2019ll talk about it offline. Just last question. The \u2013 can you give us the commercial mix change from kind of, what you were looking at in the fourth quarter kind into the first quarter here? Joel Ackerman : It went up a small amount, not much, but it was up a little bit. Justin Lake : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, thanks for taking my follow-up questions. A couple quick ones here. It\u2019s been a pretty fun two years from a share repurchase perspective, I\u2019m just curious, what we think about is the right leverage ratio for the business at this point, it kind of where should we deploy the rest of that into share repo is it around 3.5, at this point so want to just get a feeling for how we should think about leverage ratios versus share repo? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So look, I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on this. And nothing has really changed; we want to be in that three to 3.5 times where we\u2019re at 3.39. Right now, we did a $1 billion bond deal during the quarter. Cash flow for the rest of the year is likely to be relatively strong. You saw cash flow in Q1 was weak. And we think we\u2019ll make that up over the course of the year, but no reason to think our philosophy and approach to leverage ratio and buybacks is going to change over the near future. Pito Chickering : Second one is quicker one, what was the percentage of your Medicare Advantage penetration, this year versus last year? Joel Ackerman : We disclosed last time as our expectation is in line, what we said was mid-to-high 30% and markets roughly around 43%. So, we\u2019re slightly below the rest of the market still in the mid-to-high 30s. Pito Chickering : Okay. So what percent of your patients were treated in the home this quarter, if you see that accelerating, sort of in this post-COVID environment? Joel Ackerman : The percentage hasn\u2019t changed much because with NAG decreasing, but that segment of our business did increase in particular PD, PD grew around 4%. Home hemodialysis, the HH part of it decreased, but net-net that\u2019s the segment of the businesses that continues to grow. We think that there is appetite from the physician community and the patients to have more flexibility and freedom. And we are innovating and creating a lot of technology so that the patients feel more comfortable and more confident, more convenient, being connected to our care site. So, we do expect that the modalities will continue to grow. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. Thanks so much guys. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We are showing no further questions at this time. Javier Rodriguez : Okay, well, hopefully that short means that it was pretty clear. Let me just say some closing comments. Q1, 2021, in my mind, and in my heart and in many of our caregivers will always be remembered and come with a lot of fulfillment for vaccinating literally 10s of 1000s of patients, in many instances not being dramatic or overstating it literally life sustaining. Second, the quarter financials are pretty straightforward and pending a shift in the virus. We begin a path toward our historical normalization. And then lastly, our teams continued unwavering commitment towards caring and innovating to improve the lives of our patients. We thank you for your interest in DaVita. And we look forward to talking to you soon. Stay safe. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon. We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2 performance, our 2021 financial outlook and recent developments on our efforts to transform Kidney Care. First, let me start the conversation with a clinical highlight that kidney transplant is the best treatment option for eligible patients with kidney failure. DaVita has worked hard over the years to help our patients gain access to transplant through education and direct support for patients to get on and stay on the transplantation waitlist. The cumulative impact is meaningful. Last December, we announced the milestone of 100,000 DaVita patients who have received the transplant since the year 2000. To further advance, the cause of transplantation, DaVita and the National Kidney Foundation are collaborating on a yearlong pilot aimed at improving health equity in kidney transplantation with a focus on living donors. Increasing living donor transplant expands access to transplantation by increasing the availability of organ, which has been the limiting factor in the number of transplants performed annually. This pilot provides high touch and customized information to patients and families seeking a kidney transplantation from a living donor. We look forward to learning more from this pilot, improving the health equity of kidney transplant and continuing to be the leader in supporting our patients to receive kidney transplant. Shifting to the latest update on COVID. We have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic over the past several months. New COVID infections among our patients continue to drop significantly through the last week of June, down more than 95% from the peak in early January. However, similar to the rest of the country, we have started to see an uptick over the last few weeks. As of last week on a rolling seven-day average basis, new infections are still down more than 90% from the peak. Thus far, our mortality continues to remain low on an absolute basis as we believe that our vaccinated patients are more protected from severe cases of COVID. We continue to educate our patients about the benefits of vaccine to reduce vaccine hesitancy. And we remain confident in our policies and procedures designed to keep our patients and our teammates safe while they\u2019re in our care. Now, let me turn to our financial performance in the second quarter. We delivered strong results in both operating income and earnings per share. Our margins expanded as we continue to manage costs while delivering quality care. As a result, we delivered 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income, and 35% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share. Our free cashflow was particularly strong in this quarter and we continue to return cash to our shareholders through our stock buyback. With the first half of the year behind us, we are now increasing the midpoint of guidance for the full year. Let me transition to update our progress in our Integrated Kidney Care efforts, otherwise known as IKC. Value-based care for our patients with kidney disease is gaining momentum and appears to have reached an inflection point. We have always believed that coordinating dialysis care with the broader healthcare needs of CKD and ESKD patients could simultaneously improve outcomes and reduce total healthcare costs. For years, we\u2019ve been participating in a variety of small programs and pilots to build our integrated care capability and better understand the economics. We believe we are at that point now where we are ready to shift to the next stage of the evolution of integrated care. You might be wondering why now. The trend towards value-based care is not new either in Kidney Care or other segments of healthcare. So what\u2019s changed to make the developments of scale business viable today? There\u2019s a couple of reasons. First, with the growth of Medicare advantage, payers are looking for innovative ways to manage the increasing number of ESKD patients choosing MA plans. These patients tend to be more complex than most MA patients and should benefit from tailored care management. Second, CMS recently initiated the payment model in Kidney Care. We\u2019re preparing to partner with nephrologists and up to 12 markets beginning in January of next year to participate in CKCC voluntary program. Our participation in CKCC model will also provide us with operational scale and more geographies to enter into other value-based arrangements. Lastly, we\u2019ve increased our confidence in our capabilities to deliver clinical and economic value at scale and have leaned in on our willingness to take risks. We believe we\u2019re well positioned to win in integrated care because of our strong partnership with nephrologists, our regular and consistent interactions with patients, a broad kidney care platform that spans various modalities of care setting and a clinical dataset and analytics that we use to create, develop clinical interventions to support our patients holistically. We have a demonstrated track record of improving patient outcomes, coordinating care and lowering costs for patients in risk arrangements. For example, in our ESCOs, we were able to generate non-dialysis cost savings in the high-single digit, which translated into more than double the average savings rates compared to the rest of the industry over the life of the program. With our Special Needs Plan, we have been able to lower mortality by 23% relative to other patients within the same center and county. To give you a better sense of the scale of the business, as of today, approximately 10% of our U.S. dialysis patients are in value-based care arrangements, in which DaVita is responsible for managing the total cost of care. It represents almost $2 billion of annual medical costs under management. In addition, we have various other forms of value-based care arrangements with payers, in which we have economic incentives for improving quality and lowering costs. In 2022, we expect our integrated kidney care business to double in size, both the number of patients and risk arrangements, and the dollars under management. We also expect to see a dramatic increase in the number of CKD lives we have under risk in 2022. To prepare for this growth, we\u2019re currently scaling up our clinical teams and furthering building out our support function, because of the investment, as well as the delays in cost savings impact of our model of care and revenue recognition, we expect to incur a net operating loss of $120 million in 2021 in our U.S. ancillary segment. This outcome is consistent with the OI headwind from IKC growth we called out at the beginning of the year and is of course included in our full year guidance. The doubling of the business next year could result in an incremental operating loss in our ancillary segment of $50 million in 2022. We expect significant improvement in our financial performance beginning in 2023 as we begin to recognize savings from the new contract that we entered in 2021 and 2022. Over the five plus year horizon, we believe that our IKC business could become a sustainable driver of significant operating income growth. Currently we serve approximately 200,000 dialysis patients across the country. We utilize over $12 billion in healthcare services, outside of the dialysis facility, including the cost of hospitalization, outpatient procedures and physician services. In addition, we see an opportunity to manage the care of upstream CKD patients, who currently do not dialyze in our centers. Assuming, that we are managing the total cost of care for more than half of our dialysis patients as well as other CKD patients at low-to-single digit margin, we believe that this could be meaningful financial opportunity. In summary, all of healthcare has been talking about value-based for years. We are excited for DaVita to lead the way. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joel. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter, despite the continuing operational challenges presented by COVID primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on cost. For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings per share were $2.64. Our Q2 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $35 million, similar to what we saw in Q1, primarily the impact of excess mortality on volume and elevated PPE costs, partially offset by sequestration relief, and reduced travel and meeting expenses. Turning to volume, in Q2 treatments per day increased by 0.4% compared to Q1, excess mortality declined significantly in Q2 from approximately 3,000 in Q1 to fewer than 500 in Q2. At this point, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us, but we\u2019re closely monitoring the potential impact of the Delta variant, especially within pockets of the country that have lower vaccination rates. Longer-term, we continue to believe that we will return to pre-pandemic treatment growth levels with an additional tailwind from lower-than-normal mortality rates. Our U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $6 this quarter, primarily due to normal seasonal improvements from patients meeting their co-insurance and deductible obligations. We also saw favorable changes in government rate and mix, including the continued growth in the percentage of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Patient care costs and G&A expense per treatment in total were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our patient care costs decreased sequentially primarily due to reductions in labor costs. Our G&A increased slightly primarily due to charitable contributions and increases in personnel costs. As expected, our U.S. dialysis and lab DSO decreased by approximately six days in Q2 versus Q1, primarily due to collections on the temporary billing holds related to the winter storms in the first quarter. The majority of the impact of the storms on DSO and cash flow were reversed in Q2, but we may see an ongoing, smaller benefit to the balance of the year. During the second quarter, we generated a gain of approximately $9 million on one of our DaVita Venture Group investments, which hit the other income line on our P&L. We have a small investment in Miromatrix Medical that recently went public. The value of this investment at quarter-end was $23 million. Going forward, we will market-to-market every quarter. Now turning to some updates on the rest of this year and some initial thoughts on 2022, as Javier mentioned, we are raising our guidance ranges for 2021 as follows. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.40, adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion to $1.875 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Also, we now expect our 2021 effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita to be between 24% and 26% lower than the 26% to 28% range that we had communicated at the beginning of the year. These new guidance ranges exclude the potential impact of a significant fourth COVID surge later this year. I\u2019ll call out two notable potential headwinds during the second half of the year. First is COVID. We continue to expect the impact of excess mortality will be higher in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year, due to the compounding impact of mortality through 2021. We\u2019re also expecting an uptick on costs related to testing, vaccinations and teammate support as a result of the delta variant. As a result, we are increasing the middle of the range of COVID impact for the full year to $170 million from $150 million. That implies a $30 million headwind from COVID in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. As a reminder, this is the middle of what is a wide range of possible impacts depending on the impact of the delta or other variants and any additional COVID mandate. Second, we expect to experience losses in our U.S. ancillary segment of approximately $70 million in the second half of the year compared to $50 million in the first half of the year. This incremental loss is due primarily to new value-based care arrangements and start-up costs associated with the CKCC program that launches in 2022. Looking forward to 2022 we do not expect anything unusual among the primary drivers of the business, including RPT, cost per treatment or capital expenditures. However we expect pressure on OI growth from the increased spend on growing our IKC business, the possibility of union activity in 2022 that we did not face in 2021 and the first year of depreciation expense associated with our new clinical IT platform that we have been developing for the past several years. We will provide more specific 2022 guidance on our future earnings call. Operator, let\u2019s open the lines for questions. Q - Pito Chickering : Hey guys, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Lead off here on the IKC that you\u2019re talking about that you disclosed in the script $2 billion of gross revenues and seeing that doubling in 2022, can you remind us how that flows through the P&L in both the dialysis segments and in other ancillary services? When will you begin to disclose these revenues and costs on the P&L so you can model it? And then in five years, where do you think this can go? Is that a $12 billion number that you referenced in the script? And from a margin perspective after year one, you put a high single-digit margin on the $2 billion for next year and then additional drag in the $2 billion in new capitated arrangement? Thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Pito. I hope I got all of that, but please jump in if I didn\u2019t catch it. So starting off, in terms of where it is on the P&L, we\u2019ve got a segment, our strategic initiatives, which breaks down between U.S. and international. The U.S. component of strategic initiatives is an excellent proxy for our IKC P&L. We\u2019ve simplified what exists in that segment over the last few years as we\u2019ve exited some of the strategic initiatives and other than a couple of small things, it\u2019s everything related to IKC through that line. So I think as you think about both revenue and operating income using the U.S. component of SIs as a proxy for our IKC business is a really good way to look at it. So that\u2019s number one. In terms of where this can go over time, look, there are a lot of questions around how many members we can enroll here, what our savings rate can be, how much of that will ultimately capture. I think a reasonably simple way to model it would be to start with something like a third of our ESKD population in this user a spend per patient, especially if you\u2019re looking out a few years of $100,000 per patient, and that will give you a medical cost under management. And then the question is, what percent of medical cost under management that we think can turn into OI. And I would say a reasonable number would be something in the low single digits, something equivalent to what a typical MA plan would drive as margin. So 1%, 2%, 3%, maybe 4% in that range as a percentage of medical cost under management, I think is the right way to think about what the potential for this is in the out years. Pito Chickering : Okay. This is\u2026 Joel Ackerman : I\u2019m sorry. Pito, you had \u2013 I think you had a third question which I didn\u2019t catch. Pito Chickering : Yes. So there\u2019s a few progressions period in there. I guess, will you guys begin disclosing what those gross revenues are as all the patients under management? Just help us model this going forward as well. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re not going to disclose a number that we would call gross revenue. I think the number that we will disclose would be what the revenue would be if we used gross revenue accounting, which would be the medical cost under management. And we\u2019ve seen this before, they were under DMG, they were components of the business that were gross accounting and some were net and we would disclose a medical cost under management or something like that and that\u2019s the $2 billion number that Javier talked about in the script. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then a sort of quick follow-up here on just the treatment growth. Can you guys disclose a number of patients you had at the end of 1Q and 2Q? And I\u2019m trying to understand what treatment growth there is in the back half of the year as the excess mortality from COVID hope is behind us. And if we assume it remain at these current levels, is it fair to model treatment growth going positive in the fourth quarter? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So, look, I think the right number to look at is not patients but treatments per day. And the good news, let me try and walk you through, first the good news is treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1. And I think a sequential view of it will get you a better model than a year-over-year view. So sequentially treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1 about 400 treatments per day. There is a bunch of things going on in there and so let me try and break it down for you. First, the good news is the new to dialysis treatment starts remain strong. So the question that we\u2019ve gotten in the past about what has happened within the CKD population as a result of COVID, we continue to see strong new to dialysis treatment \u2013 admissions. So we don\u2019t feel any pressure there right now. In terms of Q2 over Q1, Q2 did benefit from the storms in Q1, so you\u2019ll remember the storms in \u2013 from Yuri led to lower treatment volume in Q1. And so the comparison in Q2 was a positive there. That said, there are few things weighing on the quarter. First acute volumes are down as you would expect with the pandemic, getting better in Q2 over Q1. Second, excess mortality remained above normal. It was well below what we saw in Q1 came down from 3,000 approximately to less than 500, but it\u2019s still above normal. And finally, the mix of treatment days in Q2 was unfavorable. We do a fewer treatments on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturdays than we do on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays, and that was about a 50 basis point headwind in Q2 over Q1. So just to summarize, the good news is, we\u2019re back to a situation where treatments are growing quarter-over-quarter, the new to dialysis admissions remained strong. That said, there continues to be a bit of noise in the numbers. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the value-based care. So to Pito\u2019s question, it would be great if you can give us those numbers. And is that going to be just for the government programs? Are you going to be able to \u2013 are you going to also put any kinds of MA value-based contracting, commercial value-based contracting that you have in there that\u2019s above and beyond the dialysis side? Joel Ackerman : Yes, that would include all of that, Justin. It would include MA, it would include traditional Medicare, as well as anything on the commercial side. Justin Lake : Okay. So, that number will be all profitability, I assume. Does that include or exclude spending on dialysis? When you talk about the margin, are you talking about the $60,000 that\u2019s ex-dialysis or you\u2019re talking about the $90,000, $95,000 that includes dialysis when you gross-up for the $2 billion? Joel Ackerman : It includes the dialysis number. Justin Lake : Okay. Joel Ackerman : So the patient number would be more like 100,000 or 90,000 depending on what time period. Justin Lake : Perfect. And you mentioned on the call, in the trend, the press release I should say, that your payer mix changed a little bit to the positive. Can you talk a little bit about commercial volume versus government? Javier Rodriguez : Justin, the reality is, there\u2019s not a lot to say. This is a bit of a numerator, denominator issue. You had more mortality on the Medicare side and the commercial side held strong as people really valued their income and insurance, and so is a lot more resilient than we anticipated. So that\u2019s the dynamic that we\u2019re discussing here. A couple of other things Justin, while you\u2019re asking about the value-based care and how do we calculate it with dialysis and non-dialysis. Yes, I think it\u2019s important to do the math you\u2019re doing, you subtract the dialysis. And then you have to put in there that the payer/government have participation in the savings, the nephrologists then has a participation in the savings and that\u2019s how you trickle down to the percentages, the 1%, 2% or 3% roughly that Joel talked about. Justin Lake : Okay, thanks for that. And can you just give \u2013 can you help me with the commercial treatment growth in the quarter? Joel Ackerman : I can tell you, commercial mix was up about 20 bps in Q2 over Q1. Justin Lake : Okay, great. And then in terms of\u2026 Joel Ackerman : As a reminder, you don\u2019t get as much from that in COVID when your Medicare patients are passing away as you would in a normal time. Justin Lake : Okay. And then just last question on, you mentioned 2022. I apologize if I missed this, but the tax rate change for this year, do you expect that to continue in 2022? Or is this a reasonable new tax rate to assume? Or should we go back to the original guidance and assume that\u2019s the tax rate for 2022? Joel Ackerman : There\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about how it will play out. I think it is reasonable to assume some if not all of the benefit we are seeing this year will continue for another year, but not in perpetuity. So for 2022, yes, 2023 I\u2019d say no. Justin Lake : Okay, thanks for that. I\u2019ll jump back in. Thanks, guys. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : All right, great, thanks. I wanted to dig into this, these investments that you\u2019re making around this value-based care. I just want to make sure the numbers are right. I think you said $120 million this year and then it sounded like you said $50 million. Do you think $50 million incremental so like $170 million or did you mean $120 million goes to $250 million? Joel Ackerman : Incremental. Kevin Fischbeck : Incremental. Okay. Is there \u2013 I guess, as we think about that number; is that a net number? If you start to make a 2% margin on the value-based care, is that an offset to that or is that kind of inclusive of any potential profitability? Joel Ackerman : It\u2019s a net number. Kevin Fischbeck : Net number, okay. And then it sounded like you were saying that the $120 million included the CKCC as well, is that true? And does that number, I guess just sort of think about the $120 million to $170 million and the roll off there, is that all included? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. So, Kevin, the CKCC doesn\u2019t start till the beginning of 2022. But we will start investing in the back half of the year in anticipation of that growth. So it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s expense that we are building in anticipation of growth related to CKCC. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes. Okay. And then as far as the sequential enrollment treatment growth, I guess, to look like, that\u2019s a better way to look at. There\u2019s a lot of puts and takes into that number. I guess what \u2013 once you get back to normal, what should that number look like? I guess like 0.4%, I\u2019m thinking, 1.6% annualized. Like what do you think when this all normalizes, what is the growth rate and volume? Is it a 2% numbers or is it a 3% number. What would it ultimately annualize to? Javier Rodriguez : I think at the end of the day, Kevin, one of the things as you heard from Joel, there\u2019s a lot of different dynamics and interplay for us. The positive is that we\u2019re seeing, let\u2019s call it the new admin stabilize pre-COVID and so the best data we have right now is that we will revert to the pre-COVID numbers. And so I think that\u2019s the best assumption, we keep you posted if that changes. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And it sounds like you\u2019re not really seeing anything on the labor side, a number of companies are complaining about labor pressure. I guess could you talk a bit about what you\u2019re doing there? And then it sounds like you talked about union issues. I think you meant kind of ballot initiatives right not actually labor costs, but more ballot initiatives that might be a pressure next year? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, so let me grab a couple. We\u2019re not going to complain about the pressure, but it\u2019s absolutely there. It is a very dynamic and competitive marketplace. We continue to invest in a differentiated workplace and find that our teammates find great fulfillment in the purpose of the work that we do. That said, again the marketplace is quite dynamic. As it relates to the second question, yes, we are talking about the union might come up with another ballot. And so we\u2019ve now unfortunately, every other year have had to deal with it, we hope that they are a little more empathetic to the fact that we\u2019re in a pandemic in that, it is not a good use of the resources, but we just want to continue to talk about it, so no one surprised. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then last question I guess, as we think about the going to growth in the value-based care opportunity is what you\u2019re doing differentiated. Do you think that there is going to be share shifts as a result of this or other smaller players or midsized players going to struggle to do what you\u2019re doing and you\u2019re resonating with the payers, and so that you actually see a volume lift from this or is this kind of where the industry is going in and your push into this is largely kind of the same so that you wouldn\u2019t expect, it is just really more about the revenue and the margin that it is about gaining share? Javier Rodriguez : It\u2019s an interesting play. From our perspective, we believe that we\u2019re really well-positioned and of course there\u2019s a lot of dynamics on volume and mix, how a patient gets to us all the way from a patient choice to a payer choice to physician. And so that dynamic has got a lot going on, can the whole chain there really see the value that we create, I think that over time the answer will be, yes, because the clinical outcomes will show it. And there\u2019ll be transparency where people say, gosh, if I can live there longer if I can get more transplant, if I can get my CKD and not be hospitalized, I want to go there. But as you know, that takes time. And so, from my perspective right now, I\u2019m not assuming a change in sort of a shift in decision making until this plays out a bit more. Kevin Fischbeck : All right, great, thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lisa Clive from Bernstein. Your line is open ma\u2019am. Lisa Clive : Hi, thanks very much. Apologies if I missed it in the prepared remarks. So what did you say you\u2019re vaccination rate was for your patients and also what is it for your team mates? And second question, have you been giving third doses for selected patients, given that the immune compromised seem to not responded well to the vaccines in terms of the efficacy? And then lastly, are you still testing patients and teammates before every session and just wondering how that is going to evolve in the coming quarters? Javier Rodriguez : All right. But let me grab them and then if I miss anyone want to please come back at me. The patient vaccinated complete with two doses is around 72% or so, teammates is in 68. We\u2019re starting to tracking those people that are intend to get a vaccine and we\u2019re tracking somewhere in the 1% or 2% that are either thinking of getting in their first cycle. To my knowledge there is nothing of significance in the third dosage yet in our population. And so I know that the physician community is discussing it, but I don\u2019t have any major numbers on that. And then what was your last question? Lisa Clive : Just in terms of that\u2026 Javier Rodriguez : Testing, we didn\u2019t test all the patients. I think that was in the assumed question. What we do is, we of course test anyone that has any symptoms. And then of course our patients get tested a lot more because they\u2019re using so much healthcare than when they go to other physician offices or hospitals or other things, they get tested. So they\u2019re disproportionately tested. But we just test when they are symptoms. Lisa Clive : Okay, thanks very much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up here. Linking back to the IKC piece as investors are bit confused on these disclosures, my understanding today as you collect $2 billion of sort of gross revenues, about half of that look in the dialysis costs and the other half are in medical costs or other medical costs. So when you referenced of 1% to 4% margin, that\u2019s on the full $2 billion, so should we think about instead as a 2% to 8% margin on a $1 billion of non-dialysis cost? Javier Rodriguez : Either way works, we\u2019ve decided to standardize on the full cost, but either way is perfectly fine way to do the math. Pito Chickering : Okay, perfect. And then I will make hit one on patient care costs. Obviously, with our investor concern our labor inflation during 2Q, obviously your cost per treatment were down sequentially driven by a number of areas. But as I think about patient care costs over the next couple of years. Can you give us additional color on what can drive further efficiencies here, specifically around center occupancy increasing and the shift in home dialysis? Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Well, let me grab it, as it relates to the inflation, of course, we\u2019ve been very good over time. If you do our CAGR over the last five years or so, I believe we\u2019re right at 1% or so slightly below. And so we view the levers quite thoughtfully over time in there, we are managing an essence pharmaceuticals, we\u2019re managing productivity and of course wage rate and there\u2019s other things like supplies and other miscellaneous items which we are very diligent on. So we don\u2019t think those dynamics will change much other than during COVID of course, the PPE has gone up dramatically and we hope that that stabilizes over time. As it relates to the wage inflation, we have nothing really particular to say about it. We are another player in this really dynamic marketplace and it feels like it\u2019s shifting quite aggressively right now is that a short period or does that sustain itself. So I don\u2019t think I can comment on the multi-year, it is fair to say that we are aggressively looking at all the pharmaceutical and all the options to make sure that our physicians have the choice of their pharmaceutical, but at the best price possible. So I don\u2019t know if I got to all of your questions. I think the last part of it was around capacity utilization and of course we are watching it very aggressively. We went from a time when we were very aggressive on the de novo build to. As you can see, we really tapered that back and we\u2019re building a lot more home centers, which are a lot more capital efficient. We will keep that sort of balance in check, because we know the patients need the interplay between the home and the center and so there needs to be capacity available and as we lost here roughly 5% of our patient during COVID. We are aggressively taking a look at our portfolio to make sure that our patients have access and that we are not having centers that are not the right capacity. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then, sort of last follow-up question for your, on the IKC at least for now. Is it fair to think about the operating income in the dialysis segment being unchanged as you increase your penetration with IKC patients? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, I think that\u2019s fair. We are trying to present this in a way that represents the fact that the business is, they are not independent in so far as they are intricately, they are linked and that\u2019s why we think and we are excited about our opportunity to win in IKC, but trying to present them as separate income statements, if you will. So you can assess how the core historical dialysis business doing and how the new IKC business doing. Pito Chickering : And then last one here. Is it fair to think that kind of as a role just for third quarter results that you be able to give us additional disclosures in the press release around this sort of new segment or division? Javier Rodriguez : We are taking a careful look about what\u2019s the right level of disclosure as the IKC business grows and making sure the shareholders have a good understanding of the economics of the business, the progress, the investment, the spending et cetera, so more to come on where we land on that. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much guys. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time. Javier Rodriguez : Okay, well thank you Missy, let me make a couple of closing comments. Number one, our core business is strong. Number two, we are entering an exciting and dynamic time with an opportunity to deliver a lot of value for our patients by connecting and coordinating their care with payers, nephrologist and providers. Point three, the clinical and the economic prices are absolutely meaningful and like most valuable prices, there is a lot to do to make the plan a reality. Point four, if for whatever reason we cannot accomplish the desired outcomes the economic risk is limited structurally, because there are termination rights and off-ramps. So in summary, there is a big price with limited downside. So hopefully that helps you think of how we\u2019re thinking about, sorry that lets you understand a little of how we\u2019re thinking about it. We thank you for your support and we enter this new chapter together. Be well, everyone. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time and thank you for joining.",

For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and any subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim and good afternoon. Q3 was another strong quarter for DaVita in the face of a challenging operating environment. Despite another rise in COVID case counts across the United States and an increasingly challenging labor market, we continue to provide quality care to our patients and execute on our strategic objectives. I want to begin my remarks by highlighting an exciting milestone, we took past 15% of our patients dialyzing at home. This means that approximately 30,000 of our patients receive the clinical and lifestyle benefits of home dialysis. As we've explained before, to be sustainable provider home dialysis, it requires a comprehensive infrastructure, including convenient and easy access to a home center for training sessions, and recurring visits with our care team. Our current network of centers provides that easy access such that 80% of our dialysis patients live within 10 miles of a DaVita home center. In addition, we continue to innovate on our platform to help make home dialysis, an easier choice for patients and their physicians and to extend the duration on home dialysis once patients have made that choice. A few highlights of note. First, we recently rolled out an enhanced education program along with supporting technology for our new patients to ensure that they receive timely and comprehensive modality education, which is tailored to each patient's individual needs. We also continue to work on additional enhancements and customization to our education process for different communities, such as black and Hispanic patients to improve their chance of selecting this modality and therefore improve health equity. Second, we developed a patient portal and telemedicine platform that supports remote monitoring and communications between DaVita caregivers, our nephrologist partners, and our home patients. Third, we developed a team of industry-leading home physicians to create an expert network, which works closely with practicing physicians and practice leaders to help them understand the benefits of home modalities, troubleshooting complex clinical issues and elevate their home clinical skill. Last, we're testing out our AI and other technologies to optimize PD prescription, alerting physicians in real time when an update prescription might be needed. We will discuss the strategic advantage of our platform in greater detail on November 16 on our Virtual Capital Markets Day. On to our Q3 results. Our business model continues to prove resilient in face of operating challenges. Q3 operating income grew approximately 9% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 31% over the same period However, the ongoing COVID pandemic continues to take its toll on too many human lives in the world at large, and amongst our patients. Across the broad US population, the current surge driven by the Delta variant appears to have peaked in early September, with new case accounts reaching approximately two-thirds of the peak during the past winner. Fortunately, within our dialysis patient population, the new case count peaked approximately one-third of the winner peak and mortality rates were relatively lower, likely due to the vaccination rates amongst our patients. Incremental mortality increased from fewer than 500 in Q2 to approximately 2000 in Q3. After quarter end, COVID infections continue to decline, with our new case count during the week ending October 16 down by approximately 60%, relative to the recent Delta peak. Switching to vaccines, approximately 73% of our patients have now been vaccinated. In addition, we've started the rollout of vaccine boosters for eligible patients in accordance with CDC guidelines. We're hopeful that any future COVID surges and breakthrough infections will be more limited relative to what we saw in the peak of last winter. Shifting to cost. Cost management continued to be strong in the quarter, although we are facing the same competitive dynamics in the market for healthcare workers, as other companies have mentioned. Despite these challenges, I am pleased with how our frontline leadership team has been responding. It has long been a key part of our mission to be the employer of choice. How we live this aspect of our mission has been evident throughout the pandemic, as our team has retained relentless focus on the safety and care of our patients, as well as one another. As we have discussed in past calls, we continue to offer a safe and fulfilling work environment and have provided incremental pay and benefits to help our frontline caregivers during this challenging time. These efforts are ongoing. Given the current environment, we expect to provide our teammates with higher annual compensation increases than in typical years. This will put additional pressures on our cost structure but we believe this will help us attract and retain the talent needed to achieve our long-term objective. Just as critical, it aligns with our mission and builds on our history of investing in our people. Finally, I would like to say a few words about Integrated Kidney Care or IKC. Last quarter, we shared details on our planned investment in IKS and long-term opportunity this creates for patients, payers and our shareholders. At the end of Q3, we now have over 22,000 patients in some form of integrated care arrangements, representing 1.7 billion of value-based care contracts. Next year, we expect to approximately double the size of our IKC business driven primarily by our participation in the federal government's news cheap KCC program. While it is still early and contingent on successful execution, we believe that investing in IKC represents a new and potentially meaningful earnings opportunity for us in the coming years. This is another area we plan to discuss in detail at our upcoming Virtual Capital Markets Day. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for more details on the quarter. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. Despite the operating challenges Javier referenced, we delivered another quarter of strong results. Operating income was $475 million and earnings per share was $2.36. Our Q3 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $55 million, an increase relative to the quarterly impact that we experienced in the first half of the year. As Javier mentioned, the latest COVID surge resulted in excess mortality in the quarter of approximately 2000 compared to fewer than 500 in Q2. We're also anticipating the mortality in Q4 to be higher than it was in Q2, although we've seen a decrease in the last few weeks that we hope continues. Our current view of the OI impact of COVID for the year is worse by approximately $40 million compared to our expectations from last quarter. For 2021, we now expect a total net COVID impact of approximately $210 million. Treatments per day were down by 536 or 0.6% in Q3 compared to q2. The primary headwind was the increase in our estimated excess mortalities and higher mistreatment as a result of the COVID surge. In addition, the quarter had a higher ratio of Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, which lowered treatments per day for the quarter by approximately 300. In light of the current Delta surge, and the compounding impact of mortalities on our year-over-year growth, we believe that the timing of a return to positive nag will now be delayed into 2022. Revenue per treatment was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, patient care cost per treatment was up approximately $5 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher teammate compensation and benefit expenses. This is the result of higher wages, additional training costs associated with an increase in our new hires and seasonality in healthcare benefit expenses, which we expect to continue into Q4. Our Integrated Kidney Care business saw an improvement in its operating loss in the quarter, which is due primarily to positive prior period development in our special needs plan. We continue to expect increased costs in Q4, especially in our projected CKCC markets, as we ramp up staffing in preparation for 2022. DSOs for our US dialysis and lab business increased by approximately three days quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to fluctuations in the timing of billing and collections. Other loss for the quarter was 7.6 million, primarily due to a $9 million decline in the mark to market of our investment in Miromatrix. The value of this investment at quarter end was $14 million. Now turning to some updates for the rest of the year and beyond. As I mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, we excluded any impact of a significant surge in COVID from the Delta variant in our revised guidance, but noted that a wider range of outcomes was possible depending in part on how a fourth surge would develop. Now that we've seen the impact of the Delta surge, we are increasing our estimate of COVID impact for the year by $40 million. Given where we are in the year, we are now incorporating this COVID impact into our revised adjusted OI guidance of $1.76 billion to $1.81 billion. We are also narrowing our guidance for adjusted EPS to $8.80 to $9.15 per share. And we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, although there is some chance that our free cash flow may fall below the bottom end of the range, depending on the timing of our DSO recovery. Our revised OI guidance implies a decline in our Q4 financial performance relative to Q3. This is partially explained by the incremental COVID mortality impact, and by expected higher salaries and wages for existing frontline teammates. Our guidance anticipates Q4 operating income to be negatively impacted by approximately $75 million of seasonally high or one-time items, including certain compensation expenses, elevated training costs, higher health benefit expenses, and G&A. Looking ahead to 2022, the three expected headwinds I talked about on the Q2 earnings call remain. As a reminder, we expect to have added expense related to the greatest portion of the industry effort to counter the ballot initiative in California. We anticipate a year-over-year incremental investment in the range of $15 million as we continue to grow our ITC business. And we will also begin depreciating our new clinical IP platform, which we expect to be approximately $40 million. A few additional things to help you with our thinking about 2022. COVID remains a big uncertainty. We are anticipating the end of the temporary sequestration suspension, which would be a $70 million headwind for the full year. We also expect that some of the costs that spiked during COVID, in particular PPE, may not return as quickly to pre-COVID levels due to the challenges of the global supply chain. Finally, COVID impact on mortality next year remains a large swing factor. Another winter surge would negatively impact treatment volume and could delay the timing of achieving positive NAG. However, if the recent surge proves to be the last significant COVID search, then we would expect a tailwind from lower than typical mortality, which could result in treatment growth higher than pre-COVID level. In 2022, we expect net labor costs will increase more than in typical years as a result of market pressures. Our current estimate is a net headwind of $50 million to $75 million. We expect to offset a significant amount of these incremental costs, with continuing MA penetration growth above historical level, and strong management of non-labor patient care costs. From an operating income growth perspective, we expect 2022 will be a transition year with some significant but largely temporary headwinds to get through, after which we expect our platform to continue to support strong profit growth. While the range of potential outcomes for 2022 is broad, a reasonable scenario could result in an OI decline of $150 million from our 2021 guidance. This includes the impact from the expected ballot initiative, IKC and the increased depreciation. This scenario also includes a modest headwind from COVID, although there are scenarios where the impact of COVID could be significantly worse. Looking forward to 2023, we anticipate a reversal of the net impact of these 2022 headwinds, plus incremental operating income growth, such that we expect 2023 operating income to show a low-to-mid single digit CAGR from the midpoint of our updated 2021 guidance, which would be in line with the multi-year outlook we have shared historically. We expect this to be the result of the lack of ballot initiative-related costs, the recognition of savings in IKC, an improved COVID situation, and continued growth of the core business. We'll have more to say about long term guidance at our Capital Markets Day in a couple of weeks. Finally, during the third quarter, we repurchase 2.7 million shares of our stock and in October to date, we repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Justin Lake from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks and thanks for all the color here. Let's start on the fourth quarter. You're talking about - it sounds like most of the 40 million of incremental COVID costs are actually happening in the fourth quarter, is that correct? Javier Rodriguez : Most yes, but there was some in Q3 as well. So I would think of Q3 as 55 million and if you take the number we gave for COVID, for the full year, what would be left is about 85 million for Q4. Justin Lake : Okay. And then can you help us on the mortality side what you're seeing there? And how much of that 40 million are - maybe we even talked about the 75 million that you talked about serves a higher cost, how much of that's coming from mortality? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, so what we've seen in mortality is a pickup in Q3 to about 2000 excess mortality. Remember, we were below 500 in Q2, and there's no doubt that Delta surge has come on bigger than we expected. And we expect that to continue into Q4 a bit. So if you look at - if you're trying to triangulate in on growth, what you see for the quarter, Q3 over Q2 is treatment growth per day that's down a bit that's largely the result of the excess mortality. Also, there were more Tuesday, Thursday, Saturdays than Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, and that was about a 300 treatment per day headwind in the quarter as well. So that's the - those are the numbers behind it. In terms of the financial impact from COVID, what you're seeing is definitely the excess mortality that hits in Q3, it hits even harder in Q4. You're also seeing some increase in mistreatments, which we've seen in prior surges and we're anticipating in Q4 again, and then you also see some increased labor costs associated with cohorting and stuff like that. So that's how I'd lay out the impact of mortality and other things on COVID in Q3 and Q4. Justin Lake : Okay, and then, in terms of the 75 million, is any of that - or it sounds like some portion of that is one time, so this is not that the kind of implied Q4 OI. Is that a reasonable run rate or is there , the kind of jump off of, or is there some one-time costs within that 75 million that kind of jump you off a bigger base? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, so I would think of the 75 is coming in two forms, either one-time or seasonal pickups. The one-time things, I call out are some comp bonus type stuff and then training is up when we hire new teammates that tends to lead to a higher training number. So those are the one-time things in the 75 and then there are some seasonal items. There's a seasonal benefit impact in Q4, and also a seasonal increase in G&A. Those are things we tend to see in most years and they're a bit exaggerated this year, as a result of the patterns resulting from COVID. But to get to your fundamental question of what's a good jumping off point, for next year, I think the full year number for 2021 is a reasonable baseline off of which to jump off for next year. If you took Q4 and adjusted for the 75 million, you'd get to about the same spot. Justin Lake : Got it. If I could squeeze in one more, you talked out to 2023 and a lot of this stuff makes sense in terms of kind of transitory costs. But you talked about two pieces here. IKC savings, right, so you talked about 2022, you could have $50 million of incremental losses. How much better does IKC, with the tailwind in '23 there? And then you talked about improved COVID, can you talk about the tailwind there in terms of sizing? That'd be really helpful. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. So I'll start with a caveat that 2023 is a long way away and we're even cautious about talking about '22, given the uncertainty. So I wouldn't think of this as guidance but just some reasonable estimates to help you think things through. So on IKC, I think a $50 million reversal of the headwind we're seeing in '22 is a reasonable way to think about '23. So basically, winding up in '23, about where we are in '21. COVID is really, really hard to think about. That said, if you assume that COVID disappears at some point next year. I think the right way to think about it, and now I'm bridging basically from '21 to '23 is we've got a $70 million sequestration suspension. That becomes a tailwind, right. We're getting all of that in '21 that goes away in '22 and stays away forever, so there's a $70 million headwind there. We've got roughly a comparable number of net expenses associated with COVID. Think about labor, think about the increased spend on PPE, with some offset related to T&E primarily and that net number is a $70 million number today, so as that dissipates, what you've really got is effectively a tailwind from that, that offsets the headwind from sequestration and what you're left with is mortality. And mortality today is on a run rate basis, somewhere in the $240 million number and what we would expect is over some long period of time, four, five, six, seven years for that number to go to zero. So as that $240 million headwind we've got today dissipates, then you would see that coming back into earnings over time. So that's the COVID story. Justin Lake : Thanks for all that. Great, thank you. Joel Ackerman : And then I'll just add one thing, as you're finishing your bridge. Justin, don't forget that there's a $60 million California ballot that's going to be in '22 - sorry, yeah in '22 that won't be in '23. So, there is another couple numbers to bridge to. Justin Lake : Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Okay, Michelle. Operator : Thank you. Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America, you may go ahead, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. One or two follow up on the last question. That mortality number, until I guess you're talking about four to maybe seven years of getting that back, I guess that might be a little bit longer than I might have thought of a time period to think about that number coming back anyway. Anyway, why wouldn't it be something more like three years rather than four to seven? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. So, Kevin, first of all, you might be right and I think there's likely to be a tail to it, right. And we don't know how long that tail is but there is certainly a very reasonable scenario where most of that bounce back comes out - comes back quicker, certainly quicker than seven years and potentially quicker than four years. So it probably doesn't come back evenly over whatever number you choose and I think there's reasonable logic to say you get more early on in that period, and the tail gets a little thin towards the end. So I say you could be right in terms of getting most of it in three years. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, that's helpful. And then I think you mentioned that because of the COVID spike, you now don't expect NAG to get back to positive until next year. I forget what I guess maybe I don't remember if you said that you thought it was going to happen by year end or not? But I guess, is that how we should think about it, that you had the last spike in Q1, and then you thought you might have able to get back to positive by your end and now that we have one in Q3, maybe three quarters later, we'll get the positive NAG is that the right waiting period or - Joel Ackerman : I think that's, that's a good start for thinking about it. Although this the size of the spike also impacts how long it takes us to get back to a positive NAG, because if the spike is lower, a natural growth can kind of overcome that in a shorter period of time. As I've said, I think on prior calls, I've found thinking about quarter-over-quarter treatment per day patterns to be a much easier way to think about what's going to happen to our volumes, and then ultimately, revenue over the next few years, NAG can be a little bit of a clunky number, when in times like this where there's so much volatility. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then the last question, you mentioned, kind of doubling the size of IKC. And it's not like a big portion that with a government program, I guess, is there a way to break out your view about growth in MA versus the new program? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. Well, right now, what we're seeing is that more patients are reviewing their insurance and selecting MA and so if you were to look at the broader population, I think the last number I saw in non-kidney is around 43% of patients are choosing MA our number is now getting close to that, we're roughly around 41%. And so as MA grows, of course, that's likely to be a big feeder into the risk because those plans are coming to us and wanting to contract. As it relates to the government, we are in the final stages here of sizing the practices that are really going to enroll and therefore attribute their patient but our estimates have been both doubling roughly from what we have now and we'll give you information as it plays out. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And but again, so MA has already kind of at penetration. The doubling then is from just moving contracts with MA plans that you already have from a fee for service to IKC type structure? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. Yeah. So more plans are wanting to have IKC type structures, correct. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then this last question on that on this then. Is there anything different, are these contracts coming together quickly? So the thing about timing of all this stuff, this year is the first year so I could see a lot of companies dragging their feet, would you expect to largely have penetrated that contract opportunity within MA plans or what percentage of your MA contracts would be this type of arrangement next year? And when will we expect to see the vast majority of them be that type of arrangement? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, I think it's specific by payer, it's quite customized, as we all know, payers have different strategies and different cadences as to where they put their focus. Again, the range of contracts and structures from anywhere from fee for service, paid to performance, gain shared, shared risk, all the way to full risk is basically customized by payer. So the cadence is really customized, we're ready to go and so we're talking to them and there's nothing really interesting to report on timing, per se. It's steady and constant. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, so it's not like a huge drop next year, it's constant growth and increasing that members when you think about it? Javier Rodriguez : We're not forecasting any drastic change. Kevin Fischbeck : Got it. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. It's taking the questions, a follow up to Justin's questions and forgive me, there are a lot of numbers sort of on this call. If you take the midpoint of like guidance for 2021 and put a 4% CAGR on that, for 2023, you get to that 1.93 billion of operating income. How much that comes from IKC versus core dialysis and how does IKC change the low to mid single digit CAGR of OI going forward? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, so in terms of how much of the OI in '23 comes from IKC, again, with all the caveats about uncertainty and everything else, you're really going to see no change in OI and I KC from '21 to '23. That's, again - that's a reasonable scenario from where we are. So if you think about, OI growth, total OI growth '21 to '23, you basically see a zero in that scenario from IKC. Pito Chickering : Okay. So that sort of 4% OI growth for CAGR of next two years, as hundreds is coming from core dialysis at this point. And even the - Joel Ackerman : I think, Pito, the right way to think about it is, it's largely coming from core dialysis. There, we've called out a bunch of headwinds and tailwinds, the ones from ballots and IKC kind of offset each other, so they're net zero. The depreciation from our new clinical IP system stays with us and you'll have a tailwind from COVID. Pito Chickering : Okay, but so let me just work these numbers for a second. If I take again the OI from this year, that's embedding $120 million of losses from IKC. You're saying that by 2023, it will still run $120 million of losses through the P&L on the IKC? Joel Ackerman : Right. What we're effectively saying is 120 in 2021, goes to 170 next year, and that's the one of the big headwinds for next year, and that reverses itself in '23. Pito Chickering : Okay. So the full 170 reverses or just a 50 reverses. I mean, just the - Joel Ackerman : No, just the 50. Pito Chickering : Okay, got it. Joel Ackerman : Ultimately our expectation would be the full 150 would reverse itself and the business would become profitable, but it wouldn't happen all in '23. Pito Chickering : Okay. And from our labor side, as you start think about [indiscernible] costs for treatment, how much of this is transitory from premium labor versus wage inflation, which will continue in 2020? Can you remind us to what your normal wage inflation was and kind of what was your thinking about for 3Q and 4Q? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, so, the numbers in Q3 and Q4, there is some wage inflation, but where you're really going to start seeing that is next year and I know I went through a lot of numbers quickly in the script. What we call all doubt, at the beginning of the call was a 50 million to 75 million net labor headwind next year and that would be wages, it would be training, and there could be potential offsets from benefits or productivity and stuff like that. But if I think the right number for next year is a net headwind, given the challenging labor environment of 50 million to 75 million. Pito Chickering : Okay, fair enough. For IKC, will you plan a breakout for the revenues and costs per patients at some point, so we can help model out how that's tracking? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, I think we're on a bit of a path to continue to create a disclosure package around IKC that will give shareholders the visibility they need into our progress. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then the last question for me, there's a billion dollars of cash sitting on the balance sheets right now, how much cash do you guys need to run the core dialysis and now, the new IKC that grows in 2022? And how much we think about that going back to this repo at this point? Thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Yeah, so I would think about us typically needing somewhere around $300 million of cash on the balance sheet just to run the business. I don't think that number will change significantly with IKC, we're not a regulated entity. We don't have statutory capital requirements. Pito Chickering : Okay, so that's fair to think about, $300 million excess cash [indiscernible] sooner rather than later. Javier Rodriguez : I'd say yes, on the 700 million of excess cash. Look, we clearly been buyers of the stock. We bought more than usual, since the last earnings call. As we've said in the past, we're not agnostic on price. If we'd like to price, we will buy more. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you, Sarah James from Barclays, you may go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. And I appreciate all of the color about '22 as a whole but I'm hoping that you could give us a little bit more on the cadence of how the year will roll out. So some of those headwinds, are they starting at the beginning of the year, and later on? And then on the labor cost side, we've heard some of the key guys talking about labor costs improving in the back half of the year, and just wasn't sure if that's what you were anticipating in your guidance as well. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. So on labor timing, I don't think we have a particular view about the macro economy in the labor market, and how that's going to play out. So I don't have anything to add there. IKC, I think you'll see a lot of that starting in the beginning of the year, you'll actually start seeing some of that in Q4, but it certainly could build up over the course of the year. If the ballot initiative is similar to what we've seen historically, it's plays out largely in Q3, although there can be pieces in other quarters. The depreciation number I've talked about is probably likely to be more of a back half of the year event, you might see some in Q2, but it'll be back end loaded. And COVID is complicated, the sequestration, assuming it goes away will happen on 1/1, so there'll be a big hit are related to that, starting in January, how exactly the other costs rollout, hard to predict. Although net-net, you'd probably see that improving as the year goes on, although not that big a number. And I'm not sure how to even help you with the mortality figure. Historically, even when mortality comes down, it still accumulates. Next year, if there is no winter wave and COVID overall begins to go away, I think you'd expect to see that starting to improve over the course of the year. I hope that helps. Sarah James : No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And just one more here on labor. Can you give us any more color on where you're seeing that labor pressure most acutely? So is it in a certain skill level or type of position that you're seeing it and then how material is that class of employee to your overall FWD expenses? Joel Ackerman : Sarah, I wish we could point to one but the reality is, while it is more acute in certain geographies, it is very widespread and across most of our clinical teammates, and so it is wide and many geographies. Sarah James : Got it. Thank you very much. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next caller is Lisa Clive from Bernstein. You may go ahead. Lisa Clive : Hi, two questions for me. Just on the wage inflation, so Medicare is obviously inevitably delayed in how their rate updates come through. Could you just give us some information on the rate adjusters in your private contracts? Is it similar to Medicare where they're set once a year and are looking at metrics that are somewhat backdated? And then the second question on integrated care, the $120 million of losses still in 2023. I'm just trying to understand this and really sort of thinking about scaling up that program. CKCC is obviously one major driver. How big do you envisage that program getting and I suppose what does the ramp up look like? Javier Rodriguez : Let me grab the first part and then Joel can supplement. First in case it's useful, Medicare has a basket update and the way it's calculated is not looking at pure dialysis and what's happening to cost either retrospective or prospectively. Rather, there's an economic firm that forecasts inflation and then they subtract what they call a productivity adjustment, which in essence, is a 10 year average that's trying to measure the efficiency of the economy. So as you can imagine, that's got some complexity. As it relates to the commercial business, the way it's done is usually through a negotiated way. And so every single one of them is negotiated individually, and the timing tends to be effective whenever the contract was signed. And so if you think of a contract that was signed in February, usually, the annual escalator would be done in February of the next year. That's the most traditional way of doing it. Of course, there can be other ways that have a pay for performance or other mechanisms. But in general, that's how that works. As it relates to your second question on CKCC, the short answer is we don't know. For right now, it's a CMMI pilot and so it's authorized for two years. Of course, the intent is to try it out and see if it's effective and if it works for the system and if we're doing well by the patient and then I would assume that then Medicare would try to extend it. We try to think of a world where hopefully, you get to somewhere in that 30,000 patients in one way or another being through MA or a CMMI vehicle but we will see. Lisa Clive : Thanks for that. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Lisa. Operator : And our next caller is Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys, thanks a follow up here. I sort of want to go back to the IKC losses in 2023. I'm struggling a little bit in terms of losses, you guys are assuming that we'll have there. When the ESCO program has been running, it was so savings right out of the gate. How can you say while we'll still see $120 million in IKC three years out when ESCO is profitable on your one? Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Well, let me just grab the high level and then Joel, you can separate with numbers. The best way to think of the ESCO is actually not that they were profitable, but what the non-dialysis savings are actually quite good. But then of course, you have to apply the operating model and then you have to load the G&A. And now in the model that we have, we also have to share with partners and so that's how the number sort of trickles down and you have to get to scale. And so a good way of thinking is that once you do all that and you go through all those iterations, you probably will get to a low-single digit OI number and depending if you're grabbing non-dialysis, I would think of it somewhere in the 3-ish percent or so if you're thinking of the entire number, it's 1.5 or so because it's roughly half dialysis and half the other - the other non-dialysis costs. But in the ESCOs, when you fully load them, we didn't make money, rather, people were measuring whether it was effective at reducing non-dialysis costs. Joel Ackerman : Yeah, Pito, the thing I'd add there, how do you paint the kind of the end game there, the question is, how do you get there, and the thing I would remind you is the costs all come up front. You're paying for the model of care to deliver the savings, you're paying for the G&A, you're building capabilities, the revenue is delayed. And we won't see any revenue in year one, year two, we'll start to see some, but the number will grow over time as the effectiveness of the shared savings continues to grow. So there is not a good matching of revenue and costs, especially in the in years. So part of it is the investment in the scale that Javier talked about, part of it is the delay in the revenue. Pito Chickering : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Gary Taylor from Cowen, you may go ahead, sir. Gary Taylor : Hey, good afternoon. Just three quick ones, Joel, did you ever give us the quarterly step up in depreciation that you've mentioned a few times, but I don't know that I have it quantified for the current system? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, it's 40 million is the annualized number, Gary and it'll probably start sometime in Q2, but you'll see most of it in Q3 and Q4. Gary Taylor : Okay. Just making the note. The other is anything happening on - you cited of commercial - favorable commercial mix a couple quarters in a row? Is there anything happening there besides the Medicare mortality that's changing it, that's worth calling out? Joel Ackerman : No, I think there's been a very much an appreciation during the pandemic that people want to keep their insurance and they value it, and so it's been very resilient and constant. Gary Taylor : Got it. And then my last one is going back to - Joel, going back to 2023, so if we take 2021, we walk it down 150 million, but then we're getting back to low to mid single digit CAGR and towards lat one nine and change for 2023. That's about a 300 million, step up from '22 to '23. So the parts of that would be an incremental 50 million IKC, 60 million reduction advocacy spend, some low to mid single digit organic, and then the rest of that whole would be some portion of this gross COVID mortality and direct expenses coming down. Is that the big part of it? Joel Ackerman : You got it exactly right. Gary Taylor : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Lisa Clive from Bernstein, you may go ahead. Lisa Clive : Hi, there. Just wanted to follow up on the private contracting. In terms of the structure of how the rate increases work, so if you have a, say, four year contract, are the rate adjustments for all four years fully fixed at the outset or is there any ability for those rate adjustments to increase if there is higher inflation as you're clearly experiencing now or are they just fully set as a percentage increase and that's over the course of the contract? Javier Rodriguez : Most of them are fixed lease. So some of them you have to earn your way to them, so they can fluctuate year-over-year depending on performance, but most of them are fixed. Lisa Clive : Okay, but they would vary based on performance, not on your underlying cost structure. Javier Rodriguez : Correct. Sometimes, you could have, of course, something that's linked to an index or something like that, but in general, it's defined and understood. Lisa Clive : Okay, that's clear. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Michelle. Well, we've covered a lot, so let me just try to summarize as cleanly as I can. Three takeaways; number one, our core business is strong; number two, 2022 will have a lot of temporary OI decreases that will correct back to historical OI in '23; and then point three, our teams are working really hard on innovation to deliver on the integrated care dream. We look forward to discussing our strategy in more detail on November 16, during our capital markets day, and talk to you then. Be well everyone Operator : And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference. Jim Gustafson : Thank you, and welcome, everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in the company. I\u2019m Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and all subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and any subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements, except as may be required by law.  Additionally, we\u2019d like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Jim and thank you, all for joining today to call to discuss our fourth quarter performance and our thought on 2022. Each quarter for the last two years, I hope it\u2019s the last time that the pandemic is the start of my discussions with you, yet COVID continues to evolve and have a direct impact on our world, especially on our healthcare system. Similar to what\u2019s been seen in the general population, COVID infections within our patient population spiked significantly in late December through January. At its peak, during the second week of January, the new case count was more than twice as high as of peak from last winter. Gratefully, the mortality rate to date, with the latest surge, has been lower than in prior surges. For the fourth quarter, we estimate that the incremental mortality due to COVID was approximately 1100 compared to approximately 1600 during the third quarter.  Despite the challenges associated with COVID, I continue to be in awe at the resilience and dedication of our teammates across the DaVita Village, from our direct patient caregivers to our corporate teammates, all are unrelenting in their commitment to provide a high-quality care, respond to quickly changing environment, and show incredible compassion and support for our patients.  For the balance of my remarks, I will cover five topics; transplant, labor market, our supply chain, Integrated Kidney Care, IKC, and then I will wrap up with our fourth quarter results and our outlook. First, transplants, at our Capital Markets Day presentation in November, I discussed our focus on innovation to improve the patient experience at every single stage along the patient\u2019s kidney care journey from delaying the progression of kidney disease to transplant and from acute hospital care to dialysis at home or in center. Transplant is a preferred treatment option for most of our patients. And during 2021, despite the challenges posed by the COVID pandemic, we celebrated with nearly 8000 DaVita patients receive the transplant, exceeding our pre-pandemic level.  With that said, the transplant process is long and complicated, with an average wait time of between four and five years for an organ. Staying active on the waitlist for such a long time is difficult. As a result, patients sometimes miss their window for a transplant. We\u2019ve been working to address some of these challenges through our industry-leading transplant smart education program and our partnership with the NKF to help more patients find living donors.  In early January, we announced the acquisition of MedSleuth, who software enables closer partnerships and better coordination between transplant centers, nephrologists, and kidney care providers, with all three working together to support our patient transplant journey. These efforts can also benefit another meaningful goal of ours, to improve health equity. Many process and outcome results in transplant are quite inequitable, different by race and ethnicity, economic means, and insurance coverage. We believe it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Removing barriers to access, making process as easy as possible and providing strong care coordination and support through the transplant journey can all contribute to making transplant not just more available, but also more equitable for our patients.  Now, let me shift to an update on the labor market. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be part of DaVita Village for over 20 years and in all that time, across my many roles, I\u2019ve never experienced the labor market as challenging as we face today. To help deal with the challenge, we have provided incremental pay and benefits to help our frontline caregivers during COVID. We\u2019ve also accelerated wage increases with a particular focus on our teammates in the clinics. As previously communicated, we expect higher than usual wage increases in 2022, which will put some additional pressure on our cost structure going forward. We believe this investment in our people will contribute to our ability to track and retain the talent needed to achieve our long-term objective. That said, the labor markets remain highly dynamic and will continue to be a swing factor for the year.  Over the years, in particular, during the pandemic and natural disasters, we have navigated many supply chain challenges. Today, our supply chain has proven very resilient. Currently, we\u2019re working through a supply shortage primarily related to dialysate, which is a fluid solution used in hemodialysis to filter toxins and fluid from the blood. The shortage has rippled through the entire kidney care community and as a community, we have once again come together in support of our dialysis patients, and thus far have been able to provide uninterrupted life sustaining care. We expect that these challenges related to dialysis will remain with us until the second quarter.  Turning now to IKC, we now have confirmation on the market where we will partner with physicians under the federal government new five years CKCC demonstration. These programs added approximately 12,000 [indiscernible] patients and an additional 12,000 CKD patients across 11 value-based programs in different markets. We are engaging with our nephrologist partners to develop personalized care plan for each covered patient and identify opportunities to improve clinical outcomes and lower costs for each patient. Participating in these and other programs will more than double the number of patients we serve in value-based care arrangement.  In light of our upfront costs of these programs and the lack of shared savings payment, as we discussed in November, we continue to expect that our operating loss in 2022 in our US ancillary segments will increase by approximately 50 million, although this could increase or decrease depending on the number of new arrangements we enter into during the year. We believe that we are well-positioned for the future and in particular, to deliver positive clinical and financial results in our IKC business over the long term. Now, let me finish with fourth quarter results in our updated outlook. Despite the negative impact of the Omicron surge, our fourth quarter results were slightly above the midpoint of our revised guidance. This resulted in a full year adjusted operating income increase of approximately 3% over 2020. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew by approximately 26% year-over-year, and we generated more than 1.1 billion of free cash flow, which we largely deployed to return capital to our shareholders. For 2022, we expect adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.675 billion. The midpoint of this guidance range is 35 million below our expectation from Capital Markets Day last November, which is primarily driven by our updated views on COVID and labor costs. As we said previously, while 2022 will be a transition year due to some near-term investment and challenges that we\u2019re facing, we continue to believe that we\u2019re well positioned to perform across the kidney care continuum in the years to come. We still believe we can deliver the long-term compounded annual growth of adjusted operating income of 3% to 7% that we discussed at Capital Markets Day.  With that, I will turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. As Javier mentioned, our fourth quarter results were slightly above the middle point of our revised guidance. Q4 results included a net COVID headwind of approximately $80 million, an increase relative to the quarterly impact that we experienced in the first three quarters of the year, primarily due to the impact of the incremental mortality from the Delta surge in Q3 and some temporary labor cost increases. For the year, we experienced a net COVID headwind of approximately $200 million. As Javier said, the incremental mortality due to COVID in the fourth quarter was approximately 1100 compared to approximately 1600 in Q3. While it\u2019s too early to accurately forecast incremental mortality in 2022, given a significant uptick in infections in January, we expect COVID-driven mortality in the first quarter to be at or above what we experienced in Q4. US dialysis treatments per day were down 135, or 0.1% in Q4 compared to Q3. The primary headwind was the increasing mortality and higher missed treatments, as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. US dialysis patient care costs per treatment were up approximately $6 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the increased wage rates and health benefit expenses. Our Integrated Kidney Care business saw an increase in its operating loss in Q4, which is due primarily to positive prior periods development in our Special Needs Plans recognized in the third quarter, an increase costs occurred in Q4, including preparation for new value-based care arrangements effective in 2022.  Our adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita was 16% for the fourth quarter and approximately 22% for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate was lower quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to a favorable resolution of a state tax issue during Q4. Finally, in 2021, we repurchased 13.9 million shares of our stock, reducing our shares outstanding by 11.5% during the year. We have repurchased to date an additional 1.4 million shares in 2022.  Now looking ahead to 2022. Our adjusted OI guidance is a range of $1.525 billion to $1.675 billion and our adjusted EPS guidance is $7.50 to $8.50 per share. The midpoint of the OI guidance range is $35 million below the $1.635 billion that we discussed during our recent Capital Markets Day due to offsetting puts and takes. First, we have a tailwind from both higher final Medicare rate update, as well as a partial extension of Medicare sequestration relief. However, this is more than offset by headwinds due to the recent COVID surge as well as incremental wage rate pressure.  At the midpoint of our guidance range, we have incorporated the following assumptions related to COVID. Excess patient mortalities due to COVID of 6000. This, along with our normal growth drivers, would result in a total treatment growth range of approximately 0.5% to 1%. A year-over-year improvement to various COVID-driven costs, such as PPE, which will be largely offset by the loss of revenue from Medicare sequestration relief beyond Q2 2022. As you would expect, the high and low end of our guidance incorporates a range of COVID scenarios for 2022. There are scenarios that could lead us to performance above or below this range. In addition to COVID, the expected headwinds I talked about on the Q3 earnings call and then our Capital Markets Day remain. As a reminder, we expect to incur expenses related to DaVita\u2019s portion of the industry effort to counter the expected ballot initiative in California. Our guidance assumes an incremental increase of between $100 million and $125 million in labor costs, above a typical year\u2019s increase, which is $50 million higher than what we communicated at Capital Markets Day.  Third, we anticipate a year-over-year incremental operating loss in the range of $50 million, as we continue to invest to grow our IKC business. And fourth, we will also begin to depreciate our new clinical IP platform, which we expect to be approximately $35 million in 2022 and we\u2019ll begin in Q2.  A few additional things to help you with our current thinking about 2022. We expect to offset a significant amount of these incremental costs with continuing MA penetration growth above historical levels and strong management of non-labor patient care costs. We are forecasting our tax rate at 25% to 27%, due to non-deductibility of valid expense. Regarding seasonality, remember that Q1 has seasonally higher payroll taxes and seasonal impacts of co-payments and deductibles. The vast majority of our ballot related expenses will fall in Q3. We have historically experienced higher G&A in Q4. Looking past 2022, we continue to expect compounded annual OI growth relative to 2021 of 3% to 7% and compounded annual adjusted EPS growth relative to 2021 of 8% to 14%. Finally, we expect free cash flow of $850 million to $1.1 billion in 2022. As we communicated at the Capital Markets Day, we expect free cash flow to remain above adjusted net income, with that difference contracting over time.  Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Sarah James from Barclays, you may go ahead. . Javier Rodriguez : Hi, Sarah. Sarah James : Thank you. Yes, hi. So I wanted to get a sense, as we go through Omicron and we think about the waves that are coming ahead, there seems to be more mild outcomes, like you mentioned today. And I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s contemplated when we think back to your Capital Markets Day, when you talked about the 160 million to 200 million in OI drag over the next four to seven years from excess mortality. If that contemplates continuing more mild COVID trends as the years go on? Javier Rodriguez : Well, I\u2019ll let Joe talk about the numbers in a second but let me just start by saying the way we\u2019re talking about it internally in the company is that we are no longer going to speculate to how this is going to behave because we have been so surprised over time. We all had such hope when the vaccines came out and then when the boosters came out. And of course, it has resulted in a milder hospitalization and mortality but at the end of the day, I think we can all now accept that no one can speculate where this is going. Our hope is that it does become less impactful in our business and eventually, it\u2019s something that we can deal with in the normal course of business, but that would not be a prudent thing to assume. So why don\u2019t you go ahead, Joel, and talk about what we\u2019ve built into the number. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Sarah. So as I think about how COVID impact will play out going forward relative to a wave like Omicron or a wave like Delta, there are a whole bunch of impacts that COVID has across the P&L. And what we\u2019ve said and remains to be true that there are a lot of offsets in everything, except the excess mortality and the net impact that we expect from COVID will largely be the net impact of excess mortality. What you see with Omicron is, while, yes, it is it is a milder disease, because it was so much more transmissible, that it\u2019s still led to a big wave of excess mortality. We saw that in Q4. We\u2019re continuing to see that in Q1. So as I think about different variants and how they might play out going forward, I think net-net the question is what\u2019s the impact on excess mortality. Sarah James : And can you update us on in your conversations with payers, if -- when you\u2019re talking about future rates you\u2019re building in inflationary factors for wages. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be for \u201824 contracts now. Javier Rodriguez : Well, those conversations are playing out in real time. But the reality is that as you know and we\u2019ve talked about for some time, our contracts tend to be longer term in nature. And so the bulk of our contracts are not up for renegotiation. So we\u2019ll have to, of course, assess how inflation behaves over time when each and every one of those contracts comes up. And so right now, there, let\u2019s call it in, and what was negotiated previous to seeing this ramp up in inflation. Sarah James : Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And our next caller is Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Javier Rodriguez : Hey, Justin. Justin Lake : Thanks, guys. Hey. So wanted to go through a few things in detail. First, Joel, you talked about the first quarter being similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the mortality headwind, from an OI perspective. Can you walk us through again, and I might have this somewhere but the OI headwind by quarter, first quarter through fourth quarter in 2001. Joel Ackerman : The OI headwind by quarter, I\u2019m going to do this off the top of my head, it was in the 30s each of the first two quarters, so mid 30s, 55 in Q3, and then 80 in Q4. And I\u2019m getting thumbs up in the room, so I got it, right. Justin Lake : Okay. So 80 is the number for Q1. Joel Ackerman : No, no, Justin, let me clarify before before you go. What I said in the script was that the excess mortality in Q1 was going to be at least as large as what we saw in Q4, so that\u2019s about the mortality. Remember, in terms of COVID impact, excess mortality has a cumulative effect. So adding another 1100 deaths or more, you would add that to what we\u2019re seeing in the quarter. There are other dynamics, of course, but when you just focus on the excess mortality, which is the dominant dynamic, you\u2019d expect that number to go up a bit. Justin Lake : Got it. So 50 to 80 might be 80 to 110, something like that, giving it similar trajectory incrementally. Is that a way to think about it? Joel Ackerman : That sounds a bit high and I think that\u2019s really a function of two things. There were a significant number of missed treatments in Q4, which has it -- is a temporary negative impact of COVID. That would -- we would expect that to go down. And second, there were some non-recurring labor components to the COVID impact in Q4 as well. Justin Lake : Got it. Is there a -- I apologize if you\u2019ve said this, but is there a number like 200 in 2021, is there a number that you gave for 2022, you think that\u2019s embedded in guidance? Joel Ackerman : It\u2019s embedded in guidance. I think, as we think about COVID impact, we\u2019ve spent the last seven quarters calling it out on a cumulative basis. As we get further and further away from the beginning of COVID, it gets harder and harder to estimate what the cumulative impact is. The baseline is -- we\u2019re so far removed from the baseline that it\u2019s hard to talk about the cumulative impact. So we\u2019re thinking about what -- the COVID that\u2019s baked into the numbers as effectively the new normal from which we\u2019re going to go forward. We\u2019ll continue to talk about the impact we see quarter-over-quarter, but I think we\u2019re going to move away from talking about it as a cumulative number. Justin Lake : Okay. And then you talked about Medicare Advantage penetration being an offset here. Can you tell us what that was at year end and where you are kind of after open enrollment? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, at the end of the year, which is the most recent number I have, Justin, we were at 42.3% on MA. And I think that\u2019s the latest one we want to show you. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, if we think about it for the year, I would say we would expect growth to continue to be strong but not as strong as we saw in 2001. Justin Lake : Okay, great. And then last question just on the dialysate issue. Can you tell us -- you talked about that and I know there\u2019s been some discussion of this in the industry [indiscernible] apparently has an issue. Can you confirm that like, where the issue is, is coming from? And you said, it\u2019ll continue to at least the second quarter or you think for the second quarter, is there any visibility on this improving? Javier Rodriguez : Well, yes, the community -- this is a national issue for all providers, so there has been a shortage in supply. You can trace it back, of course, to the chain supply issues across the country, and the distribution centers and the labor issues. So it\u2019s a cumulative of all of them. So there was labor, transportation, everything, all came together, as it has happened in so many of the places. What we did as a community is, of course, the first thing is get the clinical leadership to make sure that we were doing safe dialysis, then we started to basically titrate so we would use less of the product, and then we made sure that everybody understood what kind of inventory was at each location, so that we would not have anyone stack or stock inventory. So the entire community did that. The visibility that we have right now is that, again, that will play out and we will be back to normal sometime in Q2 is what we\u2019re being told and so we will continue in the state where we\u2019re all, if you will, at a much lower inventory level. That makes \u2013 did I answer your question, Justin? Justin Lake : Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll jump back into queue. Javier Rodriguez : No, no, no. If it was entirely clear as to this whole notion of why we don\u2019t want to go back to this baseline because it\u2019s so far. So just to put a finger on something that we are all experiencing is travel and entertainment, which we of course, are one quarter over another, you could say we used to have a run rate, as the world actually changed in travel and entertainment, it is going to be completely different. Then we had benefits, which we told you we had a run rate, but the benefits have changed and the run rate. So that\u2019s why it starts to get a little harder to go into that and, as Joel said, we want to go now into sort of, let\u2019s call it, the new normal and go off of that and so hopefully that made sense here. Justin Lake : Got it. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Let me take my questions here. Drilling down into the OI guidance for 2022 were down 35 million. Did I hear you right that there\u2019s an additional $50 million in labor costs versus the Analyst Day. And then you have to have the more COVID -- excess mortality than you\u2019d expected and you now assume 6000 excess mortality, that\u2019s in 2022. It seems like a lot of headwinds versus your guidance of laying down 35 million, so just wanted to understand what were the tailwinds versus your previous guidance. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, Pito, I\u2019d point to two tailwinds. One is the final Medicare fee for service rate came in at 1.9%, which was above our estimate and the second is, we got partial sequestration relief for the year, which is about $25 million. So those to offset those and you wind up with a net $35 million decline. Pito Chickering : Okay. And on the excess mortality, I understand that that\u2019s impossible to forecast at this point with like 100 for the first quarter. It\u2019s a little unclear so what the incidence rate is for new patients entering dialysis. So any chance you can give us sort of the color of how many patients you guys had at the end of third quarter? How many have at the end of fourth quarter and where that\u2019s tracking sort of at this point in the first quarter? Javier Rodriguez : I\u2019m not sure I understand your question, Pito. Pito Chickering : Yeah, so I think you\u2019ve given us the excess mortality for death for the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And I guess, on the other side of the equation that you have extend [phonetic] of new patients entering into dialysis. So just curious if you can give us sort of what -- how many patients you had to be at a third quarter? How many had the end of fourth quarters and so where that is at this point today in the first quarter? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, so the patient count is relatively flat. In terms of the underlying drivers that drive the new to dialysis admits, we really haven\u2019t seen any changes there. It continues at the pattern that we saw pre-COVID and there are really only two dynamics if you\u2019re looking at treatment count or treatment volumes or treatments per day between Q3 and the end of the year, and that\u2019s one the continued excess mortality that we talked about and the second is the dynamic of missed treatments. So that if you\u2019re asking about the pipeline of new to dialysis patients, that remains quite healthy. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then from another perspective, as you think about first quarter sequential treatment versus the fourth quarter, we already had the excess mortalities, sort of the time lag between different quarters and then the lost treatments that we had during the fourth quarter due to patients that were in the hospitals. So would we be modeling first quarter down a little bit versus fourth quarter or relative flat sequentially? Javier Rodriguez : It\u2019ll depend a lot on missed treatment rates. I\u2019d say, for the -- actually there\u2019s one other dynamic we did make an acquisition in Q4 and that was almost for 1000 patients, a little -- about 750 patients. So that that adds to the dynamic and that\u2019ll help Q1 as well. But I\u2019d say for the course of the full year, we are -- based on the COVID numbers that we built into our forecast, we\u2019re thinking of treatment volume growing somewhere between 0.5% and 1% for the year; obviously, as COVID plays out, that number could vary. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then on the IKC, I think at the Analyst Day, you guided to sort of 50 million to 75 million of incremental costs in 2022. On the script, I think you said, 50 million. I just want to see if the economic costs for IKC are -- have changed versus what you told us at the Analysts Day. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, I think that the number hasn\u2019t changed, Pito, so it is the 50 just to clarify, incremental 50. Pito Chickering : Perfect. And then, so, one more question on -- for IKC. Looking at the class of patients that you guys enrolled into the first quarter of 2021, in terms of how those losses were in the first quarter when you first got them versus the end of the fourth quarter of 2021? Any clarity on sort of how that class of patients sort of how this loss has progressed throughout the year? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, not yet, Pito. Remember, in the first year, we generally drive no revenue. So it\u2019ll really be sometime in 2022 where we\u2019ll start to get see that playing through in the financials. Pito Chickering : Okay and then two more super quick ones here. What were your home treatments at the end of the fourth quarter? How should that progress through 2022? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, the home penetration rate was in the low 15% range. Home grew about 3% in the year versus in center, which shrunk 2%. So our continued path to grow home and be a leader in that modality continues strong. We\u2019re not guiding specifically on that number for next year. Pito Chickering : And then to Justin\u2019s question on the dialysate supply shortage, is there any inflationary cost pressures, if you have to hit a spot market to get the dialysate required or are those under those contracts? Thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Yeah, thanks, Pito. On the dialysate, in particular, it is contracted, so no is the answer to that one. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America, you may go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great, thanks. I guess not 100% clear to me what you guys are signaling about the 2023 outlook. I know so far out, but you gave us some comments last quarter about what 2023 would look like. And it seems like some of the headwinds here might persist into 2023 as far as maybe higher labor costs or mortality being a little bit higher from a starting point perspective, but some of the tailwind like sequestration delay would not. But at the same time, you\u2019re also kind of saying your growth rate of 2021 hasn\u2019t changed. In fact, 2021 is a little higher, which would point to a little bit higher 2023 number. I\u2019m just trying to think directionally, how should we think about 2023 versus your prior comments? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, so I would say the following. First, you\u2019re pointing out that labor and COVID remain big uncertainties through 2022 and potentially 2023 is spot on. That said, the uptick that we\u2019ve talked about in 2023, at Capital Markets Day, remains to be something -- remained something that we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in. And if I had to bucket them, I\u2019d say the easier things that we can anticipate driving in \u201823 over \u201822, one would be the ballot initiative going away, right, we don\u2019t have those in odd years; second would be IKC will start seeing revenue in 2023 from the big cohort of patients that are being added in 2022; third are a number of cost initiatives that we have that we are implementing across the P&L. So those are the, I\u2019d say, ones that we\u2019ve got a lot of visibility on.  The one we have less visibility on is the COVID unwind. We continue to believe that as COVID moves into the background in the future that will be a tailwind for us. It\u2019ll be a tailwind for us uncertain cost items but most importantly, it\u2019ll be a tailwind for us on patient growth. So our views on those have not changed and if I had to put a number on those, I think you could add those up and easily get to a $200 million opportunity that we\u2019re going after and that would be over and above the normal growth we would expect in a typical year. Kevin Fischbeck : But your current outlook for COVID mortality feels a little bit higher. So I would think that would kind of maybe delay kind of that re-utilization of that 200 million, which might make how much you recapture in 2023 less than what you would have thought few months ago? Javier Rodriguez : Well, it will depend on the timing and we don\u2019t profess to have a crystal ball about COVID. We wanted to be crystal clear about what we built into our forecast and obviously, it could be better, it could be worse. Depending on how the timing plays out in 2022, there are different scenarios about what this number could look like in 2023. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Now, that\u2019s fair enough. And then, I guess in the quarter, it looks like you closed 30 centers, which I think is like, as many as you\u2019ve ever closed in a year, like for last decade plus that I\u2019ve been covering DaVita. So wanted to understand what was driving those closures in Q4? I guess the year number is twice what you ever done in the year before. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, thanks for the question. It is a little higher than normal, although we always have some center closures and consolidations, etc. I think the best way to think of footprint is we have three lenses. The very first one is of course, access to patients, ensure that patients are safe and have the right access. The second lens would be what is the mix of home and in-center and how that changes over time. The third is utilization, which is we\u2019ve had, of course, because of this excess mortality, we\u2019ve had some utilization decrease. And then the last is sort of you think of the local market dynamics. And so we want to be really careful and want to be very thoughtful that if you were going to say what\u2019s the net takeaway is that we continue to think that we will build less to de novos and more home centers over time. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. But I guess I mean, if the shift -- if you\u2019re talking about recapturing the COVID headwind then your low volume this year, I would say that those sites just don\u2019t stay open because they\u2019re going to recapture that line over. Is it really more that shift to home is the biggest driver to that or is it [Multiple Speakers]. Javier Rodriguez : If you look at our utilization over time, we actually started to grow less pre-COVID than we had COVID. So the compounding of that actually has our footprint having less utilization than we\u2019ve had historically. And so we\u2019re just -- and then you add the dynamic of home growing and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We just want to make sure that we have the right modality in the right market and so we continue to assess that at every market. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then just maybe the last question, the higher labor costs that you\u2019re building in now versus the previous guidance, are these underlying wage increases that kind of increase the base going forward or is there some component of that? I think last time you talked about increased training and things like that. Is there some of that that would go away or is this 50 million kind of added to the base going forward? Joel Ackerman : Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. We were just talking about that because, of course, there has been a bit more turnover and we\u2019re working on how to get training to be a bit more efficient and effective, but the bulk of the number will stick with us. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Gary Taylor from Cowen, you may go ahead, sir. Gary Taylor : Hey, good evening. Couple of small questions and then a larger one, the comment about the increase in commercial mix sequentially that\u2019s playing out, is that still just the mortality impact the primary driver there? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. And the consistent thing that the patients are really valuing choice of keeping the commercial insurance. It has really demonstrated through the pandemic resilience in value of the patient wanting to keep their insurance, and then the excess mortality coming, as you said, from a bigger number of Medicare patients. Gary Taylor : And then the mention in the release about part of the revenue sequential growth was flu vaccine. I know that\u2019s a seasonal thing for you guys. Is that -- how material is that? And is there any larger pickup in that this year that\u2019s material in any way, just given that [Multiple Speakers] awareness? Yep. Javier Rodriguez : Oh, sorry. I thought you were done, Gary. The number is immaterial and it\u2019s actually offset on the cost line items. So it\u2019s basically a service that we offer to our patients because it\u2019s good and convenient for them, as opposed to thinking of it as an economic one. Gary Taylor : Yeah. Last question. I just want to get your view. I haven\u2019t heard you guys talk about the Supreme Court case on ERISA plans that have made changes to dialysis payments and benefits structure. I think the oral arguments are coming up on March 1 and presumably a ruling this summer. I think I understand your view would be that it\u2019s discriminatory practices and I guess that\u2019s what the courts going to decide. But what do you think the implications are if the Sixth Circuit is overturned and the Ninth Circuit sort of upheld and it gives ERISA plan some leeway [phonetic], I guess, to pursue cost containment strategies for lack of a better word? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, thanks for the question. And I worry, it\u2019s a complicated one if people haven\u2019t been tracking the details. So I\u2019ll probably just let me pull up a little and explain the case. And so at the heart of it -- of the issue is Medicare in the Secondary Payer Act, commonly referred to as MSPA, protect patients from direct and indirect discrimination. So that\u2019s really kind of the question. And so more narrowly, is there a distinction between dialysis patient or what\u2019s in the statute, which is ESRD patients. And so that might sound like wordsmithing but it\u2019s really at the heart of it.  And so you say, how did we get here? Could you explain how we got here? And it\u2019s basically as you know, there\u2019s a small employer groups guided by third-party benefit design that limited benefit of dialysis patient, and in essence, de facto push them to Medicare. And then that went into certain courts and then as you said, the Sixth and the Ninth Circuit split ruling, and then Supreme Court said they wanted to take it up. We won\u2019t speculate on the ruling but you\u2019re basically asking, okay, what happens if you do lose, of course, I put -- get my energy from winning. But if you ask me what happens if we do lose? There are several scenarios, as you know, the Supreme Court is highly nuanced and so it could be a narrow law, which may not have any impact, and they might provide a lot of clarity. And then you might say, okay, well, what happens if it\u2019s a broader loss? The first thing is, you probably want to quantify it, and I don\u2019t think I can help you there because it is impossible to forecast what they would plan do and how would they consider it in the light of their reputation risk, and in the fact that there\u2019s all kinds of legal requirements under the ADA now. And in addition, we have discrimination provision in the ACA. And so it might be that we\u2019re arguing one pillar, but the other two pillars are so strong that actually has no impact but we don\u2019t know. We will continue to advocate hard and if we lose, we will continue to seek clarity in a legislative way. But the most important thing for us is that our patients are protected, so that they have the right to get care just like in any other disease and so we are going to be really, really focused on it and be aggressive, both legally and legislatively, because we believe that our patients deserve it. So I shut a lot, so let me -- because it\u2019s such an important thing, so any follow up questions? Gary Taylor : No, I think -- I mean, obviously, investors want -- are trying to think about how to quantify the possibility of a loss, and I\u2019m struggling with that, as well and tend to agree, it\u2019d a big step to think a lot of plans would significantly change behavior. So I think for now, I just appreciate what you\u2019ve laid out there. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Gary Taylor : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Lisa Clive from Bernstein, you may go ahead. Lisa Clive : Hi, there. Two questions. Just number one, could you give us the percentage of your patients -- of your Medicare eligible patients that are in MA now? I think the last number you gave us was around 41% around your Q3 results. And then number two, just on the labor costs, is it wage inflation mainly or is it also sort of staffing shortages or if you could just give us an idea of how that splits out? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, so quickly, on the MA, it\u2019s a little north of 42% of our total Medicare patients are on MA. On the labor side, it\u2019s generally wage inflation that we\u2019re talking about. Lisa Clive : Okay. So you don\u2019t have a lot of vacancies or needing to use agency staff, that sort of thing? Javier Rodriguez : No, we do but we\u2019re pretty good at that being kind of short term. So I think we\u2019re answering to be as helpful as possible, as you\u2019re saying, is this a good stepping stone to go into the future and the fact is that that it is, even though we\u2019re struggling. One of the things that we do and when we have labor shortages is sometimes leadership, which is fixed salary, we\u2019ll step into the floor, because we have a lot of our facility administrators that are nurses. That\u2019s not something we want to do for a long period of time, it\u2019s unsustainable, but that\u2019s very helpful when you\u2019re short staffed. So there\u2019s a lot of dynamics, as you know, and interplay when you\u2019re looking at staffing, but I think if you were going to say what\u2019s the bulk of that number, it is inflationary in the wages. Lisa Clive : Okay, great. And one last question just on home dialysis, how has the growth rate changed, if at all, over the last year or two? I guess, there may be more interest in it but are you also having more sort of bottlenecks around being able to train patients because of stretched staff that would be helpful to understand how that\u2019s going? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, I think COVID, of course, creates some air pockets as it relates to growth and we\u2019ve talked a lot about during the call, excess mortality. So if you were going to step back and look at the mix overall, in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve basically gone from a little over 12% to 15% of our patients being in some kind of a home modality. So the modality was driving double-digit growth for quite some time and then COVID occurs. And so what happened during the year, we were between 2% and 3% growth during the year but then again, our in-center shrunk. And so the modality is still thriving, people are still picking it, we continue to create the best home suite out there, surrounding patients with all kinds of things so that they can get on to the modality. As it relates to training, of course, COVID has added some challenges and then also COVID has had some tailwind in the sense that people say, gosh, if this happens again, maybe I want to dialyze at home. Still it is not an easy answer but hopefully those trends give you a sense of the appetite for the modality. Lisa Clive : Great, thanks very much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead sir. Pito Chickering : Hey there, guys. Thanks for taking my last follow up here. Just a really quick question here and I understand it\u2019s impossible to model excess COVID mortality from COVID just because basically it is impossible to predict. But could you give us some sensitivities around operating income impact, if excess mortality is 3000 versus 6000, you guys are assuming? Javier Rodriguez : I think the rough math on that would be about a $30 million delta. Pito Chickering : So basically \u2013 Javier Rodriguez : And that\u2019s for the year and that uses a mid-year convention. Pito Chickering : Yep. So to assess [phonetic] that differently, if you guys hadn\u2019t taken your excess COVID mortality of up to 6000 that probably would have been almost a delta between the guidance you provided at the Analyst Day versus today. Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, I think that math works, Pito. Pito Chickering : Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I\u2019m showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : All right. Well, thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for your interest in our company. As you can see, like many other companies, the short term is a tough one with the macro landscape being quite complex and dynamic, in particular, in the labor markets. That said, hopefully, you hear from our voices that in the long term, we continue to build a differentiated capability and then we are very positive on how we are positioned to deliver integrated care for our patients, deliver world-class outcomes, and bring savings to our payers. I would be just remiss if I don\u2019t finish by saying that this is all possible because the resilience, the passion, and the dedication of that DaVita team that wakes up every single day to deliver life sustaining therapy. So thank you for your time and we\u2019ll talk again next quarter. Be well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the DaVita First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ackerman, you may begin your conference. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I\u2019m Joel Ackerman, CFO and Treasurer. And joining me today is Javier Rodriguez, our CEO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we\u2019d like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Joel, and thank you all for joining the call today. It is an interesting time right now as our country and our world are facing a unique portfolio of onetime events, all happening at the same time. On the positive side, we\u2019re gathering and interacting more as communities and society as COVID infection rates have declined. On the more challenging side, we\u2019re dealing with new economic pressures of inflation, supply channel constraints and the sad consequences from the war between Russia and Ukraine. As our organization works through these challenges, I think it is critical to keep in mind why DaVita exists. We are a patient-focused organization that provides life-sustaining care to over 240,000 people in 12 countries, which is why I want to start the call by sharing clinical highlights. As you know, one of our key focus areas has been improving a patient\u2019s experience in dealing with their kidney disease, and one way to do this is through focused efforts to reduce the amount of time that our patients spend in the hospital. With our new integrated care partnerships, we have been scaling our models of care and are seeing early results of double-digit percentage reduction in time spent in the hospital, which is absolutely great for our patients and for the health care system. These results are in line with our expectations. The improvement is primarily driven by our care management, our clinical interventions and our focus on the quality of care of our patients. Pure hospitalization translates into better quality of life for our patients and more healthy days at home doing the things that they like with the people they love. We are optimistic about these early results, and we\u2019ll continue to find ways to improve our patients\u2019 quality of life. Now let me transition to our first quarter performance. In Q1, we delivered operating income of $338 million and earnings per share of $1.61. Operating income was down sequentially, primarily due to typical seasonal factors, continued volume pressures from COVID and higher wage expenses. The mortality rate of Omicron variant of COVID has been significantly lower than prior variants, but the sheer magnitude of cases resulted in estimated excess patient mortality of approximately 2,100 in the first quarter. Therefore, our treatment volumes declined compared to the prior quarter. The good news is that patient infections and mortality rates have declined over the last couple of months, consistent with national trends, and we have not yet seen significant impact from new subvariants. Therefore, we\u2019re beginning to see positive trends in treatment volumes in both March and April. On staffing, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we continue to experience a challenging labor market. Year-over-year, our first quarter field labor expense increased over 6%. The increase is due to a mix of higher-than-normal merit increases, higher incentive pay, increased utilization of contract labor and lower productivity due primarily due to higher training costs and inefficient staffing associated with cohorting COVID patients. While we\u2019re seeing some positive trends in our ability to fill open roles in our clinics, we expect to experience higher-than-normal, year-over-year labor cost increases for all of 2022. With all of these challenges, we believe it\u2019s more likely that our performance will fall within the bottom half of our guidance range for 2022. However, there are scenarios in which our results could be above or below this due to the uncertainty of the environmental impact of labor, costs and COVID. Looking forward to 2023 and beyond, we\u2019re preparing for wage rate growth to continue above average historical levels. To offset this impact, we will need to demonstrate continuous cost innovation. We have already identified a number of cost savings opportunities to help mitigate these inflationary pressures. These include savings from a new ESA contract, G&A efficiencies, capacity utilization improvement, clinical operation optimization and procurement improvements. We expect to start realizing these savings in 2023 with a full run rate benefit in 2025. We believe that these anticipated savings, combined with an expectation of higher rate increases from government and private payers in the future, can keep us on a path to deliver on our long-term adjusted operating income growth of 3% to 7% and an adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 14%. I will wrap up my prepared remarks with some thoughts on our Integrated Kidney Care or IKC business. As we shared in our Capital Markets Day, we continue to see significant potential for our IKC business. First, delegated patient volumes are strong and consistent with our initial modeling with some potential upside over the next 12 months. We are on track with our expected ESKD member growth via new payer partnerships, and we are trending ahead of plan on new CKD payer partnerships as payers recognize our ability to effectively collaborate with physicians on managing this patient population. Second, available cost savings may be higher than initially forecasted given strong nephrologist engagement and from the recent release 2023 MA rate increase of approximately 10%. Third, we have expanded the number of nephrologists with whom we are working with in value-based care. We are now engaged in a new value-based partnership with over 1,800 nephrologists around the country with more than 600 nephrologists using an integrated CKD electronic health record. Last, we continue to have confidence in our clinical model, which is now beginning to operate at scale. With that, I will turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. First, let me start with some additional details on our first quarter results. The biggest driver of the operating income decline of approximately $50 million from Q4 was seasonal factors. First, there were 2 fewer treatment days, resulting in approximately 185,000 fewer treatments in Q1. Second, there is negative seasonal impact on revenue from higher patient coinsurance and deductibles. Third, payroll tax expenses are higher in Q1. Now moving on to the underlying drivers of operating income. U.S. dialysis treatments per day were down approximately 2,000 or 2.2% in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 2021, primarily due to excess mortality from COVID in late Q4 and in Q1. Higher mistreatment rates in Q1 from the Omicron surge added to the negative impact on treatments. Revenue per treatment was down quarter-over-quarter by approximately $0.35, primarily due to the impact of higher seasonal coinsurance and deductibles, largely offset by increases in the Medicare fee-for-service rate for 2022 and continued improvement in both MA and commercial mix. Patient care cost per treatment was up $4.49 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher wage rates and the impact of lower treatment volume on fixed expenses in our centers. G&A expenses were down approximately $26 million quarter-over-quarter, largely due to the seasonality of our G&A spend. Our Q1 operating loss for the IKC business was in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in growth. We remain on track for the incremental $50 million investment in our IKC business for the year. In Q1, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our stock, and we\u2019ve repurchased to date an additional 800,000 shares since the quarter end. Looking forward to the rest of 2022, in Q2, we anticipate a rebound in operating income as the Q1 seasonal factors fall away, partially offset by the reduction and then the full elimination in Q3 and Q4 of sequestration relief. In Q3, we expect to incur the vast majority of the impact from ballot costs. Finally, Q4 will increase sequentially with significantly fewer ballot-related costs. Now on to our views for 2023. As we shared at our Capital Markets Day, we consider 2022 to be a transition year. We expect to see a rebound in our operating income in 2023, driven by growth in the core business, a reversal of some of the COVID headwinds, no contribution to the industry\u2019s fight against ballot initiatives in California and progress in our IKC business. At our Capital Markets Day, we sized this operating income rebound from \u201822 to \u201823 between $250 million and $400 million. Our updated view on 2023 revolves around 3 of the underlying drivers. First, we are anticipating continued cost pressures in wages and from inflation that were not incorporated in our prior guidance. The magnitude of these pressures will largely depend on how the labor environment unfolds over the next few quarters. We are preparing for another year of wage pressure in 2023 that runs a couple of percent above our historic levels of growth, although not as challenging as what we\u2019re experiencing this year. We expect some offset to these cost increases from higher RPT increases from Medicare fee-for-service and other payers, although our expectation is that most of our commercial and MA book will take longer to catch up because of our multiyear contracts. Second, as Javier mentioned, we\u2019ve identified a number of cost-saving opportunities that we expect will begin to materialize in 2023. While we don\u2019t anticipate any significant CapEx associated with these projects, we may incur some onetime expenses associated with some of these efforts in 2022, 2023 and potentially into 2024. We have excluded these nonrecurring expenses from our guidance. Finally, on COVID. Our inability to predict the course of the pandemic remains a source of significant variability in our forecast. Our views of 2023 at Capital Markets Day assumed a scenario in which excess mortality from COVID would be negligible, and we would experience accelerated growth beginning in 2023. As Javier mentioned, although we have seen improvements in treatment volumes recently, we remain cautious about future surges. If we continue to see surges this year and if COVID mortalities continue if the disease remains endemic, the impact of COVID on our forecast could slip from a tailwind to a headwind in 2023. Putting this all together, while it\u2019s still early to give full guidance for 2023, particularly given the dynamic environment, we currently believe that if COVID largely subsides as a source of increased mortality this year, we feel good about the range of $250 million to $400 million OI increase versus 2022. If COVID remains a headwind this year and into 2023 we\u2019d still expect a strong rebound but are not in a position to quantify it given the uncertainty. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. I guess when it comes to Q1, you missed the consensus estimates by a decent amount. But you\u2019re kind of reaffirming the guidance at the low end of the guidance, which kind of implies that the rest of the year is going to play out the way you thought, even though it sounds like these cost initiatives won\u2019t help until next year. Just trying to figure out why the pressure in Q1 isn\u2019t going to hurt the back half of the year the same way it hurt Q1. Joel Ackerman : Yes, Kevin. So Q1 was really dominated by 2 seasonal impacts that totaled about $60 million of pressure on OI. One relates to treatment days. There were 2 fewer treatment days during the quarter. And the second -- and that\u2019s about half the impact. And the second one is about the seasonal patterns related to coinsurance and deductible, and that\u2019s worth about another $30 million. So if you back those things out, there are a bunch of other things that played through in the quarter that will kind of be puts and takes for the rest of the year. But you back out that seasonality, and I think that explains most of the delta. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess maybe the way to ask the question is, did Q1 come in the way that you thought it would? Because those 2 are seasonal things that you would have known. Is it just the Street didn\u2019t model those things correctly? Is that what you\u2019re saying? Or... Joel Ackerman : I\u2019d say that\u2019s the bigger piece, but Q1 was behind where we expected, and it was mostly around volume. Mortality was higher than we expected. And while we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not changing our view on mortality for the full year, it came in earlier than expected, and the mistreatment rate was higher than expected. Q1 is typically a higher mistreatment rate quarter because of flu seasonality, but it was even higher than we would have thought, and that\u2019s largely due to COVID. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess to the point about the rate opportunity over the next few years to offset these costs, how is the commercial environment? I mean you guys have talked about relatively low net rate updates historically, and so that leaves me wondering whether you feel like you really do have the bargaining power with commercial over time. How do you feel about that ability that when inflation is going up, you do have that power? Or should we still think about weigh or overall rate growth probably being something less than what you think cost growth will be even though it will start to catch up? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, Kevin, this is Javier. Thanks for the question. The short answer is it\u2019s too early to tell because, as we\u2019ve told you, we are comprehensively contracted, and most of our contracts are multiyear. So on any given year, you probably have only 15% to 20% or so being negotiated, and so it\u2019s a little early to tell. As it relates to your question on who\u2019s got power, the reality is, as you know, is the payers have more market share than we do in any given market, and so it\u2019s a good conversation. What we\u2019re all trying to do now is see if we can align our incentives to get more progressive contracts to save cost to the overall system. And so it\u2019s a bit early to tell. There\u2019s a lot going on in revenue, as you\u2019re well aware since you\u2019ve tracked us for a long time because you\u2019ve got, of course, mix and rate and a lot of other variables. But we continue to think that the foreseeable future at least, that the yield will continue to be in that 1% to 2% range. Kevin Fischbeck : Maybe just last question. I guess the RPT has been aided by the shift into MA. I guess where do you think we are in that shift? I guess we all have the baseball analogy. What inning are we in there? Do you expect to get similar type lifts in \u201823 or \u201824? Or are we largely getting to the steady state here? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I don\u2019t know what inning we\u2019re in, but I think the biggest jump has happened, we went from obviously being subpar in the market to being roughly at market. We continue to see our new patients selecting MA at a higher rate than Medicare, and so we think that it will just continue to be more incremental but slightly higher than the MA market overall. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Maybe we can stay on revenue per treatment for a minute. So you said that the seasonality around copays and stuff hurt you by about $30 million. That\u2019s a little over $4 a treatment. So revenue per premium would have been up sequentially about 1%. Given what Medicare rate is doing, plus MA, plus you said commercial mix got better, is there some other piece we\u2019re missing here besides that on revenue per treatment? Joel Ackerman : No, Justin, there\u2019s nothing that you\u2019re missing. I think if you look at the -- I think you called out the right things, and they roughly balance out. There are a few other little things, as there always is a little bit of variability, but there\u2019s nothing else to the story. Justin Lake : Remind me, what was Medicare rate again year-over-year? Joel Ackerman : It\u2019s in the high 1s, somewhere in the 1.7% to 1.9% range. Justin Lake : Right. So that alone would have gotten you -- my math is a little fuzzy, but it would have gotten you a little over 1% alone. Plus, you said commercial mix got better, so that would have gotten your $4 back. The commercial mix is better, you said. So can you give us that number? And then so what did commercial mix do sequentially? And what did MA penetration do sequentially? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So I think the government rate number, you\u2019re a little high on. There\u2019s some Medicare bad debt you have to take into account there. There\u2019s some mix changes within government. There\u2019s flu shots. There\u2019s -- so there\u2019s a bit of noise in there, which is, I think, preventing you from getting your numbers to tick and tie. Justin Lake : Okay. Can you tell me what Medicare Advantage and commercial mix did fourth quarter to the first quarter? Joel Ackerman : MA mix came out at just under 45% for the quarter, and commercial mix was 10.5%, just under 10.5% for the quarter. Justin Lake : And what were those numbers in 4Q? Joel Ackerman : Hold on 1 second. MA mix was 39% and commercial was 10.38%. Justin Lake : Okay. And then getting back to the sequential earnings, when you said 2Q is going to rebound... Joel Ackerman : Sorry, I gave you a bad number. Q4 on MA was 42%. Justin Lake : Okay. So then you said 2Q is going to rebound after Q1 had some -- a couple of seasonality issues. Are you seeing rebound to like fourth -- we just want to try to get consensus and models in line with what you\u2019re thinking at least. So is that going to be kind of in line with the fourth quarter? When you say rebound, is it going to be to the fourth quarter level? Is it going to be beyond that? Anything you can help us with there? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I\u2019m really reluctant to start giving quarterly guidance, so I\u2019m going to stay away from that question. Justin Lake : Okay. Then you\u2019d given us a number on wages. I think it was $100 million to $125 million that you had put incremental to typical in the OI guide. Do you want to give us an updated number there? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I think we\u2019re now thinking about the high end of the range for that. Q1 came in about 6% up year-over-year. And you can, I think, model that on a base of about $3.5 billion, and we\u2019re now looking probably somewhere just below 6%. We\u2019re now looking somewhere around 6%, maybe a smidge above that for the full year, but that would get you a number consistent with the high end of that range. Justin Lake : Okay. And then just lastly, the -- a lot of us kind of looked at the hospital rates that came out, and we\u2019re scratching our heads as to why there -- some of this labor pressure and inflation in general didn\u2019t seem to be reflected. I know you guys spend a lot of time talking to CMS. When -- your rates, I don\u2019t think have come out yet. But when do we -- when does that start to occur? Do you think that in dialysis rates, for instance, for 2023 that we\u2019re going to start seeing CMS start embedding some inflation there? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So look, I think the \u201822 number was higher than normal, and I don\u2019t know that we have a whole lot of insight more than you do about why, but I\u2019d say inflation is probably a good assumption. We\u2019re not going to see the preliminary rate for 2023 until late June, early July. Javier Rodriguez : But remember, Justin, the formula is not as straightforward as one would think, so you would think that they would grab some kind of either past experience or future experience that was literally tailored to our specific financials. That\u2019s not the case. They literally grab a basket update and do some future modeling and then they apply some kind of productivity index, and then they come out with the number. So it\u2019s labor based on hospitals, and it\u2019s 2 years old, and so there\u2019s going to be a bit of a lag is the point. Justin Lake : That\u2019s the issue. Okay. That\u2019s what I was trying to get a little smarter on, Javi. I appreciate that. So you\u2019re saying that what Medicare is building in, in terms of whatever inflationary pressure there is on wages or whatever inflation is happening on wages is coming from 2 years ago. So their \u201823 rate is based on \u201821 inflation. Javier Rodriguez : That\u2019s our understanding, Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering. Pito Chickering : Going back on the first quarter treatments, I understand the increase in mortality, [increase in] the mistreatments seasonality. Previously, you guided sort of 2022 treatments to be growing to 1% to 1.5%. I guess any changes to that assumption? And then can you sort of quantify the treatments you saw in March and April? And what should we be modeling for sequential treatment growth into 2Q? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So we are thinking the year-over-year treatment growth will be down relative to the kind of 0.5% to 1% that we had talked about in the past, and I\u2019d say somewhere closer to 0 is a better way to model it now. We did see a dramatic decline over the course of the quarter. So this is from memory, but the numbers were something north of 1,500 in January, a few hundred in February and then, I think, 150 in March. So the excess mortality number did come down significantly. If -- in terms of how to model Q2, again, a lot of uncertainty here. If historical patterns hold, you\u2019d expect to see treatment per day growth in Q2 and the next surge really come in the summer. It\u2019s not clear whether historical patterns will hold. Pito Chickering : So I mean could you give us just any range with what you guys see on your treatments or where it\u2019s tracking? I guess, in April, sequentially, is this -- should we be growing 50 basis points from 1Q to 2Q? I mean there\u2019s more treatment days, but then you also had the excess mortality if they\u2019re not in that round. So I guess just you can help quantify for us treatment growth in 2Q. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So I -- first of all, I\u2019d focus on modeling treatments per day because you\u2019ll just get a cleaner number with the number of treatment days. I think I\u2019m comfortable saying it\u2019s going to go up. It\u2019s -- I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to quantify it yet. Pito Chickering : Okay. And Justin\u2019s question on revenue per treatment. I guess there\u2019s a lot of moving parts with mix and copays, et cetera. Normally, from 1Q to 2Q, we add in sort of $5, $6 from the first quarter, I guess, around 367 for 2Q revenue per treatment. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Joel Ackerman : I think your number is right for a normal year. I would remember that we are getting about $17 million of sequestration suspense dollars in Q1. That number gets cut in half for Q2. So we\u2019ll lose, call it, $8 million or $9 million of revenue as a result of that. So that will cost us a little bit more than $1 of treatment. Pito Chickering : Okay. So sort of 366 is the right way of thinking about in 2Q? Joel Ackerman : I think that\u2019s a good starting point, yes. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then last question here. On the [IPF Group], did you guys get the true-ups from your managed care partners for 2021? Just curious if you could give us some color on sort of how this patients did in \u201821 versus your expectations. Any color on the cadence of losses of the patients you had joined you in the first quarter of \u201821 versus the fourth quarter of \u201821? I guess what sort of -- how did those losses sort of change? And then the last question is, I saw your [IKC] losses are down sequentially to $370 million in 1Q from $300 million in the fourth quarter. Just I thought that would have gone up considering you bring more patients online. So if you can sort of tie that all up for me, that would be great. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So first, on the 2021 true-ups, they\u2019ll come much later in the year. We haven\u2019t really seen much on that, so we\u2019ve got no reason to believe anything is significantly different. In terms of the IKC losses, they\u2019re down a little bit in Q1. I think we got some payments in Q4 of last year that -- but it\u2019s really mostly just normal variability. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything big to call out there. Pito Chickering : Okay. When do you get the true-ups from your managed care partners for last year? Joel Ackerman : It varies in different partners, but I would expect most of them will be in the back half of the year. Remember, there\u2019s -- you\u2019ve got to let the claims run out for quite a while until you really know what the numbers are. Pito Chickering : Got it. And then just last confirmation. Your guidance is for the low end of the range for 2022, but you\u2019re still maintaining the $240 million to $400 million. So that mean that we should be -- have our \u201823 models around 1875 for \u201823? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So I build the $250 million to $400 million off of the new number we gave you. So I mean I\u2019m just doing the math in my head. I think you\u2019re in the right ZIP code with the 1875. Operator : I\u2019m showing no other questions in queue at this time. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Thank you. Well, let me end with a couple of closing comments. Patient outcomes and improvements to the quality of life of our patients continue to energize our 65,000 professionals. Because of COVID and inflation uncertainty, the short term continues to have materially less visibility than usual, in particular as we discussed in volume and wage rates. We are deploying a lot of energy to innovate and reduce our cost structure to mitigate some of these uncertainties, and we continue to feel very confident that the investments and capabilities that we\u2019re building will position us to outperform in the years ahead. I thank you for your time and investment in DaVita. Be well. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time, and thank you for joining.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ackerman, you may begin your conference. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I\u2019m Joel Ackerman, CFO and Treasurer and joining me today is Javier Rodriguez, our CEO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our second quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we\u2019d like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Joel, and thank you for joining the call. Today I will cover five topics health equity and Supreme Court case, second quarter performance, an update on our Integrated Kidney Care or IKC business and I will conclude my remarks with our current thinking for 2023. Before we discuss business matters, let me start with a clinical topics that is critical for society. Health Equity. Given the disproportionate impact kidney disease has on patients of color, health equity is of utmost importance. Across the key dimensions of access to care, access to information and clinical outcome DaVita in the kidney care community have achieved unparalleled equity relative to the vast majority of other disease states. We have used the focus of our scale to provide consistent equitable access to care and education. Our leading clinical outcomes and protocols have reduced variability across all patient populations, regardless of race, or socioeconomic status. Our black and Hispanic patients, are at parity when it comes to dialysis adequacy, phosphorus, and calcium lab values, as well as hospitalizations and mortality. As another example of our efforts to drive health equity, our Kidney SMART program is now available in 10 languages and we're participating in a pilot to develop culturally tailored education to underrepresented and underserved patient communities. As it relates to access, dialysis services are available to most patients within 10 miles of their home. We are proud of these results, and now have set our ambitions to improve access to transplant and home dialysis. Now, moving on to SCOTUS, the ruling in the Marietta Memorial Hospital matter opened a loophole for plans to circumvent the historic protections for our patients in the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, or MSPA. We continue to believe that this narrow interpretation is not only contrary to Congress's intent when enacting these provisions, but could also result in harm to this vulnerable patient population and set health equity efforts back. We're working with the community on several initiatives to not only close this loophole but apply other anti-discrimination provisions to protect these patients right to be able to choose the insurance option that works best for them. The first step in the process is supporting legislative efforts of members of Congress who are passionate about protecting not only dialysis patient rights, but also the Medicare trust fund. We're excited last Friday, bipartisan legislation was introduced to allow Congress to do just that amended the text of the MSPA to close the loophole opened by the Marietta decision. The proposed legislation clarifies the benefit plan seeking to limit or impair benefits based on the need for renal dialysis services, like the Marietta plan would be considered a violation of the MSPA. While getting any legislation pass will be difficult in election year. We believe the restoration of the MSPA is non-controversial and we will work with the Congressional Budget Office to ensure that it will be scored as a saver, which should help with passage. The community is also working with regulators to ensure other anti-discrimination protection would apply to address the type of discrimination implemented with the Marietta Memorial Hospital employee group. The proposed revisions to the anti-discrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act that were released last week demonstrate that HHS is serious about protecting against insurance benefits designed to discriminate based on a variety of things, including disability. Should we start to see efforts by employer groups to modify benefit plans to take advantage of the workaround of the MSPA created by the Marietta decision, there could be legal actions based on these anti-discrimination provisions. Now moving on to financial results. For Q2, we delivered operating income of 433 million in earnings per share of $2.30. Operating income was up sequentially by 95 million and seasonal impacts of Q1 abetted and treatments per day increased quarter-over-quarter by approximately 1%. COVID infections and mortality in our patient population declined after the Omicron surge in Q1 through May but increased in June and again in July. The treatment rates were also down significantly from the highs in Q1, but above the seasonal norms in Q2, the impact of COVID on mortality mid-treatment, and treatment volumes remain difficult to forecast and is the biggest swing factor for our performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. Labor costs remain a challenge in Q2 with higher contracted labor utilization and base wage increases similar to what we experienced in Q1. We're managing other patient care costs and G&A to help offset the impact of wage and other inflationary increases. With all these challenges, we continued to believe it's more likely that our performance will fall within the bottom half of our guidance range of 1.525 billion to 1.675 billion for 2022. Turning to an update on our IKC business. Operating losses in our IKT business were better than expected in Q2. This was a result of timing within 2022 with our recognition of some shared savings revenue earlier in the year than anticipated. We also benefited from positive prior period development in our special need plan. For the full year, we're anticipating overall performance in IKC to be better than initially expected. Looking forward, we're gaining confidence in our model of care given the early results of our 2021 Share Saving Trust. For 2023, we're also expecting significantly higher growth in our membership and dollars under management in both [indiscernible] and [CKCD] [ph] program. As a result of the better performance in 2022 and the first-year costs associated with significant growth, we are now expecting improvement in IKC operating income in 2023 to be lower than previously expected. Last, I want to provide an update on our thinking about 2023 overall. To help our investors and analysts with these updates. I refer you to a table in the outlook section in our press release that lays out our views on the primary drivers of operating income growth from 2022 to 2023. We continue to believe that we will deliver a significant rebound next year although the challenges and uncertainties around treatment volume growth and the healthcare labor market have led us to lower the improvement range to 200 million to 300 million. Let me walk you through the updated thinking. First, back in November of 2021, we expected the volume headwinds from COVID to be over in 2023 and we're anticipating benefits from a pull forward of mortality from COVID. These factors would have resulted in a higher than normal volume growth in the middle of our range and a tailwind from volume in 2023 compared to our historical results, based on what we have learned from Omicron surge in the winter and the continued evolution of the pandemic, we now expect COVID to remain a headwind to growth in 2023. Uncertainty around treatment volume intensive growth continues to be the single largest source of variability in our year-over-year profit forecasts. Second, our confidence in the likelihood and the magnitude of the cost saving initiatives we've been working on has increased. We have plans in a way to reduce our procurement costs, or our fixed cost structure and shrink our G&A. This will result in some non-recurring expenses in 2022 and 2023 but it's expected to lower our cost structure for the long-term. Third, relative to what we knew at Capital Markets Day, we're now anticipating higher revenue per treatment growth next year. This is a result of higher rate increases and lower patient bad debt. To summarize for 2023, we still expect to deliver a meaningful [indiscernible] increase of 200 million to 300 million, but based on volume and wage pressure, we are lowering that range. I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. First, let me start with some additional details on our second quarter results. U.S. dialysis treatments were up 2.3% compared to the first quarter. This was the result of one additional treatment day and an increase of approximately 1% in treatments per day. excess mortality was down significantly from Q1 as the impact of the first Omicron surge receded. I will note this benefit appears to have reversed in June and July, as a new wave is having negative impact on volumes. Mistreatment rates declined in the quarter as a result of typical seasonal patterns but remained higher than usual in Q2 because of the new Omicron subvariants. Revenue per treatment grew quarter-over-quarter by $4.19. primarily due to normal seasonal improvements driven by patients meeting their coinsurance and deductibles, as well as the continued shift to MA plans partially offset by a seasonal decrease in acute treatment volume and the partial loss of Medicare sequestration relief in Q2. Patient care costs per treatment was lowered by $5.47 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to seasonality of health benefits, and payroll taxes and lower costs across multiple other categories. G&A was up approximately $24 million versus Q1. In Q2, there was approximately $23 million of contributions to the industry's campaign against the ballot initiative in California. This is a pull forward of expenses originally planned for Q3. Our estimates for the full year impact of the spend on the ballot initiative have not changed, although it does impact the timing between Q2 and Q3. Additionally, it was a one-time gain on the sale of some self developed properties of $22 million, which approximately offset the pull forward of the ballot initiative spend. The increase in G&A relative to Q1 was largely the result of higher compensation expense, and increased T&E. Putting this all together, to help you understand how we think about the results in Q2 as a starting point for understanding the rest of the year, I would point out a couple of things. First, the ballot initiative expense in the quarter was offset by the gain on the sale of self-developed properties. Both of these items flow through the G&A line and combined had no significant impact on the quarter. Second, results in IKC for the quarter were significantly higher than anticipated for two reasons. First, we recognized shared savings revenue of approximately $15 million that was expected in the back half of 2022. Second, we had positive prior period development of approximately $10 million. Together these resulted in approximately $25 million of benefit in the quarter that we do not anticipate recurring in the back half of 2022. In addition to these components, there were other items as there are every quarter, but these largely offset one another. The result of all this is that earnings for the quarter benefited from a net of approximately $25 million compared to what we would use as a baseline for modeling earnings for the back half of the year. For Q3, and Q4, the spending on the California budget initiative is the only significant seasonal or unusual item that we currently anticipate. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of our stock, and we have repurchased an additional 901,000 shares since the quarter end. Finally, I want to add one detail to Javier\u2019s comments about the bridge to 2023 operating income. As he said, we're bringing the range of adjusted OI increase in 2023, down to $200 million to $300 million. The initiatives we are undertaking to deliver on this range are expected to result in non-recurring expenses in 22 and 2023. These non-recurring costs are not included in our guidance. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great, thanks. A couple of questions here. So it sounds like you're saying you took up your pricing outlook for next year, I guess, is any way to think about what has changed along those lines, like how much of it is because of a better view on the Medicare rate update versus MA rates versus commercial? Joel Ackerman : Yes, Kevin, there are really three components to it. One is the Medicare rate as you referenced. The second is some operational and systems changes that we're going to make internally that we think can drive higher yield or higher cash collections, which ultimately results in a higher RPT. And the third are some benefit changes that will impact the patient component and improve our bad debt because the lower the patient component comes back related to out of pocket costs, the lower that goes, the higher we will ultimately collect. None of this is about our expectation of higher rates on commercial or MA. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And is there any negative view I guess, obviously, with this Marietta there and you just talked about, the initiatives that the industry is pursuing to fix that, but I guess, is there an expectation or any early indication around how commercial contracts are being negotiated? Javier Rodriguez : Kevin is Javier, the short answer is it's too early to tell. And so we continue to watch it. And we will let you know if we see anything. As we said last time, there's a segment that's more likely than not, which is that small employer but these things take time. And so we don't have anything new to report on it. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess, you mentioned that you've changed versus your original outlook, a bridge for '23, you have a different view about volumes, how much of that is because of mass versus what's already happened in the math of that going forward versus kind of your changed view or more conservative view about what how things might develop going forward. Joel Ackerman : I think it's more about what will happen going forward than what we've seen so far. Volume is a little bit below where we were expecting. But this is more about our expectations for excess mortality going forward, rather than what we've seen so far. Javier Rodriguez : Remember, Kevin, we talked a little about a pull forward, we call it sort of COVID unwind at one point, which is we thought that once that excess mortality unwound, that we would have a little richer growth in one year, and now we just don't have visibility. Mathematically, of course, it will happen but we don't have visibility as to when it will happen. And so that's the math that the Joel just talked. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, so the total OI number has not changed. It's just the timing is too difficult to predict. So you're just taking some of that out next year. Joel Ackerman : Well, the total OI for 2023 has changed, it has been brought down in the middle of the range by 75. So it was 250 to 400. We've moved it to 200 to 300. So 75 at the middle of the range, I think it's fair to say that 75 is fully accounted for by our change in volume expectations. There's some other puts and takes as well. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess I thought that you guys talked about, like 150 to 200 OI from the COVID normalization on the volumes over time. Is that still the right way to think about, is that number hasn't changed? Joel Ackerman : I don't think our views on normalization from COVID have changed in terms of volumes. I think we've stopped kind of thinking about what's the negative impact on OI from COVID and more recognizing where we are today is the new baseline, and how are we going to move forward from here. But the comments we've made about the pull forward, and ultimately, excess mortality, at some point needing to go away and become lower than normal, we still believe in that. Kevin Fischbeck : Excellent, thank you. Operator : And our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolf Research. You may go ahead, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks. A couple of follow ups from Kevin's question there. First, you talked about some benefit changes that are going to help reduce patient out pockets, you might give us a little more color. Joel Ackerman : Yes. This relates to changes in the way Medicare is calculating the maximum out of pocket for --and for duels in particular, that's where we see the impact, we have a very heavy dual population in our MA book and as the change in Medicare -- in maximum out of pocket changes. And these dual eligibles reach their maximum out of pocket quicker than ultimately the patient component of which as you know, we collect very little, they'll hit that earlier in the year. And the result is the -- call it the patient bad debt number goes down. Justin Lake : How is that going to impact that half of the revenue for treatment, if we're thinking about next year in dollar terms? Joel Ackerman : I'd say somewhere in the dollar and a half range. Justin Lake : Got it. And is that just effectively show profitability in terms of that falls right to the bottom-line in terms of price. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Justin Lake : Got it. And then, thinking about the mix for next year. I know it's possible to say what employers are going to do with this Marietta stuff at this point. But have you built into that range that you've updated any assumption around deteriorating payer mix? Or are you assuming that stays constant? Joel Ackerman : We're not expecting any material impact in '23 from Marietta, so no change to the mix. Justin Lake : Got it. And then just a question on salaries and benefits. So and I think that number you would put in for this year in terms of your framework of typically 2% to 3% increases? I think you added something like 75 million for this year, can you give us an update versus that target that extra 75 this year? And then what are you assuming in that number next year? By our calculation, it looks like it might be more mid-single digits assumed again next year? How much above that 2% to 3% normal are you assuming per wage pressure next year? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So Justin as a reminder, we called out a number more like 125 for this year, so call it a salary wage and benefit increase year-over-year in 22 of about 6%. And that's what we saw on the first quarter. It's what we saw in the second quarter. We're expecting that for the full year. As you look forward to next year, we're expecting the number to come down but remain well above that 2% to 3%. So somewhere roughly halfway between the 3% and the 6% number. Justin Lake : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate the comments. Operator : Your next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Going back to the IKC part, you broke the $50 million of shared savings and $10 million of prior period, can we just step back a little bit and say, what's changed sort of in 2Q versus what you're expecting at the Analyst Day and expectations? Can you remind us, what's your process for getting true ups from men's care planned at this point? And then any more details as you get this true ups about how these costs savings progressed in '21? Javier Rodriguez : Well, I'll let Joel answer some of that technical questions you asked. But one of the things that I really want to make sure that we jot down on this one is that this business is -- has a lot more ups and downs. And to look at it quarter-over-quarter, it\u2019s probably not a great way to look at it, but rather to look at it on an annual basis because of these true ups and the lumpiness and the seasonality of the flu and all the things that happen in this type of business. But that said, Joel, one chance at the technical part. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So the prior period development is on the snip business and it's no different than the kind of prior period development you'd see in a managed care plan and that's because our accounting there, we take the full revenue and the full expense through the P&L. The $15 million of shared savings, the process there obviously the year has to end, the claims have to run out to some extent, data is exchanged and reconciled and when we become confident that the shared savings numbers are clarified, that's when we will recognize that revenue. So for some of the 2021 plan years, we got that level of confidence earlier than we expected and that's what led to the $15 million of revenue in Q2 versus the back half of the year when we originally expected it. If you step back in terms of where we are versus capital market today, and I'll use specific numbers just to make it clear. So we were anticipating a loss for the year from IKC roughly $175 million. We now expect that number to come in a bit better, maybe I'd say probably a $10 million to $30 million improvement relative to where we were, part of that is prior period development, part of it is a lower cost structure as we're scaling the business, we're seeing some advantages relative to what we thought. But overall, I would emphasize it is still early in the development of this business. We are expecting ups and downs but it was a good quarter for IKC. Pito Chickering : Just digging there. One more question -- and I'll go to something else. But as you look at your -- the patients that you\u2019ve got sort of in the first quarter of 2021, I need your color and sort of where those margins are today, are these sort of profitable after 18 months kind of -- any visibility in sort of how you transition from losing money to making money on these patients? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So first, let's be clear, we're not making money, we just had positive prior period development and positive savings, there's still a huge expense base against those. So it's to some extent playing out as we expected with 2021 just the timing is a bit different in the year. Pito Chickering : Okay. I guess let me ask that in a different way, with what you're tracking today, how fast before you convert from losing money on these patients into making money? Joel Ackerman : Look at Capital Markets Day, we laid out a plan where the business should become breakeven in 2025 plus or minus as the year where we think we'll crossover anything on our views around the path to IKC profitability has changed yet. Pito Chickering : Okay. Moving to the cost side of the equation, just a follow-up [indiscernible] questions. How easy is it to hire people today? Where is the turnover today versus the net hires? So how is it progressing throughout the year, and do you see a pressure on treatment growth in the back half of the year due to lack of staff? Javier Rodriguez : I\u2019d grab that. It's hard to talk about the entire country as a unison because there's sub-markets and labor markets are a very different market-by-market. I would say that it feels that we have crossed the most difficult period that this quarter feels a lot easier than last quarter, but that was on the hardest quarter in the history of the company. So contextually speaking, it's still a difficult labor market. As it relates to the second part of your question, are there markets where we're not accepting patients? The vast majority of our clinics are accepting patients, vast majority. There are a couple of pockets, five or so markets that are the vast majority of the ones where we have pressure. And so the way to look at it is that if you're a patient, the first thing you want to do is of course, get out of the hospital. There's lots of stress around acclimating to your new life on dialysis. But that said, the most important thing is you want safety and once you get to the right staffing, then you save time away from home in the right location. Right now we have more centers than usual, where a person has to travel longer than they wish, but they are getting placed and so we're working through those dynamics and hope to revert to normal over the course of the year. Pito Chickering : Great. And three quick number questions. Where is your home penetration today? How should we think about both interests, costs in the back half of the year as well as tax rate? Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Thanks. On the home penetration we had flattish growth due to all of the COVID dynamics. So that mix is still in the 15% range and as it relates to the interest expense. Joel? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Interest expense, we expect it to go up in Q3 and Q4. There are really three dynamics there, one is just the outstanding amount on our revolver is higher than normal. Second, LIBOR continues to increase and while we are capped on most of our floating rate debt, we're not capped on all of it. And third, because our leverage level is above 3.5 we go into a different tier on our floating rate debt and we're now paying 175 above LIBOR, rather than the spread of 150 above LIBOR. You put that all together, I think, $100 million a quarter of interest expense for Q3 and Q4 is a reasonable estimate. Pito Chickering : And then, tax rate, I guess, how should we think about tax rate for the back half of the year? Joel Ackerman : Tax rate, I'd say we're not changing our guidance for the year so staying at 25 to 27. Pito Chickering : Right. Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Pito. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Sarah James with Barclays. You may go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. I was wondering if you guys have given any more thought to expansion of the KPIs to give insight into commercial mix, breaking out things like pricing versus volume, but understand some of the dynamics going on there? Javier Rodriguez : Sorry, Sarah and did you say IKC? Is that where you started? Or did you say something at the beginning? I didn't catch it. Sarah James : Yes, I was wondering if you're thinking about expanding key performance indicators, or the metrics you disclosed around commercial mix to break out pricing? So we can understand the dynamics going on a little bit better. Javier Rodriguez : I think, Sarah, we\u2019re relying on giving the commentary during the call making sure the analysts and the investors understand what's moving up and moving down. In terms of putting this in a table on the press release, that's not something we've been thinking about recently. Sarah James : Okay. Are there aspects of partnerships that you guys can explore for efficiency and thinking about companies that look at efficient dosing to help bring down costs or transportation, just anything that would help offset the headwinds in the next few years? Joel Ackerman : Yes, Sarah. We've been looking at them for quite some time, hopefully our track record, if you look compounded year-after-year, our cost structure has gone up less than a percent over time and so that takes maniacal focus and discipline and execution of some of the type of things that you've said. If you look at ESA, which has been historically our most expensive pharmaceutical, we have personalized dosing and AI algorithms of the type of that you described. Sarah James : Okay. Any sense on what scale of savings opportunity there could be over time in that area? Joel Ackerman : Well, it's embedded in the $200 million to $300 million that we cite for next year and so it's in that range right there. And if you look at that slide, we have in there is a -- the cost savings that's embedded in the pharmaceutical line there. Sarah James : Okay. Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Our next caller is Gary Taylor with Cowen. You may go ahead, sir. Gary Taylor : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Couple of numbers questions, first, just going back to last call and I missed the first couple of minutes here, so I apologize. But I thought on the first quarter, you had said towards the bottom half of the OI range this year you reiterated that range in the release, but is there any commentary around bottom half for this year, does that still hold? Joel Ackerman : Yes, Gary I think we're sticking with that. No change to where in the range we think will come in. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then, I hadn't realized before, certainly we've seen the proceeds on the self-developed properties to the cash flow statement, but I hadn't realized any accounting games were running through G&A. So I appreciate you calling that out this quarter. Has it ever been as large as this? Like when I look back on proceeds last year $56 million, in 2020, $93 million. I was just curious if there were any other material gains that ran through G&A? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So the reason it was so big this quarter is it related to one of our central business offices, so a much bigger building historically they generally related to clinics. So the numbers for individual clinics were much smaller but there -- when we were building more clinics historically, there were more of them. So yes, you would have seen numbers like this they were, I'd say reasonably consistent historically. So the reason we call this out is because it was so big and it was anomalous relative to what you've seen recently. Gary Taylor : Got it. Cash flow a little softer than we thought, DSOs is still hanging up there around 65 and I thought some of that was related to what you thought at one point or sort of a timing related issues. Any updated thoughts on DSO and if and when that could head lower? Joel Ackerman : Yes, so cash flows were hurt by cash taxes this quarter, so that was the big hit there. In terms of DSOs, we do think there's an opportunity to bring it down. That said, I would call out that the shift to MA from Medicare Fee-For-Service that we've seen over the last couple of years, will structurally increase our DSOs by a couple of days. Medicare is a very quick payer, the MA, DSOs are more typical to the DSOs you'd see in a commercial book and as we have less Medicare Fee-For-Service and more MA, it does structurally increase the DSOs. That said, I think there is an opportunity to bring it down a little bit. Gary Taylor : All right. Last one for me, can you just -- and I know you guys for obvious reasons don't talk a lot about this publicly, but just [indiscernible] contract, are we back on year-to-year on that now or is that multi-year? How do we think about if and when there's opportunity around rate on ESA? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Gary, good memory, our contract does expire at the end of this year. We have renewed a contract on the ESA front and the savings are embedded in $200 million to $300 million increase year-over-year. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks. Just a few quick follow-ups here, first on leverage, in the press release you were at 3.8 times, can you give us an update on where you see kind of your leverage targets and where you see this kind of going by year end? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So our leverage target hasn't changed at 3 to 3.5 times and I think we've always been consistent that this is a range we want to be in most of the time but not necessarily all of the time and if you go back a few years you would have seen us well above it and well below it. Where we wind up in year end and in 2023, I think will depend on a few things, share buybacks being one of them obviously earnings being another, free cash flow being a third. So we're not, we're not going to give out a number because it will depend on all those factors. But I'd say over time, we continue to believe 3 to 3.5 times is the right range for us and we plan to get back there. Justin Lake : Got it. And then in terms of share repo, the company has been extremely consistent in deploying cash back to shareholders via repo. Any thoughts on, you talked about leverage potentially being even higher? Is it possible that you buyback more shares over the next 6 to 18 months, versus just free cash flow? Would you keep that at a higher level and use some of that debt to buy back more stock? Joel Ackerman : Justin, we\u2019re staying at it, as you know it's a complicated topic but the one thing you can count on is that we're going to stay consistently focused on returning to shareholders. And then, on the margin, the question is, do you get a little more aggressive and you lever up a bit, because you think it's a good opportunity and then of course, you also have to look that the world has a little more uncertainty. There is a little more uncertainty right now and so you have to take all those trade-offs, but everything is on the table. Justin Lake : Okay. And then just lastly, in terms of leverage, I've gotten a couple of questions just because your debt is trading at a decent discount to par at the moment. Any thoughts on buying back that debt at a discount to lower leverage versus share repurchase? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I mean, we look at the relative trade-offs of -- we think of those both as to some extent opportunities to return capital to our shareholders. So we'll look at both of them, depending on where they're trading. Although I think the history is clear, we tend to lean towards share buybacks over buying back our debt. Justin Lake : Got it. And last question, just the industry was facing dialysis shortage over -- earlier in the year, haven't heard much about it recently just I know, they\u2019d expected to kind of get back to normal in the June-July timeframe so just wanted to get an update there. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thanks, Justin. The inventory levels are a little below what they normally are but we've passed the period of high anxiety and having to share et cetera. So I think the worst is behind us and we can move forward. Justin Lake : All right. Thanks again. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys just one last follow-up here, just on that the Medtronic deal that you guys announced in May, just can you go into a little more of a detail on these, the goals or the transaction sort of, so why you thought that was best use of shareholder cash. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Well, there's not much to report Pito. We're excited to partner and develop medical innovation and technologies with Medtronic. I think the only thing that we have to report is that the FTC has passed the period of Hart-Scott-Rodino and so it's a pro-competitive deal. So we anticipated it to be low scrutiny and that's how it went of course, the FTC can always come back and ask, but that was a positive thing and directionally exciting for us and its early, of course the transaction will probably close in Q1 of next year, and so not a lot more to report. Pito Chickering : Fair enough. Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I am showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : All right. Thank you, Michelle. Just got two closing thoughts. First, we've been talking for over a decade about the potential contributions of Integrated Kidney Care toward improving the quality of life of our patients and lowering total costs. Now we have a sizable population, and we are very hard at work, building systems, the capabilities needed to deliver on this potential. Second, the operating environment and macro landscape as we discussed are very tough. I am very proud of the teammate\u2019s resilience and agility to offset some of these headwinds by creating the cost savers. We appreciate your interest in our company and we'll be talking soon. See you all. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Joel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Q3 was a challenging quarter for us. While natural COVID statistics have been declining, the cumulative impact of COVID on the ESKD patient community continues to grow. Despite the economic challenges, we continue to deliver high-quality clinical care for our patients. We remain incredibly grateful for the amazing work of our frontline teammates who are unrelenting in their focus on caring for our patients. While our commitment to patients is a constant, it is particularly highlighted when a community is in need. As you know, on September 28, Hurricane Ian made landfall in Southwest Florida, subjecting the community to sustain 100-plus mile per hour wind and significant flooding. This led to many health and safety issues for the people in the area, especially people who require life-sustaining dialysis treatment. DaVita operates 230 dialysis centers in Florida with approximately 14,000 patients and 3,250 teammates. Through our comprehensive preparedness planning, I'm grateful that 100% of our patients were accounted for and all had received dialysis within days of landfall of the hurricane. We deployed water tankers, generators, fuel tankers to quickly restore operations in affected areas as well as to provide dialysis to patients from across the kidney care community. Now turning to our financial results. As I mentioned, it was a challenging quarter. For Q3, our adjusted operating income was $351 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.45. Adjusted operating income was down sequentially by $88 million from Q2 and was below our expectations for the quarter. The headwinds in volumes have persisted longer than we assumed and contract labor costs and productivity did not begin to improve in the quarter as we had expected. We are now assuming these pressures will continue longer than previously anticipated. As a result, and given the continued uncertainty from COVID and the labor market, we are lowering our guidance for the year and our outlook for 2023 as well. We are reducing our 2022 adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $1.375 billion to $1.45 billion and our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to $6.20 to $6.70 per share. For 2023, we're updating our outlook for year-over-year adjusted operating income growth to negative $50 million to positive $150 million as outlined in our press release for this quarter. As we have said in the past, volume and labor continue to be the biggest drivers of uncertainty in our results. Let me walk you through the details on what we have seen on each of these and what we're assuming going forward. Let's start with the three main drivers of volume. Census growth before excess mortality, net treatment rates and excess mortality. I will cover each of these individually. First, on census growth, excluding excess mortality, we have seen a decline in patient admissions during each COVID surge, followed by a rebound after each surge. The decline we saw earlier in the year was attributed to Omicron search which we anticipated would rebound in the second half of the year as it has in prior surges. We did not see the expected rebound in Q3 and are assuming continued pressure on admissions in Q4 and through 2023. Next, net treatment rates. As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, as a result of Ominicon search, mid-treatment rates had increased and we're having a meaningful impact on the change in our treatment volume. We anticipated these increases would return to seasonal norms after the win in search and they have not. As a result, we are now assuming these will remain elevated through the end of this year and through 2023. Finally, on excess mortality. While COVID mortality rates in 2022 are down from prior years, access mortality remains a challenge for us. We expect this to persist in Q4 and into 2023. The magnitude of the impact will depend on the size and the severity of COVID surges this winter and through the rest of 2023. Taking these three metrics together, volume remains the biggest source of uncertainty in our forecast for Q4 2022 and 2023. Moving on to labor. I will cover three drivers : wage rate, contract labor and training costs. As we've talked about in the past, we've been assuming significant wage pressure in 2022 with some offsets from lower benefit costs. Overall, we expected a headwind in 2022 of approximately $100 million to $125 million. Year-to-date, our results are consistent with this forecast. We had also seen significant pressure from contract labor costs in the first half of the year. We expect these to remain elevated in Q3, although at levels below Q2. In fact, the contract labor cost in Q3 increased relative to Q2, and we're now forecasting that, that decline will be later and slower than originally anticipated. On training, we went into Q3 with elevated costs as a result of more hires, which is consistent with increases we have seen in past during hiring peaks. Training costs accelerated in Q3 and which resulted in approximately $20 million higher costs in the quarter than expected. Because of the elevated turnover, this has not yet resulted in the magnitude of positive impact we would normally expect on contract labor or staffing level. As a result, we expect training costs to remain elevated in Q4 and early 2023. In response to these challenges, we continue to work on a number of cost-saving initiatives for 2023. First, we expect to deliver meaningful savings from our new contract from anemia management. WE will begin to transition to our new contract for Mircera in 2023. Second, we are optimizing our clinic [ph] footprint for the current operational environment, which we expect to result in higher capacity utilization and better leveraging of our clinic fixed costs, including labor costs. Finally, we have initiatives underway to reduce our G&A in several areas of the business while investing in our future. As discussed, the cumulative and continued effects of COVID and labor are the key drivers of the shift in our outlook for the balance of 2022 and through 2023. We have anticipated that volume declines from COVID and labor market pressures would impact our revenue growth and margins in 2022, so we had expected release from both dimensions in 2023. We are now assuming these challenges will persist longer than expected, which is what accounts for the change in our guidance. As we step back, we remain confident in our strategy and we are focused on responding to the current industry challenges. We're dedicated to delivering high-quality care of our patients, creating a great place to work for our teammates and sustaining our investment in the future to drive growth in integrated kidney care, have more patients treated home and increase access to transplant. I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. Let me first give a few more details on Q3 results before I turn to the rest of 2022 and 2023. As Javier mentioned, we continue to experience treatment volume pressure and higher labor costs in Q3. These challenges were partially offset by lower spend on the ballot initiative than expected and lower losses than expected on ITC in the quarter. Spend on the ballot initiative this quarter was $28 million as compared to $23 million last quarter. We recognized the benefit in IKC of approximately $8 million related to shared savings revenue that was anticipated in Q4 and we anticipate could be offset with higher ITC losses in Q4 than expected. U.S. dialysis treatments per day were down 0.4% compared to the second quarter. Approximately half the decline was the result of elevated miss treatment and half from lower census. Revenue per treatment grew quarter-over-quarter by $2.13, primarily due to favorable adjustments, increased acute treatment as well as the continued shift to MA plans, partially offset by the reinstatement of Medicare sequestration. Patient care cost per treatment was higher by $8.72 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher wage rates, training expenses for new teammates due to increased hiring and timing of teammate health benefit expenses. G&A expense was up approximately $56 million versus Q2, $46 of the $56 million is the result of three items. First, in Q2, we had a onetime gain related to some self-developed properties of $22 million. Second, in Q3, there was $11 million of expense recognized related to closure charges. This $11 million is excluded from the adjusted OI. Third, there was our $28 million contribution to the industry campaign against the ballot initiative in California, an increase of $5 million over Q2. The balance of the quarter-over-quarter change is related to higher compensation expense and typical fluctuations in G&A spend. As I've discussed on previous calls, we've identified a number of initiatives to lower our fixed cost structure and our G&A. As part of these efforts, in Q3, we recorded $40 million of expense including accelerated depreciation and the write-off of the net book value of assets related to certain centers we closed as we seek to optimize our clinic footprint. These expenses are excluded from our adjusted operating income. We anticipate additional expenses will be excluded from our adjusted operating income in our guidance for both 2022 and 2023. I also want to add some details about 2023. As Javier mentioned, we've updated our year-over-year adjusted operating income growth estimate to negative $50 million to positive $150 million. The change comes primarily in our assumptions around the continued headwind on treatment volume. We've also made small adjustments to two other drivers. First, we've changed the outlook on labor costs, primarily associated with training costs of new hires now pushed into 2023 as a result of 2022 performance and inflation. We've also lowered the range for year-over-year improvement in IKC operating income by $25 million. This is due to outperformance in 2022 rather than a change in the outlook for 2023. Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares which brought the total for 2022, thus far to approximately 8.1 million shares. Looking forward, we expect the pace of our share repurchases to slow significantly. We currently plan to focus more of our capital deployment to lowering our debt levels to get back to our target leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5 times EBITDA. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Q - Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. I\u2019 appreciate all the color on the headwinds. When I look at the guide to it implies a Q4 range of about $240 million to $320 million of OI which is a pretty material step down from recent quarters. Can you maybe help rank order the headwinds you laid out for us in terms of what's driving the sequential decline? And what are you assuming with respect to COVID and its impact on treatment and labor in Q4? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. Thanks, Andrew, for the question. So if I were to bridge Q3 to the middle of the range for Q4, First, we have the benefit of ballot. So that's in the high $28 million benefit. In terms of the headwinds rank ordering them 1 and 2 are salary wage and benefit would be number one. And that's higher training costs, wage rate increases and some benefit seasonality. Number two would be volume, which is an accumulation of the census miss. So the kind of the full quarter's worth of the lower census we experienced in Q3, plus some additional census headwind as well as a spike in the mist treatment rate. Historically, mistreatment rates are lowest in Q3 and Q4 - I'm sorry, in Q2 and Q3, they go up in Q4 and then again in Q1, partly due to weather and flu season and then also partly due to holidays. And then third would be RPT. We had some favorable variability in Q3, that will come down, and we typically see a bit of a decline in commercial mix from the middle of the year through the end of the year. So those would be the big ones. I think there's a little bit of stuff in depreciation and amortization. I think IKC will come down a bit again as well, and there is some seasonality in G&A. So that would be the bridge in terms of what we're assuming here for Q4, we're assuming continued excess mortality, we're assuming the - the mistreatment rate that we've seen being above historical norms persists. And we're assuming some of the admissions or the - the, call it, organic growth challenges that we saw in Q3, we're assuming those persist as well. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. Joel Ackerman : Andrew, let me just add a little color because of what you speak of as a magnitude. I think it's important to note that underlying all the assumptions that Joel just went through we had a philosophical change in how we look at the future. So in the past, we were building in a rebound, we were assessing the uncertainties, but we thought that they would taper out by around Q3 and well into Q4. So now we're assuming that COVID remained and the uncertainty on labor and volume stays longer. And so that really shifts the models in the dramatic way that you're trying to bridge. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Any color on how much higher the mistreatment rate is in 2022 versus historical levels? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah, it's about 100 basis points higher - so you can think of that as just a 1% headwind on our treatment volume. And just to give you a number, 1% of treatment volume is worth about $50 million of operating income. Andrew Mok : Got it. And then you mentioned contract labor costs increased sequentially, which is a somewhat surprising trend. Was that driven by higher utilization or higher rates? And were there specific markets driving that sequential increase? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Let me grab that one. The reality is there is no one market. It is spread across the country. And the reason why that variable, i.e., contract labor is behaving a little less predictable than usual is because normally you would look at your training as a leading indicator of the decrease of contract labor in the future, i.e., you're training a teammate and that person is going to hit the floor in whatever, 3, 4 months. And then you would, in essence, model your contract labor decreasing because of persistence in turnover, unfortunately, our leading indicator of training is translating to lower contract labor and therefore, we're having higher contract labor and higher training which, of course, is the double whammy that we're speaking of. Andrew Mok : Got it. It's helpful. And then you mentioned.. Joel Ackerman : Just to add on to Javier, it's more about the number of contract labors and less about rate. Andrew Mok : Okay. That's helpful. Last question for me, and I'll hop back in the queue. You mentioned that you plan switching your ESA regimen from Epogen to Mircera [ph] in 2023. Can you help us understand the pace of that transition? Joel Ackerman : Yes. We've gotten a lot of questions on that. And as you can imagine, safety is utmost importance and we want to do it at the right pace. We will be done by 2023, but of course, the doctors have to review all the protocols and make sure that it's proper for their patient population. And so we don't have a particular goal. We're just saying, please review the documents and get the proper prescription for your patients. Andrew Mok : Okay. Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks, I wanted to ask a little bit about the miss treatment dynamic, I guess, is this something that you have seen happen in the past before? What would cause people to miss treatments on a consistent basis, it seems like something that it really can't happen for any extended period of time. So has this ever happened and how long does it normally take to come back? And what are the causes in your view of why it's happening now and persisting longer? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, Kevin, thanks for the question. Miss treatments are common at certain volumes because just life happened transportation vacations, et cetera, where you missed one treatment. I think you are right in assessing that there's not what I'd call a chronic miss that you can go too long without dialysis. But when we studied the data, we found that it is consolidated, meaning roughly 15% of the patients are causing 70% of the miss treatment. And so when we started to look into that, we found that roughly half of the miss treatments are hospitalizations. And the other half is a popery of things from the patient, him or herself being ill with covet or something else, so stay in home, transportation issues, either due to staffing or other things and then scheduling scheduling either due to the patient or our center. And so there's a lot of things that go into the mistreatment -- and what we're trying to do right now is make sure that we double down on our processes to reschedule the patients, but this is where it's all connected. If you have a tight labor market and staffing is tight, sometimes it's harder to get that rescheduled - so we're working on it. And basically, we had never really talked about this treatment because it was pretty flat year-over-year. And then with the COVID sort of introduction, if you will, that number started to move, and we thought it would revert back to normal, and we're now seeing it stay elevated. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That makes sense. And then, I guess, what drove the commercial mix in the quarter. I think that was a headwind this quarter, but a tailing year-to-date. So anything going on there? Any update or thoughts on what the Marriott is impacting pricing at all? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. No. Commercial mix was flattish, and it was down. It was down in what I'd call normal material way on the commercial side. And you got to remember that mix is a numerator denominator and because of excess mortality and particularly in our older population, which is Medicare that number is moving a little unusually as well. But there's nothing to report on that. Kevin Fischbeck : About pricing is Marriott having any impact there? Javier Rodriguez : No. On pricing, I remember, our contracts are set for an extended period of time -- and so if you were going to say the negative of our long-term pricing is that, of course, they didn't incorporate the inflation that we're experiencing. If you're going to look at the positive and we've talked about this, is that we have very predictable and stable relationships with our payers. And therefore, you're not susceptible to the bumps of everyday life, you can plan with with a 3-, 4-year time horizon. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. Thank Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Yeah. Good morning, guys, Thanks for taking my questions. Going back to sort of 2Q when you reported in sort of our results beginning of August, I'm just sort of curious what changed in August and September versus what you saw through July that relate to the so dramatic miss in kind of guidance? Javier Rodriguez : Yeah. Let me grab the high level, and I think I'll be a little repetitive -- the main thing, Peter, is the philosophical change in guidance. And so if you start to think we had this rebound that we thought a lot of these numbers that were high would revert to normal. We've spoken of a couple, in particular, training and miss treatments already - and so when you grab all those numbers and you say they're going to revert to normal. And instead of that, it actually goes to an all-time high, meaning it goes the opposite way. then that starts to open up a big gap -- and then instead of assuming, well, maybe the rebound is going to happen a quarter from now, we just said, we don't have any data that would make us any smarter on on really predicting where this will change. And so we had conversations internally and we had a couple of options. We had 3 options, right? The first one is you just don't give guidance at all. because it is just too much to predict for 2023. The second is you try to predict the unpredictable. -- and really try to make an educated prediction about when COVID and labor markets regulate. And then the last one is you assume the current environment doesn't change until there's clear data. And so we used to take something closer to Option 2, which is we had assumptions of COVID in volume, and we thought they would get better at the back end of '22 and improving into 2023. And now, we're taking closer adoption 3, which is we assume these dynamics that are strange in COVID volumes and the labor markets continue until we have further data. Joel Ackerman : So Peter, let me fill in Javier's high-level view with just a little bit of quantification on the details. So if you look at our '22 guidance today versus where we were three months ago, it's down about $150 million at the center of the range. That is - the biggest component of that is volume, which is, I'd say, roughly split 50% from lower census and 50% from a higher miss treatment rate. And on the mistreatment rate, it's not that it's going up further. It's just that it's not coming down the way we had anticipated, so that's 22. Looking forward to the change on 2023, it's really much more about volume. Again, census being the biggest driver on that and miss treatment rates also not coming down with our new philosophy. And then the other big component would be labor. Tow thirds training one contract. And that's really about pushing out from the second half of this year to the first half of next year when we start seeing the benefits of some of the new hires that we're putting in place and the reduction in training costs and then ultimately, lower contract volume. So those are the numbers. Pito Chickering : Okay. On the treatment assumptions or actually on treatment, I guess, during 3Q, sort of ignoring the mistreatments for a second. If I should breakout for the three key drivers here, it's instance rate of new ESRD patients, patient mortality and excess patient mortality from COVID. I guess can you just break down what you saw this quarter in these 3 buckets? And is there a slower incidence rate, which could be leading to lower promotional mix in the quarter, back half of the year? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Let me grab those because you've got the components right. So let's just start from the top. You start with new admit. The new admits are down roughly a couple of thousand patients then you subtract transplants, which have been flattish and then you subtract mortality, which as we've discussed has been higher. And then you subtract the miss treatments, which we've already discussed, has been higher, roughly 100 basis points depending on the starting point. And so that's the entire equation. The next question, which we've been really studying is why are new admits down what is happening with the population upstream, which is sort of the natural question. Unfortunately, that leads to a dissatisfying answer, and that's because of what we've talked about all along which is there is very low visibility to the CKD population, and roughly half of the patients actually crash into dialysis. So you start getting into a lot of different data sources and data sets -- and what we've looked at isn't conclusive. And so right now, the hypothesis, one could have a good hypothesis that says there happen to be a bit more depth in that patient population. There are others that think that, that might be offset over time because the volume and the pace at which someone will progress from CKD into ESKD will be bigger post time as COVID progresses. And so right now, unfortunately, again, the upstream is the one that we have the least visibility in the other variables we've already discussed. Pito Chickering : Okay. Got it. I know you don't give revenue guidance for 2023, but after so this pretty large decrease of OI guidance. Can you help guide us to what revenue growth you assume in 2023 over 2022 with all these changes that we're making? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. So I think the best components to think about would be RPT and volume. And I think at a very high level, they will offset each other next year. So again, I don't want to get into too much specificity, but I think thinking about RPT in the maybe a little bit better range and then a volume decline, if you take everything we've said at the middle of the range would be about a 2% volume decline -- so those would offset each other and wind up at kind of flattish revenue Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. Just a quick follow-up first on the volume question. So volumes down 2% for next year is what you're assuming, guys, just to be clear? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Justin Lake : That mix treatments? Javier Rodriguez : Year-over-year, there's no mistreatment impact because what we're basically saying is it's running 100 basis points higher than normal in 2022, and we're assuming that it will continue to run at that 100 basis point higher than normal level. So it's 100 basis points relative to pre-COVID, but year-over-year, it's no change. Justin Lake : Got it. So this is 100% coming from new admits below mortality? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I mean it's a combination of new admits running below historical plus continued excess mortality -- and then I think the other important thing to recognize is as as we have excess mortality throughout the year of 2022, that has a negative impact on the full year-over-year as that -- the impact of that mortality annualizes. Justin Lake : Okay. And then you talked about the clinic closures in the third quarter. Can you tell us how many clinics are closed in the third quarter? And then how many do you expect to close for the full year this year? And any insight into how many you closed in 2023? Javier Rodriguez : Sure, Justin. For the year, there's a little timing in there. So let's give a range between 130 and 150 for the year or so. And for next year, we're forecasting between 50 and 60. And again, those could bounce around depending on timing. And so just to remind you because I think we spoke of this last time, we put through several lenses. The first is to make sure we have the right patient access. Secondly, we look for the availability of home - and then lastly, we look at sort of the local market dynamics, the lens of the leases and those type of things. But it's a complicated process that we have to be really thoughtful to make sure that we're being responsible. Joel Ackerman : Justin the number was 44. Justin Lake : Okay. Good. And then does this have any impact on patient growth as well? Or do you feel like you retain pretty close to 100% of these patients when you close the center? Javier Rodriguez : We don't retain 100%, but we retain the vast majority. So it shouldn't have much of an impact on volume. Justin Lake : Okay. And then last question before I jump back the leverage. So the - would you agree EBITDA next year somewhere in the $2 billion range ? Javier Rodriguez : I don't want to get into the specifics. But I think if you're asking about leverage, where we round up to 3.9% this quarter. it is above our target range of 3 to 3.5x. And we are -- we would like to get the leverage down over the course of next year. Obviously, what happens to EBITDA year-over-year will be an important driver of that. But to further that effort, we are certainly going to rethink how much of our free cash flow we're deploying to share buybacks and lean more heavily to debt pay down. So the revolver was down from 450 last quarter to a drag of $2.75 this quarter. And I think it's fair to say that our share buyback pace will come down over the next year and our leverage level should come down as well -- I'm sorry, our total leverage should come down as well. Justin Lake : Yes, Joe, I guess what I was trying to do is like the number you have in the press release is a little bit backward looking. -- if the EBITDA is coming in the OI coming down next year to 1.4, I'm assuming you get to like $22.1million EBITDA in total, right, with the D&A -- so that would leave you closer. I think you said in the release you were 8.8% net debt that would put you at close to 4.4% on kind of a forward look versus the backward look that you have in the release, one, is that the right number? And then two, maybe I appreciate the help and understanding debt-down over share repo. But if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of if you have $1 of free cash flow next year, maybe you could just tell us previously, it's been 100% towards share repo. Is it now 75-25 or at 4.4 times, are you doing any share repo so you get closer to 3.5%? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. So I'd start with a higher EBITDA number for next year. if you take, I think, in the middle of our range, you get somewhere a little north of $1.45 billion. I think it's 1.46% on OI, add back $700 million of depreciation and amortization, you'd get to an EBITDA number that's more in the 21% to 22% range. And then in terms of how much of the free cash flow we deploy, I would think it would be a higher percentage to debt pay down than the kind of 75%, 25%. I don't want to give a specific number, but I think we're going to cut way back on share buyback. Justin Lake : Got it. That's helpful, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys. Just a sort of a follow-up here. Looking just at the fourth quarter, implied OI, if I annualize that, it's pretty -- a lot lower than sort of the new \u201823. Just curious sort of what costs or sort of more of a onetime in nature in 4Q that we won't take as a run rate into 2023? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. So let me try and build that bridge up of Q4 annualized to the 2023 guide. I think you wind up with about a $350 million gap that we would need to bridge. And here's how I do it. First, volume will be a headwind from Q4 to the full year, call that $100 million will be a tail will be a tailwind north of $200 million. I think important to realize there, again, RPT, we think, will run stronger next year, year-over-year than historically.\\ One of the big drivers of that will be Medicare fee-for-service, where the final rule is not out we're expecting it imminently. We are anticipating that the final rule will be better than the preliminary rule. So that will help RPT and then just all the normal RPT increases, so call that north of $200 million. I would add in $150 million of cost savings, which is in the table that we called out in the press release -- and then there is a bit of negative seasonality on Q4 that's probably worth $50 million to $75 million. So if you were to add that all up, you get somewhere around 350. The one thing that wasn't on my list, I just want to highlight was labor relative to Q4 we could see 2023 as being relatively flat. Labor being flat in 2023 relative to Q4. And what you see there is higher wage rates offset by the lower training costs, which we see coming down in the back half of the year as well as contract labor coming down over time. Pito Chickering : Okay. Got it. And then I know versus the other moving parts of the small one, but on the ITC guidance for 2023. I guess what what's changing your assumptions? Is it higher utilization that you're assuming? Is it lower reimbursement you're assuming? Is it increased investments? Kind of what's driving that change for ITC for 2023? Javier Rodriguez : I'm sorry, Pito, I missed that. Could you repeat the question? I apologize. Pito Chickering : Apologies. Looking at your 2023 guidance, previously, you're guiding to specifically on the ITC, you're guiding to tailwind now is a $25 million headwind or to flat headwind. So it's a swing here in ITC guidance for next year. Just curious exactly what's driving that? Is it more utilization -- is it -- it was the key driver of the delta/ Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Sorry about that. So if I look at 23 for IKC, I think there are really 2 factors at play here on the bridging it from 22 to 23. One is 22% is coming in a lot better than we expected. So you're comping to a to a much smaller loss. The second thing is we now expect growth in 2023 again. And as we've called out in the past, IC growth is a headwind in year 1 to OI. So your - the overall result hasn't changed much. It's that 22 has gotten better and to some extent, some of the benefit we're seeing in '22 is going to get offset by the impact of growth in '23. Pito Chickering : Is that growth coming from more MA contracts converting into... Javier Rodriguez : There's a little mix of that, but the bulk of it is we are opening a lot more of the CKCC program. So we had 11 this year, and we're doing 11% more next year. There will be a little more MA, but the predictable large volume will be government. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, with all the moving parts, do you view the breakeven point for ICE getting better or worse from previous guidance? Javier Rodriguez : I would say the business is performing better than we expected. But in the short term, growth has a negative impact on NOI. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you . Our last question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS. Your line is open. Andrew Mok : Hi. First, do you have the excess mortality number in the quarter that you can give to us? And then you noted that the annualization of excess mortality is a negative for next year. When you look at the patient population, are you seeing any evidence of reduced mortality rates for the current population such that when you finish annualizing this excess impact treatment should start to accelerate? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. So excess mortality in the quarter was a little bit north of 1,000, call it, $1,100. In terms of are we seeing what we call the pull-forward effect it is very hard for us to tease out the difference between higher COVID mortality and lower mortality from pull forward. So the excess mortality number we give is effectively a blend or is a net of those two numbers. We still believe in the concept of the pull forward that some patients that our census is being positively impacted by lower mortality from the earlier excess mortality, but we're just not in a position to quantify it. So I think it is fair to think of our excess mortality as a net number of the number of patients in the quarter who died as a result of COVID, offset by a lower mortality from the prior mortality that isn't occurring this quarter. I hope that's clear. Andrew Mok : Okay. I think I understand. And then on the hurricane, you noted that you're able to get all the patients down in Florida access to dialysis throughout the hurricane impact. Can you quantify what impact that had on your P&L this quarter? And is there any lingering impact of the hurricane into the fourth quarter? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, Andrew, there was no significant impact on the P&L and again, nothing in Q4 for that. Andrew Mok : Okay. And then on the Medicare rate, I think you said you're already assuming better Medicare rates. Is that 100 basis points better? Can you give us some color on what you're assuming there? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. That's a reasonable estimate. We've looked at what other sectors have seen in the delta between their prior and their final -- so we're thinking about 3.4%, I think, is a reasonable number. Operator : Thank you. And we did have another question come through Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Can you hear me okay? Javier Rodriguez : We can hear you fine, Justin. Justin Lake : So I thought maybe we just throw in one more question on kind of cost going through 2023. And for instance, Andrew earlier brought up Micra you guys are going to be implementing that through the year. So just looking to see like, is there any potential right at the end of the tunnel as we go through the year. Freyser costs for the year. The benefit of that, you won't see it, but you'll be at a higher run rate on savings at the end of '23 than you were through was also thinking about the potential you talked about contract labor being higher than you expected and that's going to hopefully moderate through 2023. So just wondering if you could give us some numbers around that, for instance, is there -- within that cost cutting, how much is Macera in that cross-cutting number -- and how much do you think you could get out? How much will the total savings be that you could run rate in the 23%? And then maybe you could tell us what your contract labor costs are running in the third and fourth quarter. and how you expect those to run through 23, so we could think about an exit rate in three/ Javier Rodriguez : Yes. So first, I think you're thinking about things directionally correctly, that the front half of the year will be tougher than the back half of the year. And for -- I put it into 3 buckets. One is Q1 is always seasonally tough because of revenue per treatment. And that's just how we account for the nonpayment or the bad debt associated with deductibles and co-pays. Second is a combination of the savings from Mircera and some of the other initiatives building over the course of the year, combined with some of the pressures associated with contract labor and training declining over the course of the year. And then finally, IKC is a business that we have generally assumed will have a better Q4 than other quarters because of how revenue recognition works. We saw -- we're seeing less of that pattern in 2022. We've seen more of the revenue that we expected to recognize in Q4 earlier in the year. But again, I think we're anticipating a better Q4 for ITC, although that's not something you could annualize. So those are the things in terms of how to quantify some of this stuff Contract labor for Q3 is running at about 30 -- a little bit north of $30 million for the quarter. We're looking at that to come down a bit in Q4 and Q1 and then really start declining starting Q2 of next year. although we're assuming it will remain elevated relative to our historical rate, which was almost insignificant. That's contract labor. In terms of quantifying the magnitude of the cost savings. So we've called out $150 million for next year at the middle of the range. Mircera is the biggest component of that. The the realignment of the footprint is number 2 and the G&A is number three. So we're not going to give specific numbers on those things, but I think that can help you get in the right ballpark on those three numbers. Joel Ackerman : Got it. Maybe on my Setra [ph] would be would the fourth quarter run rate kind of be double what the benefit that it covers the annualized, but is it going to be something that's kind of ratable for the year, so second fourth quarter exit is going to be a lot higher? -- than the full year along It's hard to tell, Justin. This - remember, this is an operationally intensive effort. Ultimately, physicians do the prescribing not us, and it will be a question of how they're thinking about it, how long it takes them to integrate the information, how many will make the change and when. So I don't think we're ready to make a prediction on that. Justin Lake : Okay. And then last question for me is on revenue per treatment. So you talked about there were some kind of moving parts there that benefited revenue for treatment First, can you put a number around that in terms of how much dollars in revenue per treatment, you saw a benefit? Just trying to understand, one, how much that benefit is the quarter and two, was a reasonable run rate to think about going into the fourth quarter? And then lastly, maybe you could give us a number on that commercial treatment that commercial mix decline. Yes. So I think you can think of the quarter as having benefited by $2 to $3 of normal fluctuation. We see that all the time. if you want a good exit run rate, I think $365 RPT is a reasonable exit run rate for Q4 and for the full year of 2022 off of which to build your '23 number. In terms of commercial mix, it was a few basis points down for the quarter. So really not significant. I think it was 10.4% last quarter and it rounds to 10.3% this quarter, but it was pretty small. Operator : I apologize. At this time, we have no further questions. Mr. Rodriguez. I'll hand the call back to you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Aman. As you can see from all the conversation we have guidance is harder with the COVID uncertainty on volume and the labor dynamics that we have spoken of. We, of course, are working very hard to give you our best estimate and now are assuming that they will stay elevated for a period of time. Let me just close with a couple of comments. One is these are very challenging times for DaVita and they are challenging times for the broader kidney care community and all health care providers. But as I separate myself from this moment in time and I look further out, I can't help but to say, we are incredibly well positioned to differentiate and outperform given the experience of our team, the clarity of our strategy and the strength of our balance sheet. I appreciate your time today. Have a good day. Take care. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Mr. Lien, you may begin your conference. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Nicolaisen, Group Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we may make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements, except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Nick, and thank you all for joining the call today. We start 2023 with a mix of optimism and uncertainty about the year ahead and with continued conviction in our long-term capabilities and strategy. We're grateful for getting through the winter without a surge of COVID-related mortality and like a bunch of society, wondering whether the worst of the COVID pandemic is finally behind it. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in the recent months to improve that, which is within our control, while we continue to invest in our future. That said, we're cautious in our optimism today because we're still experiencing the impact on volume and labor. For today, I'll spend a few minutes on fourth quarter results and then focus on the future with a summary of our 2023 strategic priorities and then end with our 2023 outlook. Before I dive into these topics, I'll start, as I always do, with a clinical highlight. Our most impactful clinical initiatives are those that directly improve the quality of life and vitality of our patients. There are many measures serving that important purpose. And today, I'll take a moment to recognize the successful efforts to decrease infection rates amongst our vulnerable patient population. One way we measure success is by tracking bloodstream infection, and I'm proud to share that we achieved an all-time low blood stream infection rate for our patients as of the third quarter last year. This reflects a 20% improvement within the last year alone. These results represent just one of many efforts we have undertaken to reduce hospitalizations and mortality, which is a tremendous gift for our patients and their family. I will now pivot to our results. Our full year 2022 adjusted operating income came in at the top end of our revised guidance at $1.45 billion. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2022 was $6.60 and we generated $817 million of free cash flow. The primary driver of our fourth quarter performance coming in at the high end of our range was improvement in labor cost. The labor environment continues to be challenging across many dimensions with fourth quarter was certainly better than third quarter. One particular highlight, our focus on reducing contract labor produced results earlier than expected. We still expect contract labor will be higher than pre-COVID levels in 2023 by $20 million to $40 million, but that will be a significant improvement to 2022. We continue to make progress in hiring teammates during the quarter as we work to stabilize center staffing levels and increased retention. Of note, this increase in labor capacity will continue to drive higher than typical training and onboarding costs in 2023 until retention normalizes to historical levels. We continue to expect wage pressure above historical norms in 2023 but anticipate wage growth at levels below 2022. Despite early optimism for improvement in 2023, the labor markets remain highly dynamic and will remain a key swing factor in our performance. Our fourth quarter results give us increased confidence in achieving the improvements we discussed last quarter. On to volume, overall results for Q4 were in line with our guidance from last quarter. COVID infection and mortality rates in December and January were lower than in prior years, which is a welcome relief for our patients and our caregivers. Because the winter surge has historically occurred late in December, the lack of a surge did not result in material improvement in our treatment volumes in Q4 relative to our expectations, but has reduced our expectations for total access mortality in 2023 by approximately 1,000 patients as compared to our expectations in the range provided last quarter. Last quarter, we also highlighted that patient admissions and missed treatment rates is a key variable to our volume. We continue to see pressure on both of the metrics, but at the levels in line with our most recent expectations. For 2023, we continue to use a wide range of possible volume outcomes in our guidance given the uncertainty of the virus. We have shifted the range up to account for the lack of a meaningful winter surge so far but have not fully discounted the possibility of a COVID surge later in the year. Our 2023 volume guidance includes a treatment range of down 3% to flat relative to 2022. All else equal, the lack of a COVID event over the remainder of the year would move us towards the better end of our volume range. Looking forward to 2023, we kicked off the year with a robust and exciting set of priorities. We remain resolute in our commitment to pursue strategic goals that create a strong future for our patients and our company. I will highlight 5 of these priorities today, beginning with innovation. First, we're approaching a key milestone in our journey towards digital modernization. After years of development, this year, we're deploying our next-generation clinical IT platform. This new cloud-based system is designed to provide seamless access to patient records across locations, supporting integrated kidney care and enhancing data reporting and analytics. Rollout is well underway, and we expect the system will be alive in our centers across the country in 2023. This platform will provide a superior experience for our teammates and physician partners while enhancing clinical care for our patients. Second, on policy, the Kidney Care community remains active working with CMMI to enhance innovative model that improve care coordination and advanced initiatives around transplant, home and Health Equity. At the same time, we're advocating for an update to the industry bundle payment system to better reflect year-over-year cost increases. And finally, we continue working with the broader kidney community to restore benefit protection for our patients through legislative and regulatory efforts. Third, operationally, we remain committed to educating our patient and our position to increase adoption of home modalities were clinically appropriate. In support of our over 1,700 existing home programs, we are launching transitional care programs across the country to educate new dialysis patients on their modality options. We're also working toward a full integration of our technology platform to create a holistic informational ecosystem for better home patient management. Fourth, our Integrated Kidney Care business is expected to deliver another year of significant patient growth. With the benefit of increased scale, it will be an important year for us to continue building on our capabilities for IKC to achieve its purpose of driving better outcomes for our patients, better collaborations with physicians and an economic alignment with our payer partners, particularly within the growing Medicare Advantage segment. And finally, to fuel these initiatives, we're maintaining a disciplined approach with our cost structure. For example, this includes our ongoing transition on the ESA therapy and the ongoing consolidation of our facilities footprint to align capacity with treatment volumes. This discipline is particularly important in the context of Medicare fee-for-service rates, which, as you know, have not kept pace with our increasing patient care costs. As you can see, 2023 will be a dynamic year across many of these efforts, and we remain firmly focused on the key operating drivers I previously mentioned. Now shifting out to outlook. For 2023, we're initiating guidance for adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $5.45 to $6.95. This reflects our latest views on continued with moderating labor headwinds over the balance of the year persisting volume pressures offset by the positive impact of avoiding a winter surge and the benefit of the cost-saving initiatives we have previously outlined. Looking longer term, if we continue to see diminished impact from COVID and moderating the labor pressure, we would expect to return to a more normal adjusted OI growth trajectory of 3% to 7%. I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and our outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. Let me first share a few more details on Q4 performance and then I'll add some color on 2023 guidance. For Q4, we delivered $317 million of adjusted operating income and $1.11 of adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, which resulted in the full year coming in right at the top of the updated guidance range we provided last quarter. For the U.S. dialysis segment, treatments per day were down 1.3% compared to the third quarter in line with our expectations. This was the result of lower patient count due to excess mortality and a higher seasonal missed treatment rate. Adjusted patient care cost per treatment was up $1.78 sequentially. There were 3 primary drivers of this increase : seasonal flu expense, year-end benefits and lower fixed cost leverage because of the decline in treatment volume. These were offset by lower contract labor costs in the quarter. Adjusted G&A was down $24 million quarter-over-quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by the $28 million of California ballot initiative expense in Q3. Turning to our other segments. For our IKC business, operating income was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. International adjusted operating income decreased $15 million quarter-over-quarter. This is primarily driven by $7 million in foreign exchange headwinds and an expense related to acquisitions in Brazil. This acquisition expense has an offsetting decrease in taxes so there's no net impact on the P&L. During Q4, we did not repurchase any shares. As we communicated on the Q3 call, our primary deployment of the excess capital will be to pay down debt to return to our target leverage ratio of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA. Turning to 2023. Let me add some more detail on our guidance. Our 2023 adjusted operating income guidance is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Compared to our comments on the Q3 call about our expectations for 2023, the only significant update to our expectations is higher treatment volume due to the lack of a winter COVID surge. To give some more color, let me run through our latest expectations on the 3 drivers of the U.S. dialysis business in 2023. First, we expect the year-over-year change in treatment volume to be between 0 and negative 3% due primarily to the annualization of excess mortality in 2022 and continued excess mortality through 2023. Second, we anticipate revenue per treatment will increase approximately 2% to 2.5% year-over-year, driven roughly 2/3 by rate increases and 1/3 by higher Medicare Advantage and commercial mix. And third, we expect patient care cost per treatment to increase approximately 2% to 2.5% driven by wage rate growth and inflationary pressures, partially offset by savings from our new anemia contract and other cost-saving initiatives. A few additional things to help your thinking about 2023, each of which is incorporated in our guidance. Year-over-year adjusted operating income is benefited by approximately $50 million due to the absence of the ballot initiative spend in 2023. Regarding timing of adjusted operating income in 2023, we expect Q1 adjusted OI to be approximately $75 million to $100 million lower than the average of Q2 to Q4 due to typical seasonal factors impacting among other things : RPT, treatment days per quarter and labor. Regarding our previously disclosed agreement with Medtronic, we anticipate the transaction will close in the first half of this year. Our initial cash investment will be approximately $300 million at closing. On the P&L, we expect approximately $60 million of pretax losses below OI in 2023, which assumes approximately $30 million in the second quarter and $15 million per quarter over the remainder of the year. The EPS impact of this will be approximately $0.47 in 2023. For IKC, we expect OI to be flat to slightly down in 2023 relative to 2022. This is driven by additional growth expenses, offset partially by increased shared savings. Our interest expense assumption for the year is $405 million to $425 million. For income tax, we anticipate an effective rate of 25% to 27%. On cash flow, we expect free cash flow from continuing operations of $650 million to $900 million. And finally, we anticipate our leverage ratio at the end of 2023 to be in the range of 3.6x to 3.9x 2023 EBITDA. That concludes our prepared comments for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first caller is Andrew Mok with UBS. Andrew Mok : To start, you delivered the high end of the revised guide this quarter, but you're leaving the OI growth for 2023 unchanged. And so can you help us understand those dynamics a bit better? Because it sounds like labor costs and volumes are both trending better, which would presumably lead to a better OI outlook for 2023? Joel Ackerman : Yes, Andrew, I'll take that one. So I'd say relative to the guidance we gave on the Q3 call, we've really learned 2 things. One is, as you highlighted, the quarter came out at the high end of our range, largely as a result of labor. And the second is we didn't have a winter surge. As we looked at guidance for the year, we incorporated the volume improvement from no winter surge. We looked at the labor dynamic and ultimately, we concluded to leave our labor guidance for 2023 unchanged, really for 2 reasons. One, we did see improvement in Q4, but some of that was improvement that we really anticipated in the front half of 2023. It just came in earlier than expected. So you wouldn't expect that to change '23. The second is we're in a really dynamic labor environment. And given all the moving pieces we ultimately concluded 1 quarter's worth of outperformance wasn't enough yet for us to change our views. So for that reason, we kept labor where it is and the improvement in the guide for next year is really the result of better volume because of no COVID surge in the winter. Andrew Mok : Got it. Do you have the number for contract labor costs in the quarter? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Contract labor costs in Q4 was down about $14 million relative to Q3. Andrew Mok : Okay. And then in the prepared remarks, you noted that you would expect to return to a more normal OI trajectory of 3% to 7% if COVID normalizes. Can you help us understand what level of visibility you have into incidence rates for new patients to drive the confidence in that restored growth rate should COVID normalize? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. I'll grab that one. In essence, when we think of growth, we think of it in 2 categories. One is what's within our control and the other is the macro factors. Within our control, as we said, in the fourth quarter, we've made some progress, and we will continue to make progress on being staffed and ready to accept new patients. On the macro, which is sort of the question that many are asking, what is upstream new patient looking like, there are some questions that we still can't quantify. Some variables that we still can't quantify. That said, there is nothing we've seen that leads us to conclude that there is a permanent change to new starts. And so the best assumption at this juncture is to assume that after COVID plays out, that admits would revert to the roughly 2% that we experienced historically. Andrew Mok : Got it. And just a follow-up. I wanted to ask about the ESA switch from EPOGEN to Mircera what sort of cadence are you expecting with respect to transitioning patients? What have you done so far? And when do you expect that transition to be complete? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. The cadence is obviously done very carefully with the coordination of all the physicians making their own independent decisions as to what's right for each patient. It will roll out throughout the year, and we should be done by the end of 2023. Operator : Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Philip Chickering : Sticking with the incidence for a few minutes. It's pretty delayed, but looking at the U.S. incident count the first half of 2022 is down sort of 5% versus '21. I guess, can you guys help quantify sort of what your new adds were sort of quarterly throughout 2022? You guys sort of assume that to be in 2023? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So our admission rate in 2022 was lower than what we've seen prior to COVID-19. We called that out. And I think that's really one of the big drivers of why what I'd call organic volume or organic growth is down. That's been persistent. It's kind of picked up through the back half of the year, and we haven't seen it come down, which is why our guide for 2023 continues basically to track what we saw in 2022. We haven't built in any material improvement to that. That said, as Javier noted, we expect that to revert back to what we saw pre-COVID once the direct and indirect impacts of COVID are done. Philip Chickering : Okay. So looking at the press release, you had added about 1,200 patients sequentially. I guess, you actually can't quantify for us the 6,000, 3,000 ads with the delta being sort of mortality. I mean, just any color just sort of you can quantify what the new ads were in the fourth quarter? Joel Ackerman : We haven't historically reported a new ads number, and I'm hesitant to give it now. I think there'll be a bunch of different ways to calculate it. So I'm not sure I have a good answer for that number. That said, look, it is -- it continues to be depressed. We saw that in Q4. There is seasonality in that number. It tends to pick up in the front half of the year. And so obviously, we're going to be looking for that in the front half of 2023. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, if you were going to use really high-level math, and I'm just trying to help get the direction going and you say, we guide it to negative 3 to 0, but I would give you a midpoint of negative 1.5. And if you just do the math of the excess mortality starting off in 2023, that's a sort of a negative 2. There's other variables going into it, but that would get you to a plus 50 basis points for new ad mets, give or take. And there's other dynamics, but that gives you direction. Philip Chickering : Okay, which actually is a segue in, I mean, I guess prior to COVID, 2018, you saw a sort of generally about a 17% sort of mortality rate gets you to just under sort of 6 years or on average. And during 2020, it was 20-plus percent mortality rates sort of sub-5 years. I guess as you're looking at the fourth quarter, are we seeing sort of mortality rates sort of go back to previous levels? There's expectation at 1 point that it would be extended. Just from a pull forward due to customer tell COVID in 2021 seeing if that number is starting to extend back again. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. So if you just look at the numbers just to make sure because there's new people to the story is in 2020, we announced like roughly 6,800-or-so excess mortality, and we're guiding roughly to 3,000 in 2023. So it is coming down quite aggressively. And I think, again, we don't have visibility exactly as to when that would revert. But as COVID unwinds, it looks like it would -- it should go with the visibility we have back to normal. Joel Ackerman : And Pito, just to add to that, to help you with your modeling, the excess mortality number in Q4 based on what we know now, and these numbers get updated as the data catches up, was roughly 900. You want to compare that to Q4 of 2021, that number was somewhere around 1,500. So Q4 over Q4, the numbers come down significantly. And we would expect similarly Q1 '23 over Q1 '22 because of the lack of the surge. Philip Chickering : Okay. One quick follow-up. Can you sort of talk about the nurse turnover. Has that sort of stabilized at this point? And then on the contract labor, what was contract labor running sort of in 2019? Just as we think about this normalizing out kind of where we are to expand your contract labor in pre-COVID? Javier Rodriguez : Pre-COVID was roughly a little below $20 million. When we got to a high, we got to roughly $100 million last year. And what we've told you is that we would run roughly $20 million to $30 million higher in 2023. So that would put you right around $50 million or so. So trying to get halfway through, if you will. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next caller is Gary Taylor with Cowen. Gary Taylor : A couple of quick questions. Going back to Integrated Kidney Care. 42,000 full risk patients. What is the guidance or what's built in for 2023? How much patient growth? Joel Ackerman : I'd say 50% is a good number to use there, Gary. Gary Taylor : So I mean 50% patient growth and then you're saying the loss is going to be fairly similar to slightly better than that 1 25, right? Joel Ackerman : I think the way to think about that rough numbers is a $50 million improvement in shared savings revenue and that's really driven by the shared savings in 2023 that we get for patients that we were at risk for in 2022, and that's offset by roughly $50 million of costs associated with that growth that we're going to see in 2023. Gary Taylor : That makes sense. And I think I understand the accounting you do for that, but the $378 million of revenue you booked this year for that segment, you've got about $3.5 billion of spend. I know that's not all ratable necessarily. But that implies like your net savings that's going into our revenue numbers, like 11% of the spend. Is that the right way to think about the results you're achieving so far? Joel Ackerman : I think it's tough to do that calculation. The $377 million of revenue in '22 really comes in 2 buckets. $300 million of it is from the SNPs, which is what I'll call gross revenue, think of it as accounting similar to a health plans accounting where the full medical cost comes through revenue. And then the other $76 million is shared savings revenue where we only book the actual shared savings amount. We don't book the full cost of the medical amount. And I think if you really wanted to look at a number, you take the, call it, the gross margin associated with that $377 million. It's not -- that's not an accounting gross margin. This is kind of a financial calculation we would do. It wouldn't comply with GAAP. And you divide that number, which is, call it, $100 million by the prior year medical spend or the dollars under management from the prior year because that shared savings revenue is associated with the prior year, and that ratio would get you what I'd call a net savings number. Gary Taylor : Got it. Following that. Appreciate it. Last one. Javier, you talked about... Joel Ackerman : Gary, I'm sorry, just a quick correction. I think you said that '23 would be flat to slightly better than '22, and I agreed with that. What I said in the prepared remarks, it would be flat to slightly worse. So I just wanted to clean that up. Gary Taylor : Okay. I just want to go to Marietta for a second, Javier, I mean, Fresenius is talking about having a lot of confidence in regulatory or legislative and you suggest that you're still active there. I guess, is there anything else you can share on where you think that relief is more likely to come, CMS making a regulatory language change or the legislation that was introduced last year. And then in the last part of it would just be any evidence at all any of the regional TPAs are doing anything with this yet? It sounds like not, given your commercial mix guide for '23, but I just want to see. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thanks for the question, Gary. Won't speculate as to how it will come or if or when it will come. But we continue to work very diligently with the kidney community and disability groups to restore our protection for our patients. As it relates to what are we seeing, we have not seen any significant uptick, but we wouldn't expect it given the time of the year we're in because there's a lag in claims and payment. So right now, it's going as expected. But one of the things that we're working with the congressional champions is that they've asked that we produce examples because they're very interested in protecting patients. So that's all we have at this juncture. Operator : And our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : This is Austin on for Justin. Appreciate the question here. Joe, I guess I wanted to start real quick just on sort of the leverage outlook in that 3.6 to 3.9 that you were speaking to. And just kind of curious what sort of needs to happen to reach both ends of that range? And then off of that on the share repo thinking, is there any timing or outlook embedded in the '23 guidance when that might resume? Or like alternatively, what do you guys kind of need to see on the debt side to start to reserve resume the repurchase activity? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So we have not built any share repurchases into our guidance for next year. We just think that's the prudent way to model things out. The range is largely driven by the range in OI, which translates into a range in EBITDA. So that's what drives the range there. In terms of what we need to see, look, we need to see a very clear path to getting back into the range before we shift our capital allocation priorities back to share repurchases. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. And then on the follow-up kind of on the clinic closures, you guys did 44 last quarter, 58 this quarter. I guess we think ahead to '23, is there kind of like a point-in-time number that you guys are kind of targeting in terms of further clinic consolidation. And then off of that, just kind of an update on how the patient retention is tracking off of that. Javier Rodriguez : We don't have a target per se. As you can imagine, it's a process that we take incredibly seriously to make sure that patients are taken care of and that the community is taken care of and we evaluate a lot of dimension. But it looks to be that the range will be in the 50 to 70 in 2023 clinics will likely consolidate. As it relates to retention of patients, that is an equation that goes -- that's part of that calculation, and we continue to see strong retention of patients wanting to stay at DaVita. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then just one last one for me kind of on an IKC follow-up, the number of Ares patients bounces around a little bit during the year. I'm just wondering what are the drivers of that in terms of attribution to you guys? And then is there an expectation like patient mortality in a certain sense, is sort of showing up there? And then on the med cost under management, just I guess what are the expectations for cadence and how that moves through 2023? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So there's nothing I'd call out in terms of the movement on the lives over the course of the year. Contracts go up or down, the number of lives in our SNF plans can move around a little bit. Some of it, I think this quarter was more around rounding than any major moves. In terms of medical spend under management. I think for next year, we expect that number to end somewhere in the $5 billion range with a lot of that growth coming at the beginning of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then sorry, let me squeeze in just 1 more here. You guys mentioned the commercial mix in MA. Just wondering kind of where that tracked in 4Q and then what's kind of embedded for year-end '23, just on the mix side. Javier Rodriguez : We ended the year with a mix of 10.4, and we don't usually give forward guidance on mix, but that's where we ended the year. Operator : Our next caller is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. I guess last quarter, you mentioned a lot about the missed treatment dynamic. Is there any update there? It sounds like you're saying it came in line with seasonality. I think it's back to normal? Or back as you would have expected based upon how things played out in Q3 plus Q4 seasonality. Javier Rodriguez : Kevin, on the missed treatments, we just highlighted that it was trending higher than it had historically by 1 percentage point. We also said that this is a dynamic that's going to take some time to, a, understand and then, b, fixed. And so in our guidance, we do not have any significant progress in there until we can really understand the dynamic and lower it. So it came in line in the sense that it wasn't modeled to improve in any dramatic way. Kevin Fischbeck : And so you're assuming that in your 0% to 3% to down 3% on guidance, it just stays stable? Javier Rodriguez : Correct. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then as far as the Medtronic JV goes, it sounds like $15 million a quarter the rest of this year, we're assuming -- when does that become breakeven in your minds? Is that kind of ratable to whatever that year is? Joel Ackerman : Yes, I'd say ratable to 2026 is a reasonable estimate. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And so if you're still going to be at 3.6% to 3.9% leverage, I guess, going back to earlier point, is it safe to assume that there probably won't be share repo in the first half of next year or 2? Or if you feel like there's core growth going on, you could potentially see that pathway to deleveraging that would allow you to start repo before you are kind of right at that range? Joel Ackerman : I think it's a little early to speculate, but we certainly want to retain the optionality to start the share repurchase program before we get there. I'm not saying we will, but we'd want to know that we've got a clear path to getting there. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess maybe going back to the mix point, you guys did highlight that I think it was 1/3 of the rate growth driver for 2023. Given that the expectation is that there's going to be some sort of recession at some point, I mean, I guess, directionally, it sounds like you're still assuming commercial is up. Is that a issue of member months and when those job losses happen, so it's more of a '24 pressure than '23 pressure? And then, I guess, if you could provide a little color, more color around where you are on the MA penetration side of things, and where you might think that can go over time? Javier Rodriguez : Well, let me grab the private pay mix and the recession impact. It will be, of course, very specific to what segments get impacted and how long the recession lasts because our patients have shown that they would like to get COBRA and maintain coverage. In addition, they've also kind of have had great success in their coverage in the exchanges. And so that would make it more resilient. And then, of course, if the recession is long-lasting, then who knows what the impact would be. But assuming that it is a normal recession and time length, I think that our patients have shown a tendency to want to keep their private insurance. On your second question, which I think was MA mix, we ended the year at 47.3%. What we continue to see is now we're into normal open enrollment and we have a little more of a tick now every quarter. And so it will continue to increase. And if you had to put a leveling place over the long term, I think it would be slightly below 50 or around 50 if you push me to speculate into the future. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. And then maybe just one last question. The cost-cutting initiative that you did, I mean, maybe it's just that there's more specificity as far as the charges and everything else that you outlined here. I just want to make sure that this is more or less kind of as you envisioned it last quarter? Or did you accelerate anything or do anything differently as Q4 played out? Javier Rodriguez : No. I think Joel said it well, we are doing what we said we would in Q3 along all the dimensions than we anticipated. The rest of the stuff remains. Operator : Andrew Mok with UBS. Andrew Mok : Great. Just a few numbers questions to follow up. Your D&A increased about $20 million sequentially. Is that from the new clinical IT investments? Or is there something else driving that DNA higher in the quarter? Is that a good number to think about for 2023 from a run rate perspective? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I think modeling consolidated D&A for 2023, I'd say we don't expect that to change very much from the full year 2022. Andrew Mok : So D&A will be flat even though it ticked up in the fourth quarter is what you're saying on a full year basis? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Andrew Mok : And what's driving the decrease? And is that from lower clinics? Joel Ackerman : I think the important thing here, Andrew, would be to focus on the DNA, you've got to exclude the costs associated with clinic closures and anything else. On a non-GAAP basis, I think you'll see it's relatively flat in Q4 over Q3. Andrew Mok : Okay. Got it. And then maybe just a quick update on home dialysis initiatives. Where is that tracking relative to long-term goals? And as you shut down clinics, should we expect that number to trend higher over time? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Our home mix ended up 15.2%, and that is tracking consistent to where we expected. We do not think there's a linkage between closing centers and having home mix increase, but rather the transitional centers that we talked about and making sure that our patients have home remote monitoring and other tools, so that they feel confident and connected and want to be able to go home. We're, in essence, also reeducating nephrologists so that they can be comfortable to have more patients at home. Those variables will be way more important than the centers because we're being so thoughtful as to which clinics we close, and so patients in essence still have access. Kevin Fischbeck : Got it. And maybe on that point, I think you touched on this briefly, but what exactly are you doing to ensure that you're retaining patients in the clinics that you do close? What are you doing to prevent any sort of leakage there? Javier Rodriguez : Well, the patients have choice, of course, and their nephrologists have choices and they can go wherever they deem appropriate for their life. But in general, we have relationships with them, and they feel comfortable with their care. And so when we sit with the patient and telling about a center closure, we tell them about their options, and then they choose. And many times, they feel comfortable staying within DaVita center. And then the ones that obviously choose to go somewhere else choose to go somewhere else, but the vast majority have decided to stay with DaVita and their nephrologist. Operator : And at this time, I am showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well, thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for your questions and for your continued interest in DaVita. I'll finish where I started with optimism for the year ahead. Although we will continue to stay away from any COVID predictions, I'm encouraged by our recent progress. As outlined today, we will continue to pursue our strategic priorities to create the best long-term capabilities and outcomes for our patients, teammates and shareholders. Thank you all for joining the call today, and be well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

Our forward looking statements are based on information currently available to us. And we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier J. Rodriguez: Thank you, Nic, and thank you all for joining the call today. 2023 is off to a strong start for DaVita. We entered the year with a cautious balance of optimism about our ability to execute against our plan and uncertainty about treatment volume in a challenging labor market. In the first quarter, we performed well on our key metrics and our results benefited from an improving macro environment. While some external uncertainties remain, the continuation of current trends would put us on a path to deliver strong results for the full-year. Before I get into the details about the quarter, I would like to elaborate on an area of our long-term strategy, which is to connect transitions of care through solutions for our patients across each step in the kidney care continuum. That leads me to our clinical highlight around CKD education. Periodically, we have provided updates on our community education program called Kidney Smart, raising awareness through education in the kidney care community is critical, particularly given the fact that 1 in 7 American adults have chronic kidney disease and the majority of these people are not aware. Our Kidney Smart program is designed to help those patients understand and manage their kidney health and is frequently recommended by nephrologist as a go to resource for patient education. To help remove the barriers to health equity, we've offered these classes in 10 different languages. In 2022, over 33,000 CKD patients attended the Kidney Smart class, a best ever for the 12-year history of the program. Moreover, in 2022, DaVita patients who attended Kidney Smart classes were more than twice as likely to choose a home modality in consultation with our nephrologist and care team. Transitioning to our financial performance. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted operating income of $352 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.58. As we discussed in prior quarters, we implemented a number of initiatives in the second half of 2022 to respond to the pressures associated with lower volumes and higher costs. These plans, combined with a strong operating rigor, translated into positive results in the quarter, and we're now seeing some of the operating metrics that impacted margin in 2022 begin to normalize. I'll start with the biggest driver of Q1 outperformance, labor. We made good progress on labor costs in the quarter, which reflected a combination of operating diligence and improvement in the overall labor environment. As we have said in the past, successful labor management requires effectively managing the interplay between wage growth, contract labor and training costs. Our operators continue to improve on the permanent staffing levels within our clinic, which has enabled us to drive further reduction in contract labor costs during Q1. We're tracking ahead of plan in our efforts to cut our full year contract labor expense in half relative to last year. The increase in permanent teammates, combined with elevated turnover, resulted in training cost in the quarter above historical norms, although below the peak we saw last summer. This is in line with our expectation, and we anticipate improvement in our training productivity in the back half of the year. This will largely depend on successful teammate retention which has historically tracked closely with the health of the broader labor market. Moving on to treatment volume. Quarter-over-quarter treatments per day were up approximately 1% and better than the middle of our expected range. This was driven by net census gains due to both higher admit and lower mortality. Because of the annualization of excess mortality from 2022, we still anticipate a reduction in overall treatment volume on a year-over-year basis and we continue to assume excess mortality over the balance of this year. That said, we're encouraged by our first quarter volume results. What we saw in Q1 proves to be a trend, we would expect to finish the year in the top half of our volume forecast range of down 3% to flat relative to 2022. Transitioning to a couple of strategic topics. On April 1, DaVita and Medtronic announced the launch of Mozarc Medical, a new independent device company focused exclusively on innovative kidney health technologies. Mozarc current products and its R&D pipeline ranging from kidney access technologies to advanced home dialysis and acute therapies are intended to improve the overall patient experience and increase access to home-based care. This investment reaffirms our commitment to realizing scale transformation in kidney care and allow us to fuel innovation in partnership with Medtronic, a global leader in healthcare technology. And finally note on integrated kidney care or IKC, We continue to make progress consistent with our business plan and demonstrate that our model of care is improving the health and well-being of our patients. I will highlight two examples of this. First, across our IKC program, more than half of our patients achieve an optimal start, which means the patient initiates dialysis treatment at home or appropriate vascular access in place. Optimal starts reduce costly and difficult hospitalizations and on average lead to a reduction in the continuing cost of care in the month and year that follow. Second, recent data continues to show an encouraging differentiation in hospitalization rates from patients in our IKC program versus our overall patient population. As we continue to scale our IKC business, which is measured by the total dollars of medical spend in our program, we will continue to focus on driving our net saving rate while pursuing a cost efficient model of care. In summary, looking across our most important operating metrics, we're seeing progress at a faster rate than assumed in our initial forecast. Therefore, we are revising our adjusted operating income range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion to a range of $1.475 billion to $1.625 billion and revising our adjusted earnings per share range of $5.45 to $6.95 to a range of $6.20 to $7.30. Aside from the COVID disruption in the labor market, other important factors for the remaining of the year include continued progress against our cost saving initiatives, which Joe will elaborate on and, of course, our continued effort to restore patient benefit protection to our advocacy efforts. I will now turn it over to Joe to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. I'll start with some additional commentary on first quarter results and then I'll add detail on our expectations for the remainder of the year. As Javier said, Q1 adjusted operating income was $352 million, adjusted EPS was $1.58 and free cash flow was $265 million. Overall, the results were at the high end of the range of our expectations for the quarter, driven roughly equally by three things; first, strong operating performance in the U.S. dialysis business; second, timing of certain items in our IKC results; and third, some normal positive variability in a couple of cost items that we are not forecasting to recur in the rest of the year. With that, let me provide some additional detail. First, U.S. dialysis treatments per day were up almost 1% in Q1 compared to Q4. As Javier mentioned, this was due to higher patient census. Mistreatment rates remained elevated compared to pre-COVID levels and were consistent with our expectations. Revenue per treatment was down $0.16 quarter-over-quarter, driven by normal seasonal impact of high patient responsibility offset by annual increases in Medicare fee for services rates that begin in January, growth of MA and seasonal increases in acute treatment. On a non-GAAP basis, patient care cost per treatment decreased by $1.18 sequentially. The biggest drivers of the change were pharmaceutical cost savings from anemia management transition to Mircera, reductions in our contract labor spend and positive variability in health benefits and insurance costs. These were offset by higher compensation costs and two fewer treatment days in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A expenses were down $24 million quarter-over-quarter largely due to normal variability in our G&A spend. IKC's adjusted OI for the quarter was approximately the same as Q4 and better than expected. The quarterly IKC results benefited from revenue that was forecasted to hit later in the year and the deferral of certain expense items that we expect will be recognized in Q3 and Q4. Excluding these items, IKC results were in line with our expectations. International adjusted operating income was up $12 million relative to Q4, driven roughly equally by foreign exchange and acquisition related expenses in Brazil during Q4. Looking at our capital structure, we ended the quarter with a leverage range of approximately 3.9 times EBITDA. We did not buy back any shares during the quarter as our focus continues to be to get back to our target leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5 times EBITDA. In the last week of April, we closed on a successful $2.75 billion refinancing of our revolving credit facility and term loan A despite a challenging capital markets environment. Looking forward, we still expect interest expense of $100 million to $110 million per quarter for the rest of the year. The April first launch of Mozarc Medical, our partnership with Medtronic will result in approximately $20 million of pre-tax losses below the OI line in Q2. This is less than previously shared due to timing shift of certain stand up costs. In the back half of the year, we still anticipate $15 million of negative impact on other income per quarter and as we shared previously, we expect Mozarc's OI to trend towards breakeven in approximately the next three years. Regarding the savings initiatives we've talked about in the past, we're on-track to realize year-over-year savings within the range of $125 million to $175 million consistent with prior expectations. This is primarily driven by a reduction in pharmaceutical cost and our ongoing facility consolidation. During Q1, we initiated our conversion to Mircera, which will continue to roll out over the remainder of the year. Additionally, in Q1, we consolidated 20 centers and currently anticipate consolidating another 40 to 50 centers over the remainder of the year. We continue to achieve high patient and teammate retention rates related to these shifts as the majority of patients at consolidated centers have transitioned to nearby DaVita facilities. That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks. Appreciate all the color. Joel, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing. You talked about higher turnover and lower temp labor costs. What's going on with turnover there? What are you expecting for the rest of the year? And how are labor cost tracking versus kind of the headwind that you had laid out for us? And then maybe given the upside in the quarter, what are you projecting for the rest of the year relative to Q1? And if you do hit these numbers, when do you think you get back to kind of your target leverage ratio and therefore the potential of buyback shares? Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez: Okay. Well, there's a lot in there. So let me just pull up for a second and then Joel can answer some of your follow-up questions. Justin, this is Javier. First, on labor, we started to give a little more color when we had more volatility in some of the underlying metrics, but I think it's a good time right now to pull up as you ask, which is a bigger number, but just so we're clear on all of the metrics. When you talk about SWBs, you take into account wages, productivity, benefits, training and contract labor. Within wages, there's obviously you can double click on that. You've got over time shift differential and other things. But let's stay with those five. In the third quarter of 2022, we had a spike in training and contract labor that we called out because they were outliers to our historical numbers. But then as we fast forward to today, we worry that people aren't fast enough with the math to calculate the interplay between the five. So let me see if I get to your number and if not, you can follow-up a question. So from 2018 to 2022, we had a CAGR of roughly 2% in SWBs. In 2022, which of course had that outlier that we were just talking about, that number went to roughly 8% growth. And in 2023 over 2022, we expect that number that incorporates all those variables to be more in the 4% to 5% growth. So does that answer the question on labor or do you want to ask a follow-up on that? Justin Lake : Yeah. Just mostly on labor, what I'm trying to figure out is versus that 4% to 5%, if you continue at this pace, where do you think you end up? Joel Ackerman : I'd say, Justin, we're thinking we're about $25 million ahead of where we thought we would be on the total labor cost. So if you think of our guide increase at the middle of the range of $50 million, I'd say half of that is labor and half of that is volume. And that's how I get to $25 million. Justin Lake : And is that just for the first quarter, Joel? And I'm kind of trying to think about like if this continues, does that mean you're 100 better? Joel Ackerman : Well, in the labor line itself, there were some items that we don't think will recur. They were good guys in lines like benefits in workers' comp that I'd strip out as you think about annualizing things. So the $25 million would be a full-year number. In terms of where we need to go from here, we're expecting continued wage pressure as the year presses on. There will be a little bit of improvement in contract labor, but we've seen most of the improvement in contract labor that we're likely to see because it just happened faster than we thought. And on the productivity side, we haven't seen much. We're off the peak that we saw in the middle of last year, but we're still well above pre-COVID levels. And what we're currently building in is some progress in the back half of the year, but ending the year still above pre-COVID levels. And that's really driven largely by the turnover that we're seeing. Justin Lake : That's helpful. I'll take the rest of my questions offline, Joel. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually [Nibiya Gutierrez] (ph) on for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. I have just another quick question on labor. You said you expect continued wage pressure in the year? What are you assuming for wage inflation this year? And how does it compare to last year and pre-COVID levels? Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez: Yes. I think it was really answered a little bit with Justin. So let me make sure we're asking the same thing. So we just basically said that if you take all of the variables into account that we think that SWBs will be 4% to 5% higher, 2023 over 2022. Does that answer your question? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thank you. And that's all. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Andrew Mok with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. Hi. Unidentified Analyst : This is Thomas on for [Andrew] (ph). Thanks for taking the question. Could you walk us through the underlying drivers of the treatment growth beat in the quarter as well as provide an update on how mistreatment rates are tracking sequentially? Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I like to use the treatment per day number and you'll see that that number is up about 90 bps quarter-over-quarter. That is largely driven by census increases and that's the result of admissions increases in Q1 offset by continued excess mortality, which is way down relative to prior years, but remains higher than it was pre-COVID. In terms of mistreatment rates, it continues to trend well above the pre-COVID number. It can move around from one quarter to the next. There's a lot of seasonality and other impacts in it, but we are still seeing it running roughly 100 basis points higher than what we saw pre-COVID. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up. I wanted to ask about the ESA switch to Mircera. Specifically, are there any KPIs you can share to track the transition? And do you have any update on the cadence of the rollout? Thanks. Javier J. Rodriguez: We do not have any disclosures on it. All I can tell you is that the rollout is going as well as we expected and that from a clinical perspective, we are seeing the results that we wanted. So it's going as planned. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks again. Javier J. Rodriguez: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next caller is Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon guys. So a follow-up here on Justin's question, on the $50 million operating income raise, you said half of the labor and half of better volumes. You added almost 60% new lives into IKC. I guess any changes on how that is tracking versus your previous guidance And then on the guidance raise, can you walk us through what $50 million of operating income is transitioning in $100 million of free cash flow? Is that just working capital or anything else in there? Javier J. Rodriguez: Let me take the first part of that and Joel can take the second part of that. On IKC, as you can imagine, it is a growing business and while we're making really good progress, it is clearly in the investment phase of the business. And so there is no change what we see the full year, we had a bit of timing in there. So the number looks a little better on a quarter-to-date than it will on an annualized basis, we're still on target to what we've said. Joel Ackerman : Yes, Pito, on the free cash flow as you pointed out, obviously, an increase in OI helps that. The other two things are one cash taxes are trending better than we expected. And the second is working capital. You see the DSOs were down considerably. So, we think we'll get a bit of a tailwind to that as well for the year. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then just on IKC for a second, realizing that when you add on 50%, almost 60% new lives, that's going to be sort of a drag as you guys think about those coming online. But any sort of color and sort of how the medical trust trends are tracking for your people that you had come into the year. I mean, we've seen spikes of utilization in other areas of healthcare, just curious kind of how that class of 2022 was tracking during the first quarter? Joel Ackerman : Yes, as you said, we agree. It's a little hard to say because we have so much noise and volatility because of COVID. And so there's not a lot to report what we're seeing is that the savings are coming in line to where we expect the model of care is a little less efficient than we want. We need to build more scale and we need to standardize a whole bunch of these things that right now are manual. So we're still work in progress. We're going a lot of things that we want to be and we're still expecting to be breakeven in 2026. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then so one last question here which won't shock you looking at the net growth sort of flat year-over-year definitely a lot better, sort of trending than we've seen sort of in the last several quarters, specs we're talking about sort of similar normalization of utilization. I guess any color you can give us on how many patients you guys added this quarter? How did that sort of track versus say 2022 versus pre-COVID? And then any more color you can give us on where mortality is tracking on current patient base today? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So let me walk you through some numbers, Pito, here. So the net census growth in Q1 was about 1,350 patients. If you compare that to what it was in Q1 of 2022 that was negative almost 500 patients. So an almost 2,000 patients swing, most of that is explained by the change in excess mortality although some of it is also the result of a better admit quarter this quarter than we saw last year. So on both the mortality side and the admit side, we saw progress. Pito Chickering : So on the admin side, I guess, can you give us a color of sort of the 1Q 2023 new ads and how that was, say 1Q 2019 just some comparison on a pre-COVID? Joel Ackerman : If you were to look at this excluding excess mortality, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you it was definitely higher this quarter than it was Q1 of 2019. That said, I would be cautious before we start extrapolating this out. This is one quarter of data, this metric historically has been variable quarter-to-quarter and I'd want to wait to see what happens for a few more months before we're ready to really declare a trend here. Pito Chickering : So just a last question on that one. So sorry to sort of keep going there, but you're looking at the U.S. RDS data, we go back for many years, the incidence rate of end stage renal disease has been fairly consistent for, I mean, nearly a decade. Are all signs you're seeing that we are returning to normalization of incidents rates and it's just too soon to lead to call it at this point? Javier J. Rodriguez: It's a little too early to call it. We've been studying and evaluating all different data sources and we're not ready to draw any conclusions. But there's a lot of movement upstream on the CKD population in particular with COVID. And so we will look because as you know there's some things that are making progression slower. On the other hand, there's things that are expanding life expectancy. And so our math is not leading to any conclusion at this point. Pito Chickering : And then last piece here, I promise I will stop here at least for now is on mortality, I guess, any color on sort of where the normal mortality was in excess mortality and sort of how we should think about both of those continuing in the back half of the year? And I'll stop there. Javier J. Rodriguez: Yes. So excess mortality was about 900 patients in the quarter. We have brought down slightly our expectations of excess mortality for the balance of the year but we're still looking at a number somewhere between 2,500 and 3000 patients. In terms of what's built into the middle of our guidance range. Pito Chickering : Great. I'll stop there. Javier J. Rodriguez: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Gary Taylor with Cowen. You may go ahead, sir. Gary Taylor : Hi, good evening. I think just two quick numbers, once for me, Joel, you had mentioned or at least in the release, some favorable items in G&A, including advocacy refund. Just wondering if you could size that for us? And then on IKC, I know there's a ton of moving parts there, but I'm just trying to sort of foot how the revenue was down $4 million sequentially from 4Q, but you said you had better than -- or some early revenue there and some delayed expense. So just trying to sort of foot down, but still including some early revenue recognition? Joel Ackerman : Sure. So, $6 million is the ballot number you're looking for. In terms of IKC, we saw about $20 million roughly half in the revenue line, half in the expense line that we were expecting, we were just expecting it later in the year. In terms of the timing of the revenue, we generally view IKC revenue to be back half of the year loaded. As you think about the claims lags filling up or maturing and then ultimately the calculations on shared savings being done, that usually happens in the back half of the year and that's when we'll recognize the shared savings dollars. That's why you see the decline from Q4 with still call it a positive timing surprise. Gary Taylor : Got it. Perfect. Thank you. Javier J. Rodriguez: Thank you, Gary. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Alright, sorry, guys. I just had a couple of things I wanted to come back to you on. So ready for treatment sort of flattish sequentially primarily due to sort of seasonal copays. Just curious -- two questions, I guess, what are you seeing from managed care on cost limiting updates? And then how should we think about revenue per treatment sort of going for the rest of the year? Javier J. Rodriguez: Yes. Thanks, Pito. A couple of things. We're not seeing anything to report on from the managed care negotiations and just to refresh you, we've talked about our contractor multi-year in any given year, we negotiated roughly about 20% or so of our portfolio and we're not seeing anything different in this year. What we've talked about in Q4 last year is that we said we would get a revenue per treatment increase year-over-year from 2% to 2.5%, 2023 over 2022. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. And then, so on efficiencies from closing centers. You had sort of closed 20 this quarter. You talked about consolidating another 40 to 50 centers. I guess how much sort of savings do you think you're going to realize in 2023 from those center consolidations just solely on that line? And how much of that then should trend through for 2024? Javier J. Rodriguez: Yes. So we haven't quantified the number. We've always said it will be part of the $125 million to $175 million but not the biggest piece. The biggest piece of that is Mircera. We'll get -- so that'll be in 2023. There'll still be some amount that will rollover into 2024, but we'll get most of it in 2023. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then sort of last one here for me. What \u2013 I may have missed it, but what was the contract labor dollars this quarter? What are you seeing for the rest of the year? And then any color on what you're hiring was and net hiring was in the first quarter? Javier J. Rodriguez: Yes. So I think what we said was that in the year, last year, remember contract labor was running around hundred million and we said for the year this year, we'd be half of that and now today we move that -- we are moving better -- at a better pace. So that number will be more like $35 million. But again, I would point you to the beginning of the conversation where we said the most important part is the interplay between all the variability of all those metrics because, of course, training productivity wages, benefits and contract labor are all intertwined, but that's the number. Pito Chickering : And I guess the second part is just can you quantify for us the number of hires you had in quarter and what the net hires was after turnover? And how that should trend throughout the year? Because you mentioned about lower trading costs as this batch sort of comes online just how you\u2019re thinking - quantify the first. Javier J. Rodriguez: Yes. So here's the way I'd think about the training cost. They peaked last year as a result really of two things, higher turnover combined with the need for us to net add staff and those combined to a high training level. As we sit here today, the turnover remains elevated. It's gotten better on with some class of late birth than others. But it still remains elevated. So we're expecting continued high training levels until that comes down. We're modeling the back half of the year but we are much closer or at fully staffed. So some of the training associated with getting the staffing levels back up is now done and that will mitigate some of the training costs relative to the peak we saw in Q3 last year. Pito Chickering : So, when you talk about sort of the 4% to 5% increase in SMB, I guess, how much of that is sort of more of a one -- it comes from the training costs that are embedded within the guidance that should roll off as you think about 2024? Javier J. Rodriguez: Not a lot. The change in contract labor is a much bigger tailwind relative to 2022 in the training productivity. And that's -- it's partly because we're not going to see the training productivity improve till the back half of the year. It's also partly because in the beginning of 2022, training productivity was still low. So we saw the spike in Q3, but that was only one quarter. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it. Javier J. Rodriguez: Thank you, Pito. Operator : And at this time, I am showing no further questions. Javier J. Rodriguez: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for the questions. As I hope you've heard today, we have some positive momentum to start the year that the results of Q1 proved to be sustainable trend. We're excited about the implications for our patients, our teammates, and our financial performance in 2023 and beyond. Thank you all for joining the call and be well. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you, Mr. Eliason, you may begin your conference. Nic Eliason : Thank you, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Nic Eliason, Group Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our second quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Quarter on Form 10-K, all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward looking statements are based on information currently available to us. And we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you Nic, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that everyone's having a safe and joyful summer. At DaVita, we've been focused on innovation and continuous improvement to provide the highest quality care for our patients. Hand-in-hand with these efforts, we've been driving operational improvements across our organization. Our second quarter performance reflects strong traction across those initiatives, putting us on a path to deliver strong clinical outcomes and financial results for the year. Today, I will cover the second quarter results, offer some perspective on the industry landscape and drivers of long-term performance and update our full year guidance. Before we get into the second quarter details, I would like to take a moment to celebrate a clinical and technological milestone. On our February call, we mentioned the rollout of our next generation clinical IT system, which we refer to as Center Without Walls or CWOW. I'm happy to report that after five years of development, CWOW is now alive in each of our approximately 2,700 clinics across the United States. This patient-centric cloud-based system combines and replaces four legacy systems and is designed to provide seamless flow of information across each of our centers in all modalities. This includes real-time clinical dashboards, data sharing with our physicians and integrated kidney care platforms, and notifications such as critical lab alerts. For ease of use, it features wristbands for quick teammate login, improve ability to track and reschedule mistreatment, enhance real-time documentation, and consolidate it reporting for streamlined analysis. And while we're enthuse about these immediate benefits, the most significant enhancement is the state-of-the-art data structure and platform upon which we can build further capabilities, including artificial intelligence to advance the care delivery in the years ahead. With this groundbreaking platform, our clinicians are able to access the right information at the right time in the right place. Transition to our financial performance. In the second quarter, we delivered a adjusted operating income of $432 million in adjusted earnings per share of $2.08. These results were driven by improvements across our financial trilogy of treatment volume, revenue treatment, and patient care costs. I'll touch on each of these in a bit more detail. On volume, we saw our second consecutive quarter of improvements in census and treatments per day. This is encouraging, as it's the result of better macro-environment and progress in our operating initiatives. We're turning near the top of our original volume range of down 3% to flat year-over-year, and if these trends continue, we would anticipate delivering volume growth in 2024. Shifting to revenue and revenue per treatment. Revenue per treatment was particularly strong in the quarter. This was primarily driven by typical seasonal factors from patients meeting their copays and deductibles, along with normal expected rate increases and improvement in mix, including Medicare Advantage. Adding to the RPT increase, we have seen progress from investments we've been making in our revenue cycle capabilities. These investments resulted in higher cash collections and a decline in our DSO. I'm excited about the investments we've been making in these areas, which represent a good example of how we are constantly improving operations. And finally, patient care costs improved as expected in the quarter. Although base wage increases remain well above historic pre-pandemic levels, other expenses, including contract labor and pharmaceuticals continue to decline. This benefit was partially offset by elevated training costs. While staffing level in our clinic are in a much better position compared to last year, we continue to experience above average turnover among facility teammates. As a result, we no longer expect an improvement in our training productivity during the back half of this year. Taking a step back for the most recent results, I would like to offer some reflections on the broader industry landscape and our effort to drive performance going forward. Beginning with the reimbursement rates. We are disappointed by CMS's proposal to update the ESRD perspective payment system for 2024. Specifically, the proposed rate increased false short of expected cost inflation in 2024. And it failed to adjust for the acknowledged inflation forecast miss relative to actual wage and inflation increases over the past two years. The kidney care community will continue to advocate for an adjustment mechanism to reconcile these forecasters similar to what exists today for skilled nursing facilities. In response to the persistent cost inflation, we are continuing our track record of innovation across all areas of our cost structure. Most recently, we consolidated portions of our facility footprint and reduced pharmaceutical costs through our conversion to Mircera for anemia management. These programs are proceeding in line with our expectations. Going forward, we will continue to drive cost efficiencies across the P&L. Through these efforts and continued improvement in our volume trend, we continue to target 3% to 7% long-term growth of our enterprise adjusted operating income. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, given our progress during the second quarter, we are advising our adjusted operating income range of $1.475 billion to $1.625 billion to a new range of $1.565 billion to 41.675 billion. We are also updating our adjusted earnings per share range of $6.20 to $7.30 to a new range of $7 to $7.80. Our performance relative to this guidance will continue to depend heavily on momentum and patient census trends, our ability to manage patient care costs within the broader labor environment and sustain improvement in revenue cycle management. I will now turn the call to Joel to discuss financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. I will walk through a few factors driving our strong performance in the second quarter, starting with treatment volume. In the second quarter, U.S. Dialysis treatments per day were up by approximately 0.3 percent sequentially. This is the result of continued census gains in the second quarter, driven by an increase in new to dialysis admits. Mortality remains higher than pre-COVID levels, but came in lower than Q1 and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our mistreatment rate continues to be elevated relative to historic levels. Revenue per treatment was up $10.59 versus Q1. Approximately half of this increase was the result of seasonality, primarily due to higher patient responsibility amounts in the first quarter. Approximately $2 came from normal expected rate increases and continued increases in patient mix. An additional roughly $2 was the result of strong cash collections in Q2. As Javier said, we have been investing in improvements in our revenue cycle management systems and processes and are beginning to see the benefits of these efforts in both RPT and DSOs. We were anticipating these improvements, but they came earlier than forecasted. We expect these benefits to persist in the back half of the year and going forward. As a result, we now anticipate year-over-year RPT growth to be 2.5% to 3%. On a non-GAAP basis, patient care cost per treatment decreased 1.5% sequentially. While base wage increases remain high, we have successfully reduced most of the temporary compensation measures we relied on during 2022. At the end of Q2, contract labor has returned back to pre-pandemic levels. Operating income from our integrated kidney care business was approximately flat with Q1. The quarter benefited from positive prior period developments in our special needs plans and the timing of expenses that were delayed until later this year. For the full year, we now expect IKC adjusted operating income to be approximately flat to 2022 operating income loss of $125 million. Regarding our clinic footprint, in Q2, we closed or consolidated 16 centers in the U.S. bringing our year to-date U.S. closures to 36. We continue to assess further facility consolidation and closures during the back half of the year. Regarding capital structure, we ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of approximately 3.7 times EBITDA and did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on capital efficient growth, a target leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5 times EBITDA and the return of excess cash flow to investors through share buybacks. Given our increased guidance for the balance of the year, we have increased visibility towards bringing our leverage level back within our target range. That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first color is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Joanna Gajuk : Good afternoon. Actually, this is Joanna Gajuk filling for Kevin. Thanks for taking the Q&A question here. So, thanks for the color around the revenue per treatment and breakdown in terms of the drivers. There are included very strong performance and I appreciate a commentary aspect. I guess a fast group for the year. Just looking into the pieces because you said a better payer mix one of the drivers, can you talk about the specific commercial pricing and what kind of rating increases are you getting this year and also any indications for how things are tracking into next year? Because I guess that's where maybe one area, because you also mentioned a Medicare rate out there being lower than cost inflation. So, is the commercial pricing gets tracking better? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thank you for the question, Joanna. I'll start off and Joel, you can supplement if I miss anything of importance. Private pay mix is holding up. It picked up 20 bps and we continue to see that our private pay patients really value their insurance. As it relates to rate increases, just a reminder, most of our contracts are multi-year. So, in any given year, we don't negotiate that many contracts. There's nothing really to call out on that. Our rate per treatment increases are in line with expectations. So, is there another part of your question that I didn't answer, Joanna? Joanna Gajuk : No, this was -- yes, this was it, but I guess also related, if I kind of follow-up to that topic, in terms of the Marietta case, and I guess we spoke before. Are there's still bipartisan support for a fix. So, can you give us any update on that? And I guess on that topic, as it relates to pricing, commercial pricing, are you seeing employers using this court decision to restrict networks or are they using it to maybe, they bring it up in the price negotiations when it comes to pricing? Javier Rodriguez : Sure. Let me take a minute, and let me lend up a little to some people who are not tracking all of the Marietta, so it's probably best for me to divide it into what we know and what we don't know. So, let me start with what we do know. As we look at our claims year to date, we have not seen much change compared to prior years, so there's not a lot of volume. But we have learned more about how employers change benefits and mislead members on how it's done. And so we don't want to accommodate this poor behavior. So what we have done is we've implemented a verification process at admissions, and if an employer eliminates the network, dialysis benefit for its member, then we have the right to prevent that plan from having access to our centers. In addition, we continue to have very high interest, bipartisan interest and making sure that policy makers protect our patients. So those are the things that we do know. What we don't know is how many employer groups are considering carving out dialysis from network in the future. And we also don't know if or when members of Congress will introduce the bill and how the CBO will score it. The last part of your question was, are payers using this in one way or another? And it has not come up in one negotiation, because this is really more of a dynamic between the employer, trying to decide what to do with the plan, not what the payer does with the provider. The provider and the payer both value network. Does that help you, Joanna? Joanna Gajuk : Yes, that makes sense. No, no, that totally makes sense and I appreciate it. So in terms of what's going on in Congress and the score. Is there any indication what we might hear about this or that's not really something that we can predict from the outside? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. There's nothing we can predict from the outside. That's left to policy makers, champions, and the dynamics of Washington, D.C. Joanna Gajuk : Great. Thank you. And if I maybe just on the guidance phase, but it sounds like some improvement in the pricing rate and then I guess contract labor, sounds like that's better. Is that the way to frame the guidance phase of $70 million of the operating income, just the operating income guidance? Joel Ackerman : Yes, Joanna, if I were to kind of give you the pieces of what drove $70 million of increased guidance, that's middle of the range to middle of the range on OI. I'd say about half is the RPT, as you called it out. The other half is volume. We saw stronger admissions this quarter and the nature of volume is it's cumulative. It'll never really kick in any one quarter in that big a way, but as it accumulates, stronger in Q1, stronger in Q2, and we see it better in the back half of the year. For the full year, we think that'll contribute about half of the $70 million. Contract labor, it continues to improve, but it's now pretty much in line with what we were expecting. And as we said in the prepared remarks, it's really back down to pre-COVID levels, and hopefully it won't be much of a topic going forward. Joanna Gajuk : Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks for the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next caller is Andrew Mok with UBS. Sir, you may go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi, good afternoon. Appreciate all the color on the sequential RPT improvement, but a couple of follow-ups there. First, is the seasonality component in line with historical seasonality, or is there something about the patient benefit design that's creating more acute seasonality this year? And can you go into a bit more detail on what's driving the better cash collections? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Andrew, thanks. So on the seasonality, no, it was a little bit more than $5 per treatment, which is right in line with what we've seen historically. In terms of collections, look, we have invested in our processes and in our technology to get better information and to give better information to the health plans on everything from prior authorizations to other data required to claim submissions. And that's both the quality of the data and the timeliness of the data. And what we're seeing is we're getting paid quicker, and that's why you saw DSOs come down last quarter. And again, this quarter, and we're also seeing we're collecting more, and that's what's driving the RPT increase. And I think the most important thing from our standpoint is not a one-time thing. These are fundamental changes that we've made, that we think will persist. Andrew Mok : Great, appreciate the call. And then as a follow-up, the guidance, the OI guidance is up about 5%. I think your free cash flow is up about 10%. Can you help bridge the difference there? Or help us understand why the free cash conversion is better on the new guide? And I think I missed your comments on share repurchase, but we'd love to get your latest thoughts around there and the potential resumption of share repurchase? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So the big difference between OI and free cash flow is the DSOs. As we see those DSOs come down, that'll add to the free cash flow for the year. In terms of share repurchases, we're on track with what we set out to do. Our leverage levels were above our target range. I think we were quite clear with everyone. We wanted to get back down to 3.5 or below. We're making good progress on that. We're at 3.7 for the quarter, and we didn't buy back any shares. We don't expect to buy back any shares in Q3, but we feel like we've got better visibility now to get back to the 3.5 or below. Andrew Mok : Great. Thank you. I'll hop back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Sir, you may go ahead. Javier Rodriguez : Hey, Pito. Operator : Pito, your line is open. We'll go to the next caller. Lisa Clive with Bernstein. You may go ahead. Lisa Clive : Hi, there. Apologies, Javier, if you touched on this in the opening remarks. I was a few minutes late. But just could you comment on the CMS rate increase and the fact that they made a mistake in the calculations and what the chances are of getting an improvement there? And also, just as we think about going into 2025, what would a fair rate increase look like, and perhaps what lower numbers should our expectations around that actually be? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thanks for the question, Lisa. It's kind of funny. I've been here for a very long time, and not many questions used to come up about the rate increase with Medicare. And so, we started to ask ourselves, why is this a new dynamic? And the reality is that the system is quite complicated, but it works relatively well in times where there's economic stability. And yet, when we're experiencing times of inflation or lack of stability, it's really showing that it doesn't work in many ways. So let me step back. If you were to spend time on trying to understand the methodology, you would really come to the conclusion that it is practically not possible to forecast, because there's just too many things that are either proprietary or use lag data or a benchmark that is not related to dialysis. It's a benchmark related to all healthcare costs, and it's all weighted and then discounted with some kind of productivity factor. And so, the short answer is, it's a big, complicated equation with some variables that we will not have visibility to. So that's the short answer. We can't forecast it. I can't believe anyone from the outside world can. Secondly, what is an appropriate one and what we are advocating for is, let's not have -- let's call it winners or losers. We understand that forecasting is difficult, but let's have a reconciliation that is actually linked to actual costs. And if you get an increase and exceeds what inflation, that there could be a decrease or vice versa. So that's what we're advocating for. As you know, it is very difficult in Washington, D.C. right now on trying to get funding, but we are trying to make our case. Lisa Clive : And maybe just touching on MedPAC's role here. I mean, they're sort of, well, the economic advisor to Medicare, but they don't have any enforcement power. And I think there's sometimes, some years, there's a big disconnect between the MedPAC recommendation and the rate, and then this year it was actually quite in line. I mean, from your perspective, do you guys even look at the MedPAC numbers? I think it seems like it should be a useful data point, but it often isn't? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. The process from MedPAC is a bit opaque to us. We try to educate and highlight what is really happening with our cost structure. And, again, in periods of stability, it happened to be, give or take, within reason, acceptable. And now the gap is widening, and it's widening compounded year-after-year. So, it's really starting to be significant. Lisa Clive : Okay. And then last follow-up is, just given how the rate increase was. Does this change your decision on some clinic closures in any way? Because obviously that's always the worry, that if the Medicare rates get too low, you just have clinics here and there where you're on all Medicare and it just doesn't financially make sense anymore? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. There's lots of go into the decision to close the clinic, in particular, we've got to really focus on patient care and make sure that our patients are being taken care of. But it is absolutely a consideration when you look at the economics, but sort of the first filter is continuity of care. The second is, is there a convenient place for that patient can be taken care of. And then after that, you get into economic factors such as reimbursement, leases, and other things, but we are aggressively looking at our footprint, and we continue to right-size to make sure that we are thoughtful about our resource allocation and capital allocation. Lisa Clive : Great, thanks for that. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next color is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Sir, you may go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey, can you guys hear me now? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, Pito. Pito Chickering : All right, sorry about that. I'm not sure happened there. Back to treatment growth here. In pre-COVID, like you're getting about 4,000 new patients a year, about two-thirds of those in the first half the year from nephrologist dropping on and obviously, the rest coming from hospitalizations and start talking to you guys. I guess, how is that tracking this year at this point relative to sort of that 4,000 times two-thirds? Is that what do you guys are seeing for new patients at this point? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. So Pito, the short answer is if you're looking at admits, we are tracking pretty much to pre-COVID levels. The challenge is excess mortality, and that remains elevated. And that's the reason that we're not yet ready to say we're going to return to pre-COVID growth levels. That said, mortality has been coming down year-after-year since COVID started. It's down Q2 versus Q1. So, if mortality continued to decline and return to pre-COVID levels, then the math you laid out of 4,000 new patients a year, we'd be back there. Pito Chickering : Which is a perfect segue for the next question about mortality. You talked about that sort of coming down. I guess is there any way you can give us, or what is the rate of that decline. And if it follows the path you've seen in the last three quarters, is this, so what glide path would that indicate? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. That's a -- it a tough piece of analysis to do, because it hasn't necessarily been smooth quarter-to-quarter or a year-to-year. So, look, we're watching it carefully. We all know there's a minor surge going on, but I think minor is the operative word from what we've seen so far. So, we're keeping a careful eye on it, but I don't think we can draw a trend line based on the history to say when we think mortality gets back to zero. Where excess mortality gets back to zero. Pito Chickering : Okay. Is there something they can quantify for what excess mortality was this quarter and what is there was for the last quarter? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Last quarter, it was roughly 900 lives. This quarter, it was between 500 and 600. Remember, we will sometimes update those over time. We get better views of excess mortality as time goes on. But somewhere between 500 and 600 is our best estimate for Q2. Pito Chickering : Okay. And I definitely understand sort of the complexity of coming up with those for a variety of different reasons. For Medicare Advantage what percent of your MA patients are currently taking risk for one way or another? Javier Rodriguez : I'd have to do the math quickly in my head. Pito, I don't want to give you a bad number, so I'm going to -- let's take that off line. Pito Chickering : Okay. The next one here is, on managed care rate increase question that was asked earlier. I guess, are you seeing managed care do anything different in terms, not just in rate increases, but potentially trying to your patients? Like, if you've seen any behavior changes for managed care in the last 90 days or so, just, obviously you're seeing increase relation elsewhere, just curious that they're trying to control costs within other parts of the business? Javier Rodriguez : No, we haven't seen no changes at all. Pito Chickering : Okay. Got it. And then, so last one here. On the pace of consolidation for facilities, obviously, you guys do the lowest-hanging fruit, first. But as you see success of capturing those patients serve within other centers, do you get more aggressive about consolidation that maybe you had originally planned for about a year from now? And when this patients are consolidated, do you see an increase of local treatments at that point? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I think we want to be really careful about being \"aggressive\". But we want to be really thoughtful and balanced in all the trade-off to go into closing a center. We have to remember, our patients are incredibly vulnerable. And one of the most important things is to be close to their home. And so, 90 somewhat percent of our patients are within 10 miles of their home. And that is one of the best things we can offer convenient. And we talk a lot about health equity issues and not being in the communities. We are in the communities. And so we take that pretty seriously. But as the economics constraints happen, and if we are able to accommodate our patients, we are being very thoughtful on that. And we have other obligations like leases and other thing. So there's a natural time to review a clinic to see if it's appropriate for closure. Pito Chickering : Okay. Javier Rodriguez : And then the second part to your question, I think, Pito. Pito Chickering : Yes. So, I'll ask some questions in different ways. I guess, as if the patient is consolidated, do you see an increase in the utilization of home treatments? And then, the second part of the question is, to what percent of treatments today are being done in the home? Javier Rodriguez : No, is the answer. We are not seeing any changes in whether a patient goes home or not. We continue to be a very much an advocate of home. There's a lot of dynamics and education that go into that. And we want the right modality for the right patient. But we are huge home champions. And the mix on home is roughly around 15%. A little above that, like 15.2% or so, but it's been hanging around that 15%. COVID had a big impact on home that many patients felt more comfortable in that time of insecurity to go and be taken care of by professionals. But we're starting to see a slight pick up in patient choice to go home. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then, I think a last question for me here. Can we get an update on the Medtronic JV? I guess, so, how much sort of on to the drag is that on OI. And just as you look at it today, kind of what's the pathway to that becoming operating income neutral, and can you just refresh us sort of why that's good opportunity for you guys? Thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Sure. Just as a reminder, it doesn't hit our operating income. It's below the OI line. So it hits EPS. It's worth about $15 million pre-tax per quarter. That's on a non-GAAP basis. This quarter we actually had some positive gain as a result of the transaction. And we think that number will decline over the next couple of years. And we anticipated getting to breakeven in two to three years. In terms of why we like this. Look, as Javier mentioned, we're really interested in figuring out ways to help our patients get home and new technology can be part of that answer. We're looking for other ways to innovate beyond just the service and information, capabilities that we can do. And we recognize Medtronic as a world-class leader in innovation on the medical device side. And we just thought their history here combined with our knowledge would make for a great partnership, which is why we invested in Mozarc. Pito Chickering : Perfect. And the last quickie for me. I may be missed it. Did you guys quantify what the turnover was, nurses and technicians for this quarter and how that compares versus 2019? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Thank you for that last question. We did not go into that level detail. I think what we can say on labor, because we've gone into so much detail in labor. In the overall category, it is playing out as expected. Some of the underlying components have shifted a bit. And so just to give a little more detail on that. Base wages are above our normal averages. Our contract labor is back in line to normal. And we continue to have elevated training. And so that's how the leverage are moving. But overall, the category is as expected. Pito Chickering : Great. I'll stop there. Thank you guys very much. Thank you Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : And at this time I am showing no further questions, sir. We do have one more question. Andrew Mok from UBS. You may go ahead, sir. Andrew Mok : Hi. Just a couple follow-ups on the clinic closures. You closed down 16 clinics, but opened 10 new dialysis clinics. I'm just trying to better understand what's driving the new clinics at this point given, I thought a lot of the clinic closures was a result of excess mortality. So what are you seeing in the market that's causing you to open new clinics that are -- are there any characteristics that you would call out about them whether they're home dialysis programs or anything like that? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : In general you can imagine health care is local, and so there are areas where there are literally full clinics. There's sometimes relocations. Sometimes as you called out there might be just a home center that was needed. So there's a little of all, but as you can see the number is materially smaller as we are very focused on making sure that capacity utilization is where it needs to be and that we're capital efficient. Andrew Mok : Got it. And on the mortality, I think you gave us the absolute number in the quarter. Can you give us a sense or how the mortality rate in general is tracking and how far off are you against pre-pandemic levels? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : The mortality level looks, roughly a percentage or so higher than pre-pandemic. And as Joel talked about it, it's a bit cyclical and depending on the surge. There is one or sort of the front end tends to have higher mortality in the front end of the year or the back end in the year versus the middle of the year, but I think a good number is roughly one percent or give or take 2,000 patients. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for all the color. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well, thank you Michelle and thank you all for your questions. As you heard through our comments today, we've continued to drive operational efficiencies and make investments to feel our performance now and to the future years as well. Some of those seeds that we planted are beginning to sprout and some will take additional time and continued effort. We look forward to keeping you updated on our continued progress in the back half of the year. Thank you for joining the call and be well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Eliason, you may begin your conference. Nic Eliason : Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Nic Eliason, Group Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; and Dr. Jeff Giullian, our Chief Medical Officer. Please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward looking statements are based on information currently available to us. And we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you Nic, and thank you all for your interest in DaVita. We delivered another strong quarter. We began the year by making progress earlier than expected across many of our key operating priorities and that momentum has continued into the third quarter. We have balanced a strong focus on near-term operating discipline, while continuing to invest for future growth. At the same time, we're creating a differentiated experience for our teammates, and of course, delivering the highest standard of care for our patients. Today, I will address our outperformance in the third quarter, share a perspective on the potential impact of GLP-1 drugs, provide an update on 2023 guidance, and then wrap up with some thoughts on next year. Before we get into third quarter details, I'd like to start as I always do with a clinical highlight. This time, I will highlight our international business, which provides care for more than 40,000 patients across 11 countries. Each country is unique in terms of health status, local methods of practice, and regulation. Over the past 5 years, we have developed universal protocols to combine our kidney care experience with local practices within each country. Since launching this proprietary framework, we have seen consistent and meaningful improvement in clinical outcomes. We now outperform the clinical benchmarks of every international market in which we operate. And at the aggregate level, all cost patient mortality across our international countries has dropped by 20% since 2020. These results energize the soul of our company, which is to extend life and improve the quality of life of our patients. Transitioning to our financial performance, we had a strong third quarter, delivering adjusted operating income of $525 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.85. This was ahead of our expectations for the quarter. We continue to perform well across our key operating metrics, and also had additional benefit related to seasonality and timing. Now, let me go to the next level of detail and highlight three drivers including patient census, patient care costs, and integrated kidney care or IKC. First, our patient census has remained steady following the growth we saw in the first half of the year. And we expect to end the year with a census of 1,500 to 2,000 patients higher than the end of 2022. Mortality continues to decline in 2023 in line with our expectations. Assuming these trends continue, we expect to return to positive volume growth in 2024 and beyond. Second, patient care costs continue to decrease during the third quarter. Outside of the seasonal items, the conversion to Mircera for anemia management was the key driver of the decrease. That said wage growth remains above historical trends and exceeds growth in revenue per treatment, but was below our expectations for the quarter. Our experience on labor is consistent with recent macro economic trends. The tight labor market and low unemployment has continued to put pressure on retention and training, offset by slight easing in the wage environment. And finally, our IKC business had a strong quarter and is tracking ahead of our forecast for the year. We are improving patient health outcomes and reducing the total cost of care, which generates savings that is shared between DaVita and our partners. We also realized that revenue associated with these savings earlier in the year than anticipated. We continue to invest in growth while carefully managing our model of care costs and we remain on track with our multiyear plan to achieve breakeven by 2026. Transitioning to a topic of recent focus, there's been a lot of discussion on GLP-1 drugs, including speculation on their potential impact to dialysis growth rate. We are excited by the evidence that these drugs could improve the health of many people worldwide. That said, despite the evolving body of evidence about the positive impact of these drugs will have on obesity, diabetes and cardiac disease, we continue to believe that the impact on dialysis volumes will be limited. We believe this is true even if results from near-term clinical trials proved to be positive in regards to progression of chronic kidney disease or CKD. To explain our perspective, it is important to segment the population based on disease state. In the group that is upstream from CKD Stage 3, it is intuitive that lower obesity should lead to lower incidence of diabetes and hypertension, lower incidence of chronic kidney disease and ultimately fewer people on dialysis. This thesis is built on many uncertainties within a progressive disease, but the one area where we can have clarity is in regards to timing. In this population, the progression to end stage renal disease is typically 15 to 20 years or longer. Suffice to say, this scenario is beyond the horizon of our strategic plan. Now, turning at late stage CKD population. We believe that there are four key factors. First, GLP-1 adoption rate in CKD population. Second, the impact on CKD progression. Third, the offset impact of cardiac mortality benefit, and finally, the impact on payer mix due to any changes in the average patient age. For the purpose of building a conservative forecast, we assume robust adoption and long-term adherence, supported in part by the possibility of strong uptake by those who may take GLP-1s for obesity, rather than for the CKD benefit. We also looked at a wide range of possible clinical impact from current and future clinical trials. Stimulating across these assumptions, the midpoint of our model reflects a neutral impact on 10-year dialysis growth rates with a small, but immaterial impact on payer mix. We recognize this may not sound intuitive, which is why we must consider several misunderstood characteristics about kidney disease. If we look at the approximately 16 million people in the U.S today, with CKD Stage 3 and beyond, over the next 10 years, approximately 75% will pass away before reaching end stage kidney disease. This compares to less than 10% of those individuals who will ultimately progress to dialysis. Since major adverse cardiac events are the single largest cause of this mortality, the positive impact of reduced cardiac event has a much larger population to influence than the effect of timing from slower disease progression. To better quantify the downside case on dialysis growth, we also model the scenario in which efficacy is found across all kidney endpoints in each of the flow and select trials with zero offsetting cardiac mortality benefits. This scenario, which should be clear is not something we expect reflects a 0.5% annual growth headwind over the same 10-year period based on our model. This would equate to approximately $25 million of operating income headwind per year. Let me wrap up by acknowledging the disconnect between our view and what we believe is the markets perspective. To be clear, the disconnect is not related to the popularity of GLP-1 or their numerous health benefit, but specific to the impact on kidney care. Because of this, we have pressure tested our analytics with external epidemiologists and consultants with extensive review available research and across a wide band of assumptions. We are focused not on the midpoint, but on the downside scenario on volume, and incorporated possible financial headwinds from lower commercial mix. In the end, our conclusion, based on what we know today, is that strong adoption of these drugs will not prevent us from achieving our long-term operating income growth targets in the next 10 years. This is a complicated topic, and we're happy to elaborate or answer any questions on our assumptions. Transitioning topics. Looking forward to our fourth quarter, we are revising our 2023 adjusted operating income guidance range of $1.565 billion to $1.675 billion to a new range of $1.65 billion to $1.725 billion. We are also updating our adjusted earnings per share range of $7 to $7.80 per share to a new range of $7.80 to $8.30 per share. It's too early to give guidance for next year, but we expect 2024 to be a year of positive growth in volume and adjusted operating income. Despite continued cost pressures and our ongoing commitment to invest in our teammates, we expect the midpoint of our 2024 adjusted operating income guidance will fall within our long-term target growth rate of 3% to 7%, driven by continued progress on our operating initiatives. We will provide more detail during our fourth quarter call. With that, I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. I will walk through the strong performance in the quarter, provide some detail about how we are thinking about the fourth quarter and give an update on capital deployment. Starting with volume, Q3 was in line with our expectations. U.S dialysis treatments per day and census were approximately flat to the second quarter. For the first time since the pandemic began, we've now experienced three sequential quarters of year-over-year growth in admits. Trailing 12 months mortality rate continues to decline, we are now approaching pre-pandemic levels of mortality rate as we once again improved quarter-over-quarter. Revenue per treatment was up $3.60 versus Q2. This increase was the result of continued improvements in our revenue cycle performance as well as normal contracted rate increases and an uptick in private pay mix. For the full year, we expect to be near the top end of the 2.5% to 3% year-over-year RPT range that we shared last quarter. Looking ahead to 2024, the Medicare PPS final rate for ESRD was released last week. Despite CMS acknowledging that the 2022 forecast error was larger than originally calculated, the net rate update finalized for 2024 was only 2.1%, which is still below what we believe is appropriate given continued forecasting errors, current inflation and other rising costs. That said, we continue to find ways to expand margin despite RPT increases below current inflation trends. Non-GAAP patient care cost per treatment was down $2.30 sequentially. As Javier mentioned, this was the result of a number of items including the conversion to Mircera for anemia management. In IKC, quarter-over-quarter results improved by $50 million due to two factors. First, we recognized approximately $45 million more of shared savings revenue in the third quarter than in the second quarter. It is important to note that this is higher than our forecast, but the difference is primarily timing as we had anticipated this revenue in the fourth quarter. Second, we had $15 million of positive adjustments from reconciliations from our Special Needs Plans in the quarter. These revenue increases were offset by approximately $10 million of higher costs. Because of the concentration of the shared savings revenue in Q3, we are forecasting a decline in IKC operating results in Q4 compared to Q3. As we have said in the past, results in the IKC business are likely to be somewhat volatile from one quarter to the next. So focusing on annual results remains the better way to understand our performance. Our IKC business continues to make progress and we now expect a full year 2023 IKC adjusted operating loss of approximately $110 million, which is slightly ahead of our prior 2023 guidance. Turning to Q4, our updated operating income guidance implies fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $380 million, a sequential decline of approximately $145 million. The vast majority of the delta is due to two factors, IKC and seasonality. In IKC, fourth quarter results will be lower due primarily to timing as previously noted. The fourth quarter will also have typical seasonality driven by several factors including higher mistreatment rates around the holidays, higher spend on health benefits for our teammates, increased G&A and other year-end costs in the fourth quarter. The magnitude of this seasonality is higher than what we would normally see in the fourth quarter this year. We closed or consolidated 15 clinics in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date number to 51. We will continue to evaluate our footprint in light of utilization trends. On taxes, we now expect our full year 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23% to 24% which is below our previous range for the year. The updated range is reflective of larger benefits recognized for stock-based compensation and forecasted tax credits. Transitioning to the balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy remains focused on capital efficient growth. As we have said in the past, we target maintaining a low leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5x EBITDA over the long-term, and had paused our share repurchase program 1-year ago as part of our goal to return to this range. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares this past quarter, and we ended the quarter with a leverage ratio near the middle of our target range. As a result, and after considering our typical set of capital allocation principles, including our view of intrinsic value relative to current market price of our stock, we intend to resume purchasing shares this quarter. We expect to fund share repurchases using a combination of excess cash flow and capacity within our revolving credit facility. As a reminder, we upsized our revolver earlier this year to provide us with more liquidity and flexibility in our capital structure. We continue to manage our exposure to rising interest rates. Approximately half our debt is long-term notes with very attractive fixed rates, while the other half of our debt is floating rate, we have implemented interest rate caps to manage the majority of this exposure through the end of 2025. That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my questions. I guess a couple for me here. I guess on year-over-year patient care costs, you guys were some pretty big reductions sort of year-over-year and sequentially. You sort of talked about changes within looking to be managing. But can you just help us sort of think about sort of what were the drivers -- bridge those drivers to us? And then why not talking about 2024, you've done a pretty amazing job this year controlling costs, I guess, do you still see the same opportunity going into next year? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Thanks for the question, Pito. So if you think about patient care costs, I think the right way to think about it is continued wage rate -- wage rate pressure, which we are seeing. As you think about SWBs that is offset by the lower contract labor. Remember, last year, that was a big pain for us and we've got that under control relatively early in the year. So you're probably seeing the better part of $100 million, maybe a little bit less than that. But of that order of magnitude, in savings year-over-year. In terms of other items, we've done a nice job here controlling our anemia costs. We've talked about that in terms of the reduction from the switch to Mircera. And then you have additional savings from us consolidating our footprint, as a result of lower patient volumes. So those are the big items year-over-year. If you think about 2024, I think we anticipate continuing to see pressure on the wage rate, relative to a pre-COVID number. I don't think we are ready to give guidance on where that will land, but it's certainly not coming back to the pre-COVID level from what we see now. We would expect some continued savings, as the savings from both Mircera and our facility closings annualize. And then as you would expect, we will continue to look for other opportunities to bring the cost down to mitigate, what ultimately will be a higher wage rate pressure than we see in our RPT growth. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then shifting sort of to the GLP-1s, we sort of tried to do the same thing a few weeks ago, sort of building out a 10-year model. There's definitely a lot of moving parts here. Any chance you guys want to sort of share with us the model that you guys had just so we can play with the assumptions within those variables. And at the same time, can you just sort of talk to us about what you saw with HCL2 inhibitors, what impact did you guys see from CKD patients going to [indiscernible] disease from that drug and just as you think about the impact from GLP-1s? Javier Rodriguez : Well, Pito, this is Javier. And I saw your note. So you've been swimming and all the complexity here. So since there's different levels of familiarity and understanding on the call, and as you know, the variables have interplay with one another. I think it would be good to step back, get a common foundation, so that we can all take off from the same place. So to get that model, that you asked for, what I'm going to ask is, first, for our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Gillian to provide a high-level overview of the Clinical. And then I'll hand it over to Joe, and he can give us a bit of the financial impact, so we could give you a framework, and then we can talk about assumptions. Is that fair? Pito Chickering : Sounds good. Javier Rodriguez : All right. Dr. G. Jeffrey Giullian : Yes. Perfect. Thanks, Pito. Let me just start by saying, I acknowledge the energy and society right now, all around these medications. And as Javier mentioned at the outset, I'm encouraged, I think we are all encouraged that these drugs can truly change the lives of many people, and we certainly endorse the use of therapies that benefit people living with heart disease and those living with kidney disease. When it comes to the GLP-1 agonist, they've been available since 2005. They've generated dozens of high-quality clinical studies. And what I found interesting is that really fewer than half of the studies that even looked at kidney disease, demonstrated any efficacy and delaying progression. So that's about 40% of those studies showed no improvement. 40% showed some aspects of improvement and then about 20% had some mixed results. And then, of course, of those that demonstrated, that improvement or the impact, the greatest impact was on a subset of patients. And so that's where we started with all of this. Now like you're probably wondering, I think the two biggest questions I get are : a, what percent of people are ultimately or do we ultimately expect are going to be on these medications? And then b, what percent delay in progression of CKD is that going to lead to? So let me kind of walk you through our clinical thinking, and then I'll hand it off to Joel to talk more about the financial impact. On that first question about 5% to 8% of patients right now with CKD are on these medications. And the published discontinuation rates is high as 69%. And to be very conservative in our model, we've ultimately estimated that about 30% of CKD patients could someday take these medications, and we arrived at that number by triangulating from a number of different data points. We looked at uptake of other medications, including generic medications, which are known to slow kidney dysfunction. We looked at patient clinical eligibility. And specifically on that one, about 70% of CKD patients, who ultimately progress to dialysis, are either obese or have diabetes or both with the other 30% really not being eligible for these drugs. And so we were assuming about 40% of those that are eligible could potentially receive these medications in the future. And then that would translate to at maximum, we believe, around 30% of the total CKD patient population, who would be on these medicines of those that ultimately progress to dialysis. So that's the first part of the question. The second part of the question is how to estimate impact. And we did that by looking at things, that we know of, in terms of evaluating slowing disease progression. And that is if there is even a delay with these medicines. Right now, we are estimating a 25% delay in progression. And to arrive at that number, we looked at the impact in the subset of clinical trials that did demonstrate renal progression efficacy. And as I had mentioned, that's about 40% of those studies. And then we picked the data points from those of the smaller subpopulations in those studies, where the medications demonstrated benefit. And so in general, that appeared to be about 25%, and we use that 25% to really extrapolate for the broader CKD population. And again, this was to be conservative in our approach. And I'll just sort of end by saying no therapy has really demonstrated the halt progression or reversal of kidney damage over time. And -- so that goes to the second part of your question, which includes the SGLT2s. Right now about 8% of our ESRD population has been on an SGLT2 and that's for a number of reasons, including the fact that about 65% of patients that get prescribed those medications ultimately discontinue them. So that impact, we believe we have considered already in our model, and I'll let Joel share a little bit more on that. Javier Rodriguez : Great. Thank you, Dr. Giullian. So I have had the benefit of weeks and weeks of being steeped in the clinical aspects of this with Dr. Giullian, other nephrologists, epidemiologists, both internal as well as external. So let me try and sum up what Dr. Giullian said and then I'll talk about our modeling. I would say three things. First, our assumptions are not pulled out of the air. These GLP-1 drugs have been used for at least 7 or 8 years for the management of diabetes. So there are a number of robust studies, as Jeff said. So there is a data set off of which to build some assumptions. That said, there's a lot of uncertainty still, and we wanted to be conservative. So we landed on two assumptions that are incorporated in our modeling. First, that 30% of the CKD population will be on these drugs. It's not going to happen overnight. It will play out over time. That's one of the things that makes the modeling complex. So that's assumption one, a 30% utilization rate or penetration rate among our population. Again, we think that is a conservative number. Second, a 25% efficacy rate. And what that means is for the patients, who take this drug, their progression in CKD will be slowed down by 25%. To put numbers on that, if you think of a typical CKD patient progressing from a later stage of CKD to ESRD over 10 years, that would convert that 10-year progression to 12.5 years. So those are the clinical inputs that we are using for our modeling. Now let me turn to how we modeled two different numbers. The first, I'm going to talk about is, commercial mix impact. And let me start with this because I think it's a little bit easier to understand and the financial implications could be serious. But what you'll hear is they are not and here's why. So as you would expect, we've got a very robust model around this, that we've used to simulate the impact in a number of scenarios. We use this also to create a much simplified framework, that we can use to explain to you how we are thinking about this. So let me start that framework with some known inputs. First, we have approximately 22,000 commercial patients today that we know. And second, again, most of our patients, who are 65 and over are on -- are not commercially insured. For modeling purposes, it is safe to assume that the population above 65 has a commercial mix of almost 0. And for the commercial mix of our incident patients below 65, it is pretty constant. It doesn't matter if they're 40 or 50 or 60, it's a pretty constant number and the number drops, when they hit 65. The result of that shape of the curve is that when we think about modeling the impact of a delay in progression from GLP-1s on commercial mix, all that really matters is the cohort of patients, who are just below the age of 65, who without GLP-1s would have been incident to dialysis with commercial insurance, but because of GLP-1s, their incidents will be delayed. And instead of being delayed at younger than 65, instead of being incident at younger than 65, they will be incident at older than 65. So with that framework, let me tell you our assumptions. First, we are talking about a 25% delay in progression. We talked about that already. That translates, as I said, into a 2.5-year window of incident patients that we care about. And here's an important fact. About 10% of our commercial population is incident in that 2.5-year window, before 65. Said another way, 10% of our commercial population is aged 62.5 through 64. And so here's the math. You take 22,000 patients assume 10% of them are in that incident window that we care about of 62.5 to 64 and say 30% of them will be on the GLP-1 drug, and that gets you 22,000 x 10% x 30%, that's 660 patients. That's the number of commercial patients, we would expect to lose, as a result of GLP-1 penetration getting to 30%. That 660 patients divided by our 200,000 patients is 33 basis points of commercial mix. So again, let me be clear what that 33 basis points of commercial mix means. It means the cumulative impact of the growth of GLP-1s, however, long it takes us to get to that 30% and to see that flow through our CKD population, will be a reduction of 33 basis points in total. If that happens over 10 years, that's about 3 basis points a year. It is a negligible amount. To put it in perspective, our commercial mix went up 18 basis points this quarter alone, you would never find this in our numbers. That's why we believe the commercial mix effectively will not change as a result of a delay in progression. Joel Ackerman : All right. Pito, we said a mouthful just to set it up, there's, of course, the second part, which is just an overall volume, but we wanted to start off with commercial patients first and the impact on that, which is, as Joel said, not financially important. So any questions on that? Pito Chickering : So to sort of take all that and sort of reapply the models, but that was a very detailed answer. I will jump back in the queue for some more questions in a bit. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. I appreciate all that detail. That was incredible. So let me just follow-up on one of those points, which is that 30%. So the 30% in a CKD population, that knows they're progressing to ESRD and dialysis. Is there -- what's the kind of grounding behind that number? I thought it might be higher, given the end state of kidney [indiscernible] Jeffrey Giullian : Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Jeff Giullian. We've looked at a number of things. We know for the past two decades or longer that we've had generic medications, ACE inhibitors and ARBs on the market, that have good impact on potentially slowing progression of renal disease. When you look at the uptake of those medications, even in patients who you just described, know that they're progressing through CKD, even that ranges between only 17.8% and about 30% to 35% of the population. And those medications tend to have a slightly lower discontinuation rate than the GLP-1s. And so looking at that, we have a pretty strong baseline of what to expect for uptake of these medications. Javier Rodriguez : And remember, Justin, it's better to think of it as 40% because 30% are neither diabetic nor obese. And so it's 30% overall, but 40% of the applicable population. And we are assuming a 100% adherence which is not a normal assumption. We are just trying to be as conservative, as we can be because, as Dr. G said, many, many people get off the medicine actually more than 50% after year 1 is a stat, that's useful. Justin Lake : And then, Doc, can you tell us why that number is so low, again, among people that are kind of marching towards kidney failure. Why is the take up rate only 18% to 30%? Could you -- do not think that goes higher given the some of these studies that are coming out that are highlighting the benefits? Or are those benefits always been known and the magnitude of those benefits always been known. And there are reasons why it's still so low. Jeffrey Giullian : Yes. It takes a lot of speculation to understand why patients do or don't do what they ultimately choose. Some of this has to do with access to physicians and access to medications and social determinants of health. Some of it has to do with discontinuation rates for any number of reasons, such as side effects and things along those lines. And quite frankly, our clinical research team has done research in the population of patients that ultimately progresses from CKD to end-stage renal disease. And there's just a number of social and other reasons, including behavioral health, education, et cetera, that limits the full uptake like we might expect on paper. Justin Lake : Got it. Appreciate it. And then just two quick numbers questions, I'll jump out. The first, can you tell us your run rate, in terms of patient care costs that are now coming from drugs? Just trying to understand the totality of where drug spending is at the moment? And then secondly, Joel, if we look back, it's exciting to hear you're kind of going to get back to buying back the stock. I think the last time you were buying it in 2022, I think you averaged around $200 million a quarter. Could investors think about that as a reasonable kind of jumping point, in terms of what -- how to think about you kind of pace of buybacks? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Let me take the buyback one first. In terms of pace, it is hard to put a number out there, I'd say, look, we've always been comfortable using excess cash flow as well as available leverage to buy back. What I would point out is, we have a bigger revolver than we've had historically. We used to have a $1 billion revolver. We upsized that to $1.5 billion. So if you think about the limitation of liquidity on our share buybacks, we would probably be more comfortable tapping into the revolver for buybacks now, now that we've got a bigger revolver than we did before. Justin Lake : And the second part of the question was what percentage or what's the cost of treatment on drugs? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I assume what you're really interested is in anemia there, that's been the source of the biggest savings. That number has come down dramatically to a point, where I think it's hard to bake in a lot of major savings from that going forward. Justin Lake : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Maybe just to circle back to buyback comment. Is it safe to say that the $3 million to $3.5 million is still the gating factor then to that? Or now that you feel more comfortable about your base EBITDA, the ability to grow that you'd be okay over some period of time going above the $3.5 million that you would get back to that $3 million to $3.5 million? Joel Ackerman : Yes, Kevin, I wouldn't view it as a gating factor, but rather we committed to getting back to that place. And now we are there, and we feel comfortable being there. And we will revert back and forth as we see appropriate. Right now, we see a disconnect between how we are feeling about our business and how the market is interpreting our results. And so we might be very aggressive. And so that is, of course, term of art because if I use that and I buy $300 million, you're going to think it was $400 million. And so I would say, from my perspective, the right way to think about it is, we want to give our money back to our shareholders, and we want to be capital efficient, and we want to pounce if there's an opportunity or a window, and that's probably the best way to think about it. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, one of the things as you walk through your model about -- you talked about the slowdown in progression of the disease. You kind of started with like an advanced CKD population. Is there any potential that taking the drug earlier would start that clock earlier than that and extend the 25% slowdown? Or is this really something that really does just kind of kick in, they're all going to happen later on in that 10-year window is when the clock starts. And I think at the beginning, you talked about how you all see a volume impact for, whatever it was, 15 years or so. But then you start talking about how the drug has been used in the last 7 years. So trying to figure out when does the clock start on that volume impact? Jeffrey Giullian : Sure. Thanks, Kevin. This is Jeff Giullian again. A couple of things. Number one, for chronic kidney disease in general, the time frame can be variable, but from moving from early CKD Stage 3, all the way to end-stage kidney disease, is often 15 to 20 years. I think the average is about 18 years. Even for people living with diabetes, that time frame is 11, 12 years or even longer in some cases. Kevin Fischbeck : Sorry, let me correct you said 3. You meant to say pre from \u2026 Jeffrey Giullian : Yes, exactly. Thank you. And so as we look at this and have modeled it out and have thought about it, we don't believe that we are going to see a major impact in the next 10 years. Then to take that one step further, as we've looked at the clinical studies, even the subset of clinical studies that have demonstrated any kidney impact at all, that impact is significantly lower in the patient population that is pre-CKD Stage 3. Joel Ackerman : Kevin, it's Joel here. Let me add one more point because we are probably not talking enough about the potential offset from a reduction in cardiac mortality. And that plays into this question of what impact are we seeing and when are we seeing it? And I think one of the reasons we are seeing -- we think we are seeing so little impact now is because the uptake in the drug has been so low. Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, but GLP-1 uptake in CKD is low single digits today, right? So you wouldn't expect to see it at such a low uptake. The other important thing is both for GLP-1s and for SGLT2 inhibitors, there has been clear demonstration of a reduction in cardiac mortality. And the way we think about that playing through our population, is so many more CKD patients are likely to die of cardiac disease, than ultimately progress to ESKD. So if you can reduce that number, who are passing away from cardiac disease, it creates a larger population that could potentially, ultimately be incident on ESRD, and that would offset some of the impact of incident delay. And so if we are seeing the negative impact of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1s today, even though the uptake of those drugs is so small, there is a good chance that we are also seeing the mitigating effect on the cardiac death. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That's helpful. I guess maybe then a question would be in the quarter, you talked about mortality improving. Are the new starts back to where you would expect them to be? Or does that also have to improve? Joel Ackerman : Our new starts are back to where we would have expected them to be. We felt that pressure intensely last year, but we are now seeing year-over-year starts back to what we would have expected. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. So you're looking at it and saying 2% volume growth is the right number. Longer term, the new starts back to where it should be, it's really just the mortality that's the difference between where we are now at 2%? Joel Ackerman : I think that\u2019s a reasonable summation of where we are. Jeffrey Giullian : Yes. If you were to be a little more refined or sharpen your pencil, our miss treatments are slightly higher than before, and we are working on that as well. But your point is bigger. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And so then this comment that you're making about, if this drug is adopted and the cardiology benefit is the way you think it could be, would we see more new starts then? Is that what would show up, you see that before we saw the progression? Or how does that -- how would we ever see that -- that's actually the way that that's playing out? Joel Ackerman : Well, I think, yes, you would see it in new starts. I mean you'd never be able to pinpoint these patients, but these are patients who, without these drugs would have passed away at late-stage CKD before being incident to ESRD, but that, again, would be offset by the delay in incidence of patients who are taking these drugs and remain in CKD longer. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Makes sense. And then maybe just last question. The IKC business coming in better, but you're still kind of keeping that 2026 target, is there anything unusual or prior period in that? Or is it just not a big enough change from your projection to kind of say that the trajectory is accelerated? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So look, the quarter was really strong, but a lot of that was the result of timing. It was shared savings revenue that we expected in Q4 and came in Q3. As we've talked about in the past and we think will be true in the future, the quarter-over-quarter variability in IKC is quite large. And I think the right way to look at IKC is full year, what we see now, we called out $110 million loss approximately for IKC for the year. That's a bit better than what we were talking about before. But nowhere nearly, as big as the beat this quarter. And again, that's largely because of the timing between this quarter and next. So I'd say overall, IKC is on track. They are performing slightly better than we expected, but in the range. And for that reason, we continue to expect better number next year, again in '25 and then breakeven by '26. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Clive : Hi. Thanks very much. And talking about the late-stage CKD patients, how should we think about the diagnosis of that group? Obviously, even Stage 3 is severely under diagnosed and there's been a big push to try and improve that. Now that there are a variety of medications, that can really potentially have an impact, if used early enough, it seems like it's the right thing to do by patients. How are you involved in this? And where do you see the diagnosis rates going? Jeffrey Giullian : Thanks, Lisa. This is Jeff again. A couple of thoughts on that. There's been a push to diagnose patients earlier with CKD for a long time, and yet, we are not seeing epidemiologically a large increase in that. There's been a push to get the word out about kidney disease and things along those lines. When it comes to the medications available, medications like ACE inhibitors and ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors and the GLP-1s, they've been available for a long time, and the knowledge regarding their kidney impacts have been known to the nephrology community for several years. So for us, this isn't necessarily new news, although I know it's been making headlines recently. So from that standpoint, we are not seeing a lot of change. We are continuing to work with physicians upstream to educate them about medications that are available and things like that. And as we think specifically about our role in Integrated Kidney Care and improving transitions of care for those patients that do go on to dialysis, this is something that's important to us. We work with our physician partners regularly on managing the care of patients with chronic kidney disease and reducing their risk factors. Lisa Clive : Okay. And a related question, just looking at the disease prevalence over time. As we've seen the obesity rate go over the last 20 years from sort of 30% to 40% of the adult population, Clearly, we've seen a notable increase in diabetes and [indiscernible] and depth, but at least the estimated prevalence and it's a big estimate because there are so many undiagnosed patients. But the estimated prevalence of CKD, has really been pretty flat over that time period. Any thoughts on why that may be the case? I'm just thinking if that obesity rate even potentially pulls back, what the relationship will be with CKD? Jeffrey Giullian : Yes. Most of the estimated prevalence comes from physicians coding CKD, as a diagnosis, through what's called ICD-10 codes. And so as physicians focus on other things, cardiovascular risk factors and cancer type risk factors and things like that. CKD in the early stages, especially CKD 1 and 2 and early CKD Stage 3, just isn't top of priority in some cases. And so we are just not seeing at least the documented prevalence of those with CKD Stage 3 rise. Lisa Clive : Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys. So I'll follow-up here with a couple sort of just quickies here. SG&A, a lot of moving parts this quarter, including, I think, a funding of charity groups. Just curious, if you can just bridge us for what the moving parts in 3Q? And how we should think about G&A for 4Q? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I don't think there's a lot to call out on G&A overall quarter-over-quarter, there's really nothing that jumps out. In terms of Q4, I would expect a modest uptick from seasonality, but nothing major. Pito Chickering : Okay. Revenue per treatment had a nice pickup sequentially as well. Was there any mix shift here? Or is that just more of a seasonality thing at this point? Joel Ackerman : Yes. The biggest impact on RPT quarter-over-quarter was continued progress on our collections efforts. We are really crowd from an operational standpoint of what our team has been able to accomplish there. We talked about it last quarter. We got a little bit more this quarter. And I would say, for the time being, we've probably gotten the vast majority of that. So I'm not anticipating a whole lot more of that in the next few quarters. We did see a commercial mix uptick in the quarter but, we also got the benefit of some just negotiated rate increases as well. Pito Chickering : What are the goals that you're getting at this point from commercial payers? Joel Ackerman : Sorry, what was the question? Pito Chickering : What are the -- I guess, the rate increases that managed care payers are giving at this point? Joel Ackerman : As we've said in the past, our contracts are multiyear. So in any given year, you don't have that many at that. What we've seen up to now, is a lot of regional accounts and it's fair to say that the increases have reflected the environment that we're in, i.e., an inflationary environment. So they've been a bit higher than pre-pandemic. And we will see what next year brings as we have a couple of the larger ones up for renewal. Pito Chickering : Okay. On IKC, I guess things got a little bit worse there for the year. I guess, what was driving that, if I heard that right. And then you talked about start of 2024 OI in the 4% to 7% range, how much of that is coming from improvements of IKC versus from kidney? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So, Pito, I think you misheard there. IKC has gotten a little bit better. We have lowered the loss since our prior guidance. So we continue to see improvement over the course of the year. In terms of '24, it's too early to give guidance. Javier talked about 3% to 7% as being where we think the midpoint of the range will fall. Again, too early to quantify where that will come from, I'd say, it's fair to say some of it will come from IKC, but that will not be all good. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then last question for me, just a follow-up on Kevin's question, specifically on third quarter. What were the new patient adds in the third quarter? How does that compare versus where we were pre-COVID? And specifically, what was the mortality in the quarter, how did that compare versus sort of pre-COVID. Just curious the interplay between incidents of new patients versus extension of mortality to help figure out treatment growth. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So, for the quarter, volume came in right where we expected it. The new adds were consistent with kind of a pre-COVID type number, excess mortality, I'm going to peg it at 400. I think the excess mortality number is a number that we are probably going to start phasing out as a metric. It's getting so close to pre-COVID levels, it's getting kind of within the error band of what you consider as our pre-COVID number, and that number moved year-to-year pre-COVID. So for consistency with what we've called out historically, the number is 400. But I think I would expect that number to continue to decline and ultimately, like contract labor, it was something that was important for a period of time but is no longer important. So we are going to try and move away from that number going forward. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me guys. Thanks so much. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Pito. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Clive : Hi. I just wanted to squeeze in some questions on home dialysis, if I can. Do you have any statistics you could give us about what proportion of your incident private patients are still employed versus on COBRA and how that looks, if there's any difference in your home dialysis patients and how we should think about that mix going forward? Javier Rodriguez : I actually don't know the mix between COBRA and private, but I know that number is pretty steady and when there's full employment, that usually moves in recessionary periods. So we can look at that, but I don't think it's a meaningful change, if that's what you're going for. And as it relates to home, it does have a higher mix. We have now roughly 15% change of our patients at home, and that number has been stable. We've continued to work hard to get more patients on it. But we have not seen any shift in insurance as it relates to the cohorts. Lisa Clive : Okay. I guess I was really just wondering for those private patients that managed to go on home dialysis, whether there is more of a -- whether more of them can stay employed because my understanding was for the patients that are on COBRA, a lot of them won't make it through the full sort 33 months. Could you just comment on whether I'm right on that and whether that -- whether greater home dialysis could mean sort of more patients employed for longer? Joel Ackerman : Yes. We've looked at that number, and it's not an easy piece of analysis because you can run into the trap of correlation without causation and you wind up with a number that looks good, but ultimately doesn't really drive any better financial results as your home dialysis rates go up. So I would put that down as inconclusive. Javier Rodriguez : And Lisa, one of the things that is important for the last decade or so, people assume that patient would go home, they would have more flexibility and they would keep their ability to work. But the reality is that the dropout rate on dialysis at home has continued to be incredibly high. So roughly about half of the patients that are on therapy would rather be taking care in center or have to be taken in center because of a medical condition. Lisa Clive : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : And we have no additional questions in the queue. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well, I know that, that was a very dense conversation, unusual in that it was not so much related into the quarter, but something that is really important to have an understanding of what we are looking at and what you're looking at. So let me make a couple of closing comments. First, we had a very strong quarter, and we continue our track record of meeting our commitments. Secondly, hopefully, it became clear. We are very happy that these drugs are out there and it can improve the lives of many. But on kidney, it is more nuanced to understand the impact it will have on the population. Third, even with a robust adoption, based on what we know today, we believe that this class of drugs will not impact our plan to deliver a 3% to 7% OI growth for our long-term plan. And then lastly, but really important, we remain really diligently and focused on delivering the best care today for our patients while also building the capabilities and models of care for a healthier tomorrow. It just dawned on me that this is the last time that we're scheduled to speak for the year. So on behalf of our team, I'd like to wish you and your families a happy and healthy holidays. Be well.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Nic, and thank you all for joining the call today. As we reflect on the past year, our 2023 financial performance highlighted the resilience of our business and revealed some of the early benefits of our multi-year investment in strengthening our platform. External challenges of the past few years ultimately made us stronger, and with continued investment in our teammates, systems and capabilities, we believe that we're well-positioned for the years ahead. We began 2024 with great momentum and a reduction in the risks and uncertainties that characterize the recent years. Today, I will cover our 2023 results and our 2024 guidance, provide an annual update on integrated kidney care and briefly continue our discussion on GLP-1 drugs. First, however, I'll begin the call as we always do with the clinical highlights. More than 20 years, we have strived to be a community-first and a company-second. This means that we're committed not only to providing outstanding care, but also to give back. In 2023, our teammates logged over 42,000 hours of service to their communities, which marks our highest year ever in a step toward achieving our cumulative goal of 125,000 hours by 2025. And some of our special teammates donated their personal time to advance our goal of raising awareness for kidney disease. We recently wrapped our 2023 Health Tour, a mobile health screening and kidney care education program supporting local communities across the country. Today, 15% of our US population has kidney disease, which often goes undiagnosed and untreated until symptoms become severe. Our mobile health tour was designed to help identify risk factors that may lead to chronic kidney disease, including screening for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and family history of kidney disease. For two months on the road, our bus travelled 17,000 miles to offer free screenings in 48 communities across eight states. To power this tour, more than 300 of our teammates volunteered 1,200 hours in service to their local communities. This effort is a wonderful example of combining our dedication to service with our ongoing commitment to raising awareness for early detection and prevention of kidney disease. Transitioning to our performance. Full year 2023 adjusted operating income, adjusted EPS and free cash flow, all came in well-above our guidance from the beginning of the year. As context, I think it's helpful to reflect back on our progress over the year. We began 2023 in an uncertain environment and shared the assumptions in our guidance that volume and labor challenges would continue throughout 2023. We're simultaneously developing and executing on a number of initiatives focused on offsetting some of those financial headwinds we were facing. As the year progressed, we saw encouraging data points early in the year, which ultimately turned into consistent positive trends. These improved trends, combined with the strong operating performance and the positive impact on the initiatives we implemented, resulted in a 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income, 28% growth in adjusted EPS and a return of our leverage ratio back to the target range. I'll share three points for additional color. First, on volume. We entered 2023 with a 2% growth headwind due to the annualization of excess mortality from prior year. Since then, successive COVID surges have been weaker in magnitude with lower mortality. At the same time, we are able to produce four consecutive quarters with year-over-year growth in new patient admits. Adding these factors together, 2023 saw increased patient census for the first time since COVID started and volume that was approximately flat year-over-year, landing at the top of our guidance range. Second, our labor performance in 2023 was better than 2022. We cut our reliance on contract labor more quickly than anticipated and improved staffing in our centers. On the other side of the ledger, teammate turnover has remained elevated in line with the strong healthcare labor markets. Looking forward, improved retention and training costs represent an opportunity for improvement in the years ahead. Third, independent of these trends, we drove strong operating performance through our differentiated platform and capabilities. Most notably, we invested in our revenue operations to achieve sustainable improvements in our collections. This resulted in an additional $3.50 in revenue per treatment for the full year while reducing more than 12 days from our US day sales outstanding. Adding to this, we executed against our cost saving initiatives related to pharmaceutical spend and further consolidated our facility footprint. Finally, we exceeded our annual profitability targets for integrated kidney care, which I will cover more in detail in a moment. To summarize, we entered 2024 with more visibility and confidence that we have had since the start of COVID in 2020. Our ability to invest in our people, process and systems, despite the operational and financial challenges of the last few years, has positioned us well for the years ahead. On that note, let me transition to our value-based care business, which we will call integrated kidney care, or IKC. We have consistently urged our investors to assess this business on an annual basis rather than focusing on our quarterly results. Now is a good time to pause and reflect on our performance and outlook of IKC. At a high level, we assess IKC performance based on three primary metrics : one, total medical expense and patients in our IKC programs, which represents growth; two, our clinical performance or effectiveness of reducing total medical costs; and three, per member per month spend on our model of care and G&A, which indicates cost management. I'll walk through each in a bit more detail. First, total medical expense of patients in our IKC programs grew to $4.6 billion, reflecting approximately 30% growth year-over-year. This represents care for 58,000 patients as of year-end, a 38% increase from 2022. Within our traditional value-based care programs, we continue to be disciplined, prioritizing profitable growth. For 2024, we expect growth in excess of 25% for total medical expense and covered lives. Second, our model of care has proven effective in helping our patients lead healthier lives and reducing medical costs, reflecting in a net savings rate that is slightly ahead of our expectations. Largest driver is year-over-year reduction in hospitalizations, especially readmission rates. This relies on our collaboration efforts between our care teams and physician partners to prevent rising acuity and address the needs of our most complex and vulnerable patients. And finally, our per member per month cost continue to trend down as a result of the program growth and improved fixed cost leverage. In 2023, our per member per month cost declined by 7%. We expect per member per month cost to further decline by approximately 15% in 2024. The result of these efforts is that we outperformed our 2023 adjusted operating loss forecast, and we believe we remain on track to deliver breakeven or better performance by 2026. Beyond the core metrics, we can further break down our performance based on three primary components of our IKC business : special need plans, our value-based care portfolio focused primarily on Medicare Advantage patients, and the CKCC demonstration project for our Medicare fee-for-service patients. Within that portfolio, after many years of investment and consistent year-over-year improvements in cost savings, our MA contracts and special need plans have now reached profitability. Keep in mind that the third component, CKCC, represents approximately 50% of our value-based care census. We adjust the changes from CMS and further optimize our model of care, we expect this program to become profitable in 2026 timeframe. Before we get into 2024, I'll offer a quick comment on GLP-1. To be clear, none of our thinking has changed since our last earnings call. Shortly after our call, results for the select clinical trial were released. As expected, the trial confirms certain cardiovascular benefits in people with obesity and cardiovascular disease, including a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality. Next on the near-term horizon will be the FLOW study, which we anticipate will demonstrate efficacy on multiple endpoints, including slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. As a reminder, such efficacy that may be demonstrated in the FLOW study is already incorporated into our GLP-1 base case, [reflects] (ph) a net neutral impact to dialysis volume growth as adoption ramps up over the next decade. Shifting to 2024, we're setting guidance for adjusted operating income growth of 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%, reflecting the midpoint of our respective guidance range for each metric. This incorporates our expectations of a more predictable operating environment, continued returns from our revenue cycle investment and further progress in IKC. This guidance demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability, despite external challenges, to provide high-quality care while delivering strong financial results. Let me touch on a few drivers of our forecast. First, 2024 adjusted operating income will benefit from the full year impact of positive development in 2023, including the annualization of revenue cycle improvement, our transition to Mircera and savings related to our center consolidation. Second, as noted, we're demonstrating progress in our IKC business and continue to expect breakeven by 2026. And finally, adjusted earnings per share will benefit from our share repurchase program, offset by other factors below the OI line, including other losses, higher interest expense and higher effective tax rate. As we turn the page to 2024, we have a great opportunity to drive operating advancements that further differentiate DaVita within kidney care. I'll now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks, Javier. In Q4, we delivered $415 million of adjusted operating income and $1.87 of adjusted earnings per share. Our strong performance for the quarter puts us just above the top end of our updated full year guidance range from the Q3 call. Our outperformance in the quarter relative to our expectations was primarily related to prior period development in our special needs programs in our IKC business, plus revenue per treatment growth from continued improvements in our revenue cycle management. In the US dialysis segment, fourth quarter treatments per day were flat versus the third quarter. As a reminder, mistreatment rates are seasonally higher in the winter months, which was offset by an improvement in our day of week mix relative to the third quarter. Revenue per treatment was up approximately $6 quarter-over-quarter. About half of this was due to normal quarterly fluctuations. The remaining increase was driven equally by continued improvements in our revenue cycle management and typical fourth quarter seasonality related to higher acute mix and reimbursement for flu vaccines. Adjusted patient care cost per treatment was up $13 sequentially, driven primarily by seasonality, including higher benefits expense and continued investment in our teammates. This sequential increase was higher than typical for Q4, but in line with our expectations described on our Q3 earnings call. In our IKC business, adjusted operating results were down $39 million sequentially, due primarily to timing of shared services revenue recognized in Q3 primarily from arrangements from 2022. Additionally, in Q4, we recognized incremental shared savings revenue of $55 million associated with Medicare Advantage value-based care arrangements for plan year 2023. This is earlier than we had previously anticipated recognizing revenue for 2023 arrangements and is the result of the clearing of several revenue recognition hurdles earlier than otherwise anticipated. This revenue would have otherwise been recorded in 2024. As a result, we now anticipate that our recognition of shared savings revenue for our Medicare Advantage contracts in 2024 and beyond will generally align with the plan year in which they are earned, although there will likely continue to be updates in our estimates during each planned year and beyond until final reconciliation. This $55 million shared savings revenue recognized in 2023 has been excluded from our adjusted operating income as it represents earnings incremental to what would have been expected in 2023 absent the change. International adjusted operating income was down $18 million quarter-over-quarter. The largest component of this sequential change was driven by an increase in bad debt reserves. Transitioning to capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares, and since the start of 2024, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares. We ended 2023 with zero balance on our revolving credit facility and our leverage ratio declined slightly to 3.15 times consolidated EBITDA, below the midpoint of our target leverage range. The strong free cash flow was partly the result of continued reduction of our US dialysis DSOs, which ended the quarter at 54 days, down three days from last quarter and 12 days below the level at the end of 2022. Turning now to detail on 2024 guidance. Our adjusted operating income guidance for the year is $1.825 billion to $1.975 billion, representing 9.6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This is above our long-term expectation of 3% to 7% growth in adjusted operating income, driven by higher revenue per treatment growth in typical as a result of our investments in our revenue cycle management and cost savings in our non-labor patient care costs due to annualization of Mircera and footprint-related cost savings. To give you more detail, let me first cover the three main drivers of US dialysis growth versus 2023. First, we expect treatment volume growth of 1% to 2%. This is the result of continued new patient admissions growth on par with pre-pandemic averages, partially offset by mortality that is expected to remain slightly higher than pre-COVID levels. Second, we anticipate revenue per treatment growth of 2.5% to 3%. Approximately two-thirds of this growth is due to rate increases. The remaining third of the expected increase is primarily from annualization of the revenue cycle management improvements we saw in 2023. Third, we expect adjusted patient care cost per treatment to increase 2.5% to 3%. We continue to expect wages to increase at rates above pre-COVID levels. Savings to offset this include leverage of fixed costs as treatment volume grows and annualization of cost savings initiatives in 2023, including our conversion to Mercera for anemia management and our center consolidation efforts. Let me mention a couple of other items to help your thinking with US dialysis. We expect adjusted depreciation and amortization to decline by approximately $10 million to $15 million, a marked change from historical increases of approximately $20 million annually. This is the delayed result of our consistent effort over many years to increase our capital efficiency. As it relates to policy matters, we do not expect to spend the $50 million to $60 million related to ballot measures that would have been typical of past election years. For IKC, our guidance assumes an adjusted operating income loss of approximately $50 million. This reflects our expectation of continued growth in total medical spend and covered lives within our IKC programs, improved shared savings performance, and further fixed cost leverage, as outlined in Javier's earlier comments. In our international business, we incorporated in our guidance continued growth in adjusted operating income of approximately $20 million year-over-year. Below the OI line, we expect losses of approximately $60 million, largely as a result of our share of the losses in Mozarc, our co-investment with Medtronic in kidney products. We expect interest expense of $100 million to $110 million per quarter in the first half of the year, and $130 million to $140 million per quarter in the second half of the year. This increase is due to expiration of our 2% interest rate caps at midyear. We expect an adjusted effective income tax rate of 24% to 26%. For free cash flow, we expect $900 million to $1.15 billion, approximately 125% of adjusted net income. Consistent with our long-term capital strategy, we expect to deploy the vast majority of our free cash flow towards either capital-efficient growth when such opportunities exist or otherwise return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. We anticipate ending the year within our long-term target leverage ratio range of 3 times to 3.5 times. That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead, sir. Dean Rosales : Hi. This is Dean Rosales on for Justin. My question is on your Medicare risk businesses. Wondering what you're seeing there in terms of trend through 2023. And then specifically on special needs products, how many members do you have there exactly? And how much revenue is in those products? And could you speak to what you've seen in terms of costs year-to-date and then specifically Q4? Thank you very much. Javier Rodriguez : Thanks, Dean. So, what I'd highlight on the risk side of Medicare Advantage is, I think it's important to realize that the ESRD population is different than the broader MA population. And some of the trends you might be seeing with other payers, which we certainly watch very carefully, don't necessarily apply to our population. I'd highlight three things. First, the needs of these patients and the medical costs that they bear are very different than a population given the high acuity of these patients. So that's one. Second, I would also note the reimbursement for this population runs differently, and it's a separate reimbursement rate that comes out in both the preliminary and the final rule. And third, that the coding changes that apply to the broader MA population do not apply to the ESRD population. So, with that, I think it's early for us to really have a full view on what 2023 is. That said, we're feeling pretty good about where our net savings came in, both on the SNP side and on the Medicare Advantage population within our value-based care. In terms of just some of the cleanup, we have about 3,000 members in our SNP products. And in terms of revenue, it's somewhere north of $300 million. Dean Rosales : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche. You may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Looking at 2024 guidance, you're assuming a loss of $50 million in IKC. Can you refresh us what that was in 2023? And then in the script, I think you talked about 25% growth in revenues of IKC and a 15% reduction of PMPM. I would have assumed that would have shifted from a loss to gain in 2024 those metrics. So, if you can sort of help bridge that? And then, I think you're shifting from a cash accounting to an accrual accounting. That seems like a pretty big shift for you guys. I guess, what's giving us comfort that, that accrual makes sense at this point? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, a lot in there, Pito. Let me try and take this in the logical order. So, first, on revenue accounting, what -- historically, we did not record revenue until we were comfortable that we could reasonably estimate what our share of the shared savings would be. And that was true for both our MA population and our Medicare fee-for-service population, the CKCC program. The SNP product, we've always accounted for in -- I'll use your words, in an accrual method. The change we're talking about is about the change in the timing of when we get comfortable with those estimates. And you asked why. It's really three things. One is we've made some changes to the contractual language that gives us earlier clarity on attributed lives. So that's one. Second, we're getting our data earlier, which obviously helps us do some of the calculations earlier. And then third, just with the experience we've had, we've got better actuarial models. And putting those three things together, we're comfortable now that we can reasonably predict our share of the shared savings revenue, which ultimately turns into revenue in the plan year. So that's on the change in the estimates. In terms of -- you asked about 2023. So, we're guiding to a loss of $50 million for 2024. Our non-GAAP number for 2023 is a loss of $94 million. The thing to realize about that $94 million is it includes the revenue from the value-based care products from plan year '23, which is the result of this estimate change that I mentioned as well as the revenue from that product line for 2022. So, I think the way to think about 2023 to make it a little bit more apples-to-apples with '24 would be to back out somewhere around $25 million, maybe $30 million to make it a bit more apples-to-apples. And then, what was your other question? There was a PMPM question in there. Pito Chickering : So, you're taking a loss of $94 million after you back out the $25 million to $30 million. I think you guided to in the script sort of growth on IKC of 25%, and then a 15% reduction of PMPM in '24. So, I would assume that, that growth and those reductions would have resulted in a higher -- in operating income versus operating loss. So, kind of how can we sort of take those growth metrics and those cost reduction metrics and still get to a $50 million loss? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, a few things. First, just to clarify that estimate change I referred to only is true of the Medicare Advantage business. The CKCC business is still new enough that we're not comfortable estimating the savings in the plan year. So that part hasn't changed. In terms of your question, so the cost savings we're referring to is only related to our model of care in our G&A. It's not what you'd call the MLR in a health plan business. It's not that equivalent for us. Second, there are some -- there was a significant amount of positive period development in 2023, in particular in the SNP business that we're not forecasting to recur. So that would be another adjustment, which I think would help bridge the question of why aren't we getting to profitability next year or this year in '24. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then, on treatment growth, you're looking at the normalized growth in 4Q of 70 bps, you grew 50 bps in the third quarter. Is a key driver in fourth quarter new patients? Is it lower mortality? And also, when you close a center, those patients join another center, is that organic growth at the new center as old as the one as your discontinued ops, even though the patients don't actually change the numbers? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, no on the last one. If a patient moves from one clinic to another, it doesn't show up as any sort of growth anywhere. It's still our patient. In terms of the volume growth. I would point to Q4 over Q3 as effectively being flat, treatments per day were flat. And that's really a combination of a small census decline, which is not uncommon in Q4, offset by a better treatment mix day. So more Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, fewer Tuesdays, Thursdays. So, Q4 was really, I would call, a flat volume quarter-over-quarter. Pito Chickering : Great. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Joanna Gajuk : Hi. Good evening. Actually, this is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Actually, first question is just a follow-up on the volume discussion and it sounds like flattish sequentially, but I guess year-over-year, up less than 1%. And your guidance for '24 assumes 1% to 2% volume growth. So, kind of how do you build to that growth, especially to the higher end of 2%? What gives you confidence that, I guess, you could get to that volume growth for the year? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Thanks, Joanna. So, I'd start with the fact that the single biggest impact on volume year-over-year is census. And remember that census builds over the course of the year. So, if you look at the '23 growth, which was effectively flat, that was burdened by the fact that the census declined over the course of 2022 and only started building in '23. So, a lot of the zero in 2023 is the annualization of the negative impacts of 2022. As we think about '24, I'd really break it down into two components. First is new to dialysis admissions and we've watched that build over the course of 2023. And we feel comfortable that, that growth rate is back to pre-COVID levels. Where the reason we don't get back to what you'd call a 2% number pre-COVID or that would be the high end of the range is mortality continues to run higher than it did pre-COVID. It is way down off its COVID peak, but it's still running a bit higher than a typical pre-COVID year, remembering that mortality moved around in pre-COVID years, primarily as a result of the severity of the flu season. So, if you take a more normal new to dialysis admit outlook and then a slightly negative mortality outlook, that's how we get to the 1% to 2%. Joanna Gajuk : Thank you for that. And another follow-up on the guidance, I guess. You talked about your outlook for revenue per treatment. So specifically, can you talk about the build, I guess, for that? How much, I guess, is the commercial rate increases? And I guess last quarter, you mentioned there's some larger contracts up for renewal. So, any color in terms of these rate increases you're seeing there? And also inside that, your mix, commercial versus government, and then, specifically MA, where you stand on the MA mix? Javier Rodriguez : Great. Let me grab that, Joanna. A couple of things because I think underlying those questions, there's usually -- is there something unusual in the payer dynamics, and let me go ahead and start by no, we are in a normal period. And of course, we're trying to make sure that rates reflect the inflationary pressures that we are receiving. To you direct question on what percent of that -- what part made out of the rate, roughly two-thirds of the increase will be rate and one-third remaining. A good chunk of that is the annualization of the reimbursement operation improvements we saw in 2023 and the remaining is mix. As you have seen, our mix is trending on MA slightly above the market. So, our MA mix finished the quarter around 52%, and we expect that number to be a couple of points higher at the end of '24. So, somewhere in the 54%, 55% range, depending on open enrollment. Joanna Gajuk : And I guess on this commercial plan that you mentioned some larger plans up for renewal, any update there in terms of the rate increases you're seeing? Javier Rodriguez : Commercial, on the negotiations, we're not going to go into specifics. We continue to see that our commercial patients value their private insurance, and commercial mix is flattish. So, nothing to report on that. And of course, that's embedded in the guidance of the RPT that we gave you. Joanna Gajuk : Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Joanna. Operator : Thank you. A.J. Rice with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I can't let you get through the call without asking one GLP-1 question. So, in your prepared remarks, you're saying that for the FLOW study, you anticipate efficacy on multiple endpoints, including slowing CKD [progression] (ph). I think that's generally where the market is at. I wondered, given your analysis that you've offered and seems to have really gotten traction in the financial community, are there anything -- is there anything that could come out of the FLOW study at least in the high probability range that would make you revisit? It seems like you've covered most of what you expect in your analysis, but I wonder is it something that makes you more optimistic, less optimistic about how this will all impact your business? Javier Rodriguez : Thanks for the question, A.J. And as you know, last quarter, we had sort of a dissertation on GLP-1 that's gotten a lot of conversation. At the end of the day, we, of course, wanted to make sure that our shareholders and others were really well versed on it. And I think that while there could be an unusual surprise because you never want to say that the chances are zero, highly, highly improbable that we didn't capture in our range, what is likely to play out. And so that is -- that at the end of the day, we expect a net neutral impact on dialysis volume over the next decade. And we did a lot of probabilistic adjustments and weighted as to how many people would participate and all the normal math that we discussed, and we don't want to change our position a bit. A.J. Rice: Okay. Great. Maybe if I could pivot and ask you about your assumptions around labor going into '24. I know there's the underlying what you're banking on for wages and benefits for your permanent workers. I believe you still should have a tailwind from contract labor, at least annualizing where you're ending the year. And then, there's the whole issue of the California minimum wage for low wage healthcare workers. I know you said you wouldn't be spending for election spending, but I wonder what you're factoring in for that when you anticipate it to start to have an impact. Joel Ackerman : Yeah, A.J., thanks for that. So, for labor for the year, so we called out 2.5% to 3% of patient care cost growth per treatment. I'd break that down. That's roughly half labor and half other stuff. On the labor side, we're thinking something around 5% for the year in that and California would be baked into that. We called out a few months ago, something around $30 million to $40 million as the net impact of that once it's fully rolled out in a number of $20 million to $25 million for '24. We've been rolling it out a little bit quicker than we anticipated. So, I would expect the number will probably be somewhere in that $25 million to $30 million range, and that's baked into our number. The reason we're comfortable with the patient care cost being only 2.5% to 3%, given that half of it is labor, which is growing at 5%, is we've got savings from the annualization of both Mircera -- the ship to Mircera as well as some of the clinic footprint actions we took. We've also got fixed cost leverage as we add volume without adding centers. And a lot of those other costs are fixed costs that don't grow with volume and are under long-term contracts. So, we feel like despite a 5% wage pressure, we can get to that 2.5% to 3%. A.J. Rice: Okay, that's great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. You may go ahead, sir. Ryan Langston : Hi. This is Ryan Langston on for Gary this evening. I think Dean touched on it earlier, but maybe just to go back, how is the higher sort of Medicare Advantage trend we saw in the back half of the year impacting the accruals, I guess, not only for '23, but sort of your guidance for '24? And Joel, can you remind us when you anticipate to have the final reconciliation with your plan partners? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, the final reconciliation will depend. It's plan by plan. It can often take three or four quarters, and that will be -- ultimately be baked into prior period development in the IKC business. In terms of the impact of some of the costs on the broader MA population in Q4, again, we -- I think it's too early for us to say whether we think that's going to impact us. But again, I'd reiterate that our population is very different than the broader population. In terms of 2024, we're keeping a careful eye on it to see how it plays out, and it's built into our range. Ryan Langston : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Lisa Clive with Bernstein. You may go ahead. Lisa Clive : Hi. Just two questions for me. Number one, we're 18 months since the Marietta ruling, your commercial mix and pricing seems pretty stable. So just wanted to know if you have any thoughts on what that ruling has meant over the last few years and whether you're expecting any changes? And then also just a clarification in terms of the fact that you don't need to spend on ballot initiative and obviously, your wages are going up in California. So, it seems like a reasonable truce with the SEIU. Is this something that we should expect to continue, or is it really just this election cycle? Or it would be obviously nice for you guys to be out of this two-year cycle of fighting ballot initiatives? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : All right. Thank you, Lisa. So, let's start with Marietta. As we have discussed in the past, we have not seen a lot of employer groups change benefits, which is absolutely great. It would be terrible for employers to not give their employees that have end-stage renal disease choice. That said, we continue to be very mindful, and of course, work with the kidney community and disability groups, because it is sort of a dangerous risk out there that we want to make sure is not taken advantage of. And so, the analogy I say in a town hall when someone asks me if I have -- why I have so much passion on it, it's like saying the door in your house, the lock is broken. And you said, yes, but no one's broken in or very little. And you say, well, you still want to fix it. And so, from our perspective, it's something that the Supreme Court said. It needed to be clarified and the Champions and Congress and others believe it should be clarified. Now we just got to work the process. I also think, and we've discussed that our verification process admissions has helped in that we had an example of an employer group that actually did apply this, and when they found out that their employees didn't actually have a network, then they changed their benefits again and basically reverted back to a network benefit. So, I think sometimes people explore ideas without really understanding the full ramifications, and in that case, it worked out well. And so we will continue to put a lot of energy on that. Your second question was around the ballot. Of course, what we liked about it is that we were spending money on making sure that our patients and our teammates didn't suffer from what we call a very dangerous ballot process, but it takes a lot of money to educate the broader state on how to think about that. And so, we are extremely happy that at the end of the day, instead of spending the money on that, our teammates get the benefit of that. As it relates to is it just this election cycle, we talked about two election cycles and that would be a good time to hopefully iron out and revisit our relationship with labor. Lisa Clive : Great. Thanks for the clarification. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Lisa. Operator : And our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. Dean Rosales : Hi. This is Dean on again for Justin. My question is on center closings. And I'm sorry if you've touched on it already, but how much more is there to do here? And could you speak or can you parse out the impact to the P&L from the center closing, right, so revenue versus cost savings from lower fixed costs and efficiencies? Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, I appreciate the question. We are thinking that the year will have roughly 50 centers either closed or merged into other centers. And thinking about roughly in the ZIP code of 20 new centers, so net 30. As it relates to the P&L, I'm not sure I understood your question. Could you try it again? Dean Rosales : More just the moving parts impact to the P&L, just could you speak to how you guys [indiscernible] center closing? Joel Ackerman : I think a good healthy way to think about it is you will have a little volume loss on patient choice. But when you strip all of that, these centers tend to be inefficient. And so, what you do is you consolidate the management and the leadership. And then, you have some savings on fixed expense in particular, rent and medical director fees. And so, at the end of the day, that's where the savings come from, inefficient center with some fixed expenses that get eliminated. Dean Rosales : Got it. Thank you so much. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Pito Chickering with Deutsche. You may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Hi, guys. A few follow-ups here. To Joanna's question, what was the commercial mix in the quarter? And what are you seeing for 2024? Joel Ackerman : Commercial mix for the quarter was 10.9%, and we expect it to stay flattish. Pito Chickering : And then free cash flow conversion was very strong in '23, the guidance is about 54% in '24. Is there anything changing within cash flow conversion? Or is this simply the DSOs that you got, what, 12 days in '23 which won't repeat in '24? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. You've got it right. '23 was a really impressive decline in DSOs. '24, the free cash flow conversion remains well above net income, and that's really driven by two things. One is just structurally our CapEx is lower than our depreciation and amortization. And second is share-based comp, stock-based comp. And those two things should persist, and that's why, call it, 125% of net income that we're driving in free cash flow for this year, we would expect to persist for some time. Pito Chickering : Okay. Like any updates on AB 290? Javier Rodriguez : There is a little update. There is some activity on it. But at the end of the day, maybe the best way to summarize it is that the judge hasn't had a final ruling, but gave some color. And in that color, basically both parties won some points and both parties lost some points. And so therefore, the odds of an appeal are quite high when there is a final ruling. And so, the next question is probably if you were to say what will be the financial impact we had guided to in the past, something in the $25 million to $40 million range. And as less people are on the AKF, I think that number is likely to be lower, more like a $0 million to $25 million would be a good range. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. And then last question, I'm going to ask the center closure question differently. What was center [indiscernible] at the end of, I guess, in the fourth quarter of '23? And what do you assume that goes in fourth quarter of '24? Joel Ackerman : I'm sorry, Pito, did you say capacity utilization? Pito Chickering : Yes. I mean just thinking about a combination of centers closing and patients coming back and there's overall center [indiscernible], where do you exit the year in '23? And where do you think that can get to by the end of '24? Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, we're exiting the year at about 58%. And I would expect picking up 1 point, maybe a little bit more over the course of the year. Javier Rodriguez : And just as a point of reference, like if you want to go back pre-COVID, I'm going to go back several years in the 2016 or so range, we would be in the 65%-or-so range. And then just so you see the impact of all of this California conversation that we've had. California, because how difficult the operating environment is, is roughly in the 70% range because people aren't opening centers. So all these very expensive propositions and poor conduct have had an impact and the people do not want to open centers there. Pito Chickering : And then just out of curiosity, if over a multi-year period to get back to 65% kind of, is this worth like 300 bps of G&A leverage here? And kind of if you can size up that for me, that would be wonderful. Joel Ackerman : Yeah. So, the leverage you'd see would be in our patient care costs, it's not in the G&A because there's a fixed cost associated with the clinic that's in the patient care cost. So, you'd see it there. I think the best I can do to help you with that math would be to think about our patient care cost per treatment number, right? So, running at $255 for 2023, that is roughly two-third variable, one-third fixed. So, if you imagine us growing that volume without building as many centers, and just to be clear, we would have to build some centers because even though capacity utilization is low, the capacity may not be exactly where in the country you need it to be. So, depending on what assumption you make there, recognizing that a third of that PCC per treatment is fixed, I think that will give you everything you need to do to do the math on what it could be worth. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much, guys. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Pito. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for your interest in DaVita. Just in summary, we had a strong close to the year and that, combined with our guidance 2024, we are now back on a path to recuperate our pre-pandemic financial trajectory. We will continue to work hard to deliver strong results, innovate, and most importantly, provide a great clinical care for our patients. Thank you all for joining the call. Be well.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Eliason, you may begin your conference. Nic Eliason : Thank you, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Nic Eliason, Group Vice President of Investor Relations, and joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO.  Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements, except as may be required by law.  Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Nic, and thank you all for joining our call today. Through the first quarter, we continued building on the momentum generated through 2023, demonstrating operational discipline while continuing to find opportunities to invest, innovate and most importantly, deliver clinical excellence. Today, I will cover our first quarter results, provide color on our expanding international business and wrap up with an update on Change Healthcare claim disruption. Before we get into our first quarter performance, I'll start as we always do with a clinical highlight. One of our strategic goals is to provide solutions for patients at every stage along the kidney care journey, including helping to support transplantation. Our aspiration is to enable as many patients as possible to receive this life-changing gift. Let me highlight 3 ways that DaVita is helping to address the systemic challenges of kidney transplant. The first is patient referrals to transplant centers. We recently achieved our highest monthly rate with more than 2/3 of DaVita patients under the age of 75 years old being referred for transplant. The second is living donation. The number of living donors in the United States has essentially been flat over the past 2 decades. To encourage more living donors, we partnered with the National Kidney Foundation on its Big Ask, Big Give campaign to educate the community on living donation. We also offered patients a range of resources to support them through the conversations about living donation. And finally, because there is a gap on transplant rates across race and ethnicity, we created a new Health Equity Learning Lab. By deploying transplant navigators, we're testing novel approaches to drive a more equitable distribution of patients succeeding on their quest to receive a transplant. Through these and other efforts, more than 8,000 DaVita patients received a kidney transplant in 2023, the highest number of annual transplant in our history. Unfortunately, the largest challenge continues to be constrained organ supply. You may have seen recent stories about compassionate care cases involving genetically engineered-pig kidneys. This is an exciting first step as society aspires to a future where organ availability is no longer a constraint for patients living with kidney disease. It is still in its early days for this technology as human trials will take some time. In the meantime, we will continue to invest in transplant and participate in innovations that will improve access to this life-changing outcome. Transitioning to our first quarter performance. Adjusted operating income was $463 million, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.38. We had a strong quarter across our core financial trilogy with treatment volume and patient care costs performing in line with our expectations and incremental upside driven by revenue per treatment. Our Q1 performance provided increased confidence in our full year expectations, and therefore, we're raising the bottom of our adjusted operating income guidance putting our updated range at $1.875 billion to $1.975 billion. Within these consolidated results, our international business is a growing piece of DaVita's portfolio. As a reminder, our international strategy is focused on 3 primary principles, first, identify markets that enable us to invest in clinical differentiation and provide excellent standards of care to our patients. Second, operate in countries where we have a path to achieve meaningful scale led by strong local management teams. And finally, hold ourselves to the same discipline of capital-efficient growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns that we use for all of our business segments. Following these principles, in March, we signed an agreement to invest $300 million to expand our operations in Brazil and Colombia and enter Chile, and Ecuador through the acquisitions of high-quality centers in those 4 markets. The Chile acquisition has closed and the transaction in Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil remains subject to each country's respective antitrust and regulatory approval process, which we expect to be completed at various times throughout 2024. Opportunistic transactions such as this one are consistent with our overall enterprise capital allocation strategy. Going forward, we will continue to monitor the market for acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria and we otherwise expect international investment to be roughly consistent with our historical levels.  Upon completion of these transactions and combined with our existing business, we would be the largest dialysis provider in Latin America. Once these acquisitions close, we will provide care in 13 countries outside the United States with more than 500 centers treating approximately 80,000 patients and employing nearly 20,000 health care professionals. In 2024, we expect international growth to contribute approximately $20 million or about 1 percentage point to DaVita's overall enterprise growth in adjusted operating income. Most importantly, our international clinical outcomes continue to excel. We outperformed the clinical benchmarks of every international market in which we operate, and we have reduced hospitalizations across all countries by 11% since 2021, which has driven a reduction in unnecessary health care expense and represents a meaningful improvement to our patients' lives. And finally, let me cover our experience with the Change Healthcare outage and where we stand today. Historically, the vast majority of our U.S. dialysis claim went through the Change platform. Similar to many providers, this presented a challenging situation in the back half of Q1 as we were unable to submit claims through this channel. As reflected in our first quarter balance sheet, the increase in our days sales outstanding and borrowing on our revolving credit facility were entirely related to the Change outage. Joel will provide more detail, but to summarize, we have resumed billing activity, and we're collecting cash well in excess of our typical levels as we catch up from the claims backlog. As of today, we believe that the operational impact from the Change Healthcare disruptions are largely resolved.  I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, Javier. First quarter adjusted operating income was $463 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.38, and free cash flow was negative $327 million. Our Q1 results reflect strong core operating performance as well as the impacts from delayed submission and payment of claims due to the Change Healthcare outage, which I will expand on shortly. With that, let me dive into the detail for the quarter.  U.S. dialysis treatments per day were slightly lower in Q1 as compared to Q4, consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Q1 was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year new-to-dialysis admissions growth, although mortality remains elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. For the full year, we maintain our expectations of 1% to 2% treatment volume growth. Revenue per treatment was down approximately $2 quarter-over-quarter. This is primarily due to typical seasonality related to patient coinsurance and deductibles offset by typical rate increases, contracted escalators and mix improvements. We continue to see strength in RPT as the result of revenue cycle improvements and we're trending towards the top of our original RPT range of 2.5% to 3% growth year-over-year.  Non-GAAP patient care cost per treatment declined $8 sequentially, down from the seasonally elevated fourth quarter. As a reminder, Q4 seasonality was higher than typical and we see this reflected in the sequential quarterly change. International adjusted operating income increased $15 million sequentially, a return to normal from a low in Q4 related to higher bad debt reserves. Additionally, Q1 benefited from foreign exchange tailwinds. As Javier mentioned, this quarter, we announced acquisitions in 4 Latin American countries, including our entrance into Chile and our anticipated entrants into Ecuador. These acquisitions are expected to close at various points during 2024 and we anticipate that their partial year operating income in 2024 will largely be offset by expenses related to the acquisitions. Transitioning to cash flow and capital allocations. As you'll see in our quarter end numbers, U.S. dialysis days sales outstanding increased by 19 days. And at the end of the quarter, we were drawn $765 million on our revolver, reflecting an increase in our leverage ratio to 3.3x at the end of Q1. As Javier noted, these increases are directly attributable to the Change Healthcare outage. Since the Change platform has come back online, these metrics have improved dramatically. We have caught up and are now current on primary claims submission. Cash receipts are catching up and we have fully paid down the $765 million of revolver draw through a combination of strong April cash flow and interest-free funding from UnitedHealth Group, Change's parent company. By the end of Q2, we expect the majority of the DSO increase to have reversed.  In Q1, we repurchased 2.1 million shares, but out of an abundance of caution, we temporarily suspended our share repurchases in March in light of the Change disruption. Given where we are today, we expect to resume share repurchases subject to our typical capital allocation considerations. As we look to full year 2024, we are updating adjusted operating income guidance to $1.875 billion to $1.975 billion, a $25 million increase in the midpoint relative to our previous guidance. We are also updating EPS guidance to a range from $9 to $9.80.  That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Andrew Mok with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Andrew Mok : Treatments per day. I want to follow up on those comments. I think they're in line with your expectations. They were down sequentially and the normalized growth was up 40 basis points year-over-year. So one, trying to understand if there was any impact, whether it's weather or other seasonal impacts on the quarter? And two, any confidence on your levels to get back to 1% to 2% treatment growth for the year? Like what sort of visibility do you have on that? And what's going to drive that from here? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So the big difference between the year-over-year number on treatments per day versus the NAG number or the treatment number is actually day mix. So Q1 in '24 had an extra Tuesday and it also had New Year's Day on a Monday and what happens then is about half the volume gets pushed to Sunday. Those 2 things combined can lead to more than 0.5 point of volume swing. So I think of Q1 year-over-year as a positive number of 40 or 50 bps of year-over-year growth, but as you highlighted, below the 1% to 2% range. As I think about how do you bridge the range of 1% to 2% versus the Q1 number, I'd point to 2 things. First is clinic closures. The timing of clinic closures in the back half of 2023, and the pattern we're expecting for '24 is a drag on volume early in '24, but much less so towards the next 3 quarters. That would be one. The second is there's a lot of seasonality, both in new to dialysis admits as well as to mortality, and that could move from month to month. And just looking at the pattern of what we saw in '23 versus what we're expecting in '24, we still feel good about the 1% to 2% growth but we think it's going to come a little later in the year than anticipated. So I'd emphasize again, Q1 was in line with what we were expecting, the general pattern of new-to-dialysis admits being strong, offset by continued challenges on mortality. None of that has changed, and we feel good about the 1% to 2% for the year. Andrew Mok : Got it. And then I think on that mortality comment, I think you said mortality remains elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. Any trends on how that's been tracking kind of year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter post COVID? Joel Ackerman : It has generally come down significantly since its peak. It does move around from quarter-to-quarter, and it's frankly, still a little early to know exactly where Q1 landed. As you know, we don't find out mortality until a few months after the period. So we're keeping a careful eye on it. It's -- as I said, it's come way down, but remains elevated. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just one more on patient care costs. Cost per treatment were down another 1% year-over-year, and I think 3% sequentially. Anything in particular to call out there that helped drive the strong results. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So sequentially, it's a lot about the higher seasonality we saw in Q4 that we called out. Year-over-year, wage pressure continues, as we've said, it's offset versus Q1 of '23 by lower contract costs and also a productivity pickup in the quarter. Operator : Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : So revenue per treatment, really strong in the quarter. Was that due to sort of HIX enrollment or any other one-timers in there? Usually, it goes up sort of $4 to $5 sequentially as we burn through copays and deductibles. Is that the way to think -- is that the right way to think about it for rest of the year? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I think that is right. The seasonality of, call it, $5 a treatment that we typically see in Q1, we saw this quarter. So we'd expect to pick that up in RPT in Q2 and the rest of the year. In terms of anything unusual in the quarter, nothing that I would highlight. I think the Q1 number is a pretty clean number off of which to model the rest of the year. Pito Chickering : Okay. So that's sort of tracking above your guidance, like, if we move back to kind of where you guys are guiding revenue per treatment, you're basically guiding sort of almost mid-single digits. I mean sort of -- above sort of 3% range, and already and this continues, right? Joel Ackerman : We're right around the high end of the range, right around the 3%. If you think of the guide as being up $25 million at the midpoint, and you attribute that to RPT, which is, I think, a fair way to think about it, that would put you right around 3% year-over-year. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. Was the Street mismodeling the first quarter operating income looking at the adjusted operating income beat of $39 million and the raise of $25 million. It looks [ again like you ] didn't raise the high point of the range. Just curious if you're missing it. And then is there any reason why you can't analyze the first quarter in  OI sort of 23% to get to sort of $2 billion. I guess, why would that -- assuming trends don't change, why would that not be the right way to thinking about sort of where things could go if first quarter trends continue? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So look, seasonality is something that's -- I think there are clear patterns in our seasonality, but it does vary from year to year. The RPT pickup from Q1, I think, is probably the clearest part of our seasonality. Other things would be wage pressure tends to grow over the course of the year as does other parts of RPT, but the wage pressure tends to be higher. And then we often see Q4 expenses going up for year-end and other items. So we've seen, as we did in '23, some real negative seasonality in Q4. That's all around U.S. dialysis. .  IKC is tougher to call out. We tend to do a little bit better in the back half of the year. But as you know, that can move around from year to year. So annualizing Q1, I don't think is the best way to get you there. I think actually, if you annualize our OI, you'd come in a little bit below our range. So I think you've got to adjust for the RPT. You've got to think about the Q4 seasonal weakness, and you'd get a number in our range. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. And then one quick numbers question. Can you quantify the number of new patients to dialysis in this quarter versus where that was this time last year? Joel Ackerman : I don't have a number for you. That number typically grows with -- around the volume growth -- around our historical volume growth numbers, and I think it's right in there with that this quarter as well. Operator : Our next caller is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. I guess, it does kind of seem like going back to the RPT that like it feels more like you're raising the guidance for the outperformance in the quarter on that rather than a continuation of that higher rate sustaining? Is that true? Or you're saying the guidance now assumes that this higher rate is actually sustained throughout the rest of the year? Joel Ackerman : We're not raising it, assuming that this beat persists throughout the year. We're -- the quarter came in better than expected, but I don't think you can multiply that by 4 to get to the new number. Kevin Fischbeck : So why is that the case? It sounds like you're saying there is something unusual in it. So why -- Pito's question before, like why isn't it the seasonal kind of growth for the space and then therefore flow through every quarter? Joel Ackerman : It's -- I think part of it is how we were modeling it for the year, and it came in -- the pattern came in a little bit different than we expected. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. So you had a higher year-end number and you're just getting there faster according to what you've seen in [ Q1 ]. Joel Ackerman : Yes. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then, I guess, just on the IKC business, obviously, there's a lot of focus on cost trend within Medicare Advantage companies seem to be all over the place on in another year. Your experience is going to be a little bit different to Medicare Advantage broadly, but just love to kind of hear how you're seeing utilization play out under your managed programs there? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Let me grab that one. I think the question that comes often is why are the MA players in kidney saying different things. And the reality is the utilization in the broader MA population has more volatility. Our patients while have many comorbid conditions, they're more predictable, so we have less volatility. In addition, as you know, broader MA had some coding changes that didn't apply to our population. And so that, again, removes some of the volatility that they're experiencing. And so our trends are a lot more stable in our population. Does that answer your question? Kevin Fischbeck : Yes. No, it does. I guess you're basically saying that it's coming in line, not -- it's not higher or lower than what you were predicting so far in Q1. Javier Rodriguez : Correct. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then maybe just last question. International business acquisition, it sounds like you guys are really excited about it. We always just kind of wondered that sometimes like when one large-scale player exits an asset and another large-scale player comes in? Like how do you think about what you can add to those assets? Or how do you just think about what the opportunity was there, if someone else in theory had similar optionality felt like it was time to get out. Javier Rodriguez : It's a great question, and we're not arrogant enough to say that we're better operators. What we're looking at is that there's some efficiencies to be gained by economies of scale. We were present in these countries, and we had offices that we could leverage. So in essence, the fixed part of the business was levered in a more meaningful way. And so I think that that's how one entity can exit and the other entity, you can see, it is an attractive asset. But as we said in the beginning, we look at our normal filters of clinical differentiation. We wanted to scale and help them with the scale, and we thought we could get to a good attractive risk adjusted return. Operator : And our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Dean Rosales : This is Dean Rosales on for Justin. Any color you can share on wage inflation. What are you assuming for the year? And my second question would be any update on how mistreatment rates are tracking sequentially, yearly. Any trends there? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So on wage inflation, we called out at the beginning of the year, we were expecting something around 5%, and it's tracking pretty consistent with what we were expecting. So not a lot to update on that. .  In terms of mistreatment rate, it's doing what we had largely expected, which is slowly improving year after year post COVID, not a lot to call out. It's a pretty small magnitude. We think we'll get back to our historical mistreatment rate over a few years. So in any given year, it's not really a significant number. Dean Rosales : Got it. And last one, what should we expect in terms of center consolidations for the remainder of the year? Javier Rodriguez : Thanks, Dean. I think the number will be somewhere in the 30 or so closures sort of net, that would be the right number to have on the net build and closures. Operator : Gary Taylor with Cowen. Gary Taylor : Maybe just to follow up on that last one. That's a [ 30 ] net for the next 3 quarters or that's the full year number? Javier Rodriguez : That's a full year number. Gary Taylor : Got it. I just -- I wanted to ask, first, I'm going to commend you for producing margin growth well in excess of what the Street is able to model. I think there's a third quarter in a row where you've produced 30% to 50% OI growth on 6% to 8% revenue growth. So it's really stunning cost management, productivity, all the things you guys are doing. Once we anniversary that, so maybe there's another quarter there, but when we get into the back half of '24, are there still some good reasons to believe that, that operating leverage can sustain at something above your long-term 3% to 7% OI guidance, like what would be a couple of key swing factors to be optimistic about some level of operating margin leverage continuing? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So first, thank you, Gary, for those kind words. As we look forward, I don't think we're changing our long-term OI growth number from 3% to 7%. So I'd start with that. That said, I also don't think we're running out of opportunities to continue to run the business well and deliver high-quality clinical care to our patients and continue to improve our bottom line and potentially our margins. we've done this not just on the back of cost cutting, I would highlight, right? We've done a lot on the revenue side that has kicked in nicely. But I think there are other opportunities as well. Continued progress on IKC would be on the list. I think capacity utilization improvements would be another important one that I point to. I think there are other components of our cost structure, which could be productivity, could be other things nonlabor-related that we can continue to manage. So I don't feel like we're running out of ideas. That said, we're also not ready to raise our long-term OI guidance above 3% to 7%. Gary Taylor : Maybe last one for me. I just want to maybe understand tender [ consolidations ] a little bit. When we look at average patients per center, certainly multi-multiyear high. And just in the last couple of years, I think, patients per center is up 9% in a couple of years and your margins improved, I think, nearly 300 basis points as that's happened. Some of that's the consolidation. Some of that is expansion of your home programs driving that. Is this still a key lever going forward or beyond the 30 centers Javier talked about. Javier Rodriguez : Well, I think the -- let me clarify because a couple of those numbers didn't resonate, but maybe we can clarify them here. I think the better way to think about it is how are we doing in utilization of our centers and preclosing of these centers pre the excess mortality, we were in the mid-60s of utilization. And right now, we're at [ 58-ish ] percent utilization. And so we have more capacity available, and therefore, we're less likely to have a need to deploy capital to build centers. And while our home has improved, it hasn't improved that much. Our mix continues to be around 15% of our patients at home. And so hopefully, that clarifies a couple of those points there. Joel Ackerman : Yes. And Gary, just to add one thing on to what Javier said, we can improve capacity utilization without closing any more centers. We're just absorbing treatment growth in our existing footprints. Gary Taylor : Adding shifts, adding machines. Joel Ackerman : Right. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next caller is A.J. Rice with UBS. Albert Rice : Thanks, everybody. First, maybe just to ask on the trajectory on IKC, I know you were forecasting for '24 a loss of about $50 million. And I think in the first quarter, you're at $26 million. I know there's seasonal factors and a variety of things going on. But I just wonder if you would say you're on track? Are you running a little better? Or how should we put that in perspective? Joel Ackerman : Yes. I would say we're largely on track. There's a lot of seasonality in this business. And obviously, you learn more as the year progresses, but there was nothing surprising to us in the Q1 results. Albert Rice : Okay. And then another coming off the fourth quarter, I think we had triangulated -- I don't think it's your specific guidance but triangulate it that you're sort of expecting share repurchases to be in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range for '24. With your comments about how the first quarter played out, do you think you'll still get to something that maybe approximates that? Or should we just assume that the first quarter share repurchase activity has gone and you'll continue in the last 3 at the previous rate. Javier Rodriguez : I think we still aspire to that goal. There's obviously a timing component to it, and we'll watch it, but we're still aspiring to get it all done. Albert Rice : Okay. And just lastly, a follow-on question and comments about the international acquisition. I guess, it sounds like that is, in your mind, more of an opportunistic deal that came along that allows you, like you said, to leverage in certain markets and enter some new ones. Is there anything that's happening on the international front that makes you think that the pace of activity there could step up? Javier Rodriguez : No. I think you've got it in the right light, which is we are opportunistic, and we're always looking for a transaction that meets the criteria that we've outlined. And if we don't find it, we don't execute. And if we find it, we do. And so there's no urgency or rush but rather just doing business with discipline and according to our plan. Operator : Our next caller is Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Lisa Clive : A few questions for me. On the utilization figures that you mentioned, that's just looking at your in-center population, right? I'm just trying to think about how to layer in whole patients on top of that, assuming that population continues to grow faster than your in-center patients, whether essentially that improves the number of patients per clinic, but then in terms of utilization, you just think of the in-center.  And then second question, could you tell us what percentage of your patients are on MIRCERA today? Just trying to understand how much more costs you could potentially squeeze out from that transition. And then lastly, do you have any preliminary thoughts, comments on online hemodiafiltration. I assume in your European centers, you use that technology. It obviously remains to be seen how quickly FMC can launch those machines and ramp up scale to be able to sell them in the U.S., but just would love your thoughts on that. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. Let me take them in order. And if I miss anything, please remind me. On utilization, that number is the chronic center utilization, and the way to think about a home is, of course, it can add patients much easier and with much lower capital deployment. And so you got it right that utilization that we gave is in-center. As it relates to MIRCERA, that's pretty much the vast majority if not all are now on MIRCERA. And so that's played out. And then on hemodiafiltration, I think it will be interesting to see how that plays out in the United States because it's -- as you know, it's allowed in many different countries. And the numbers that we have are really all over the place, meaning in some countries, the vast majority of patients get it. While in others, it's a tiny percentage of the patients that get it. And so while there is 1 or 2 studies that say that it could be better because it gets the mid molecules through. There's a lot of holes that you can poke in those studies and so we'll have to see how that plays out. And then, of course, the FDA approved the machine, but we don't have any reimbursement guidance. So at the end of it, you'll have to incorporate, a, what the doctor wants, what the patient wants because it might take more time to do that treatment and then put the economic model on top of that. So we've got too many variables there that are still to be defined to be able to size it in a helpful way. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Speakers, I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing comments. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Well, thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for your questions and interest in DaVita. As we discussed on the call, we're off to a strong start of the year. And of course, we'll continue to work hard to stay on this trajectory. First and foremost, we remain vigilant in providing great clinical care for our patients. Thank you all for joining the call, and be well. Operator : And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Eliason, you may begin your conference. Nic Eliason : Thank you and welcome to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I\u2019m Nic Eliason, Group Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our second quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we may make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally, we\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Nic and thank you all for joining our call today. On behalf of all the teammates who provide lifesaving care to our patients, I am grateful for the opportunity to report another positive quarter for DaVita. We continue to enhance our clinical capabilities while optimizing our revenue, operations and cost structure. Today, I will cover the details of our second quarter performance, comment on the CMS 2025 proposal, and wrap up with our outlook for the remaining of the year. But before I dive in, let me begin, as we always do, with a clinical highlight. As you know, every day, tens of thousands of DaVita caregivers work to give life to our patients. Nurses play a central role within our interdisciplinary care teams, serving as our patient's caregiver, sounding board and familiar face they see over 100 times per year. Unfortunately, thousands of nurses left the profession during the pandemic. As a result, the healthcare system is facing a critical nursing shortage. I am proud of the programs and initiatives we've implemented to support the next generation of dialysis nurses. I'll highlight three examples. First, we're collaborating with leading nursing universities on tailored nephrology specific nursing curriculum. We're also providing financial assistance to remove barriers to entry for prospective nursing students. Second, we've created a clinical internship program immersing students with hands on experience in DaVita Dialysis Centers. We have 700 clinical interns this year, with more than 2000 individuals participating since inception of the program. Third, we've built a nurse residency program to support new nurses from student to practicing registered nurse. Our goal is to help hundreds of nurses in the program to feel more confident during their first year of practice, which, among other things, can lead to better patient safety. We're excited to do our part to alleviate some of the pressures of the nursing workforce and to help ensure access to care is not a barrier. Transitioning to the second quarter performance adjusted operating income was $506 million and adjusted earnings per share was $2.59. This outcome was ahead of our expectations for the quarter, primarily driven by favorability in patient care costs and continued strength in revenue per treatment or RPT. Offsetting this favorability was volume growth that was lower than expected. This was primarily due to elevated mistreatments related to spring storms, along with lower than expected census gain. Our second quarter adjusted results also included approximately $15 million of center closure costs. In prior periods we excluded these type of costs from adjusted operating income as non-GAAP adjustments. We'll expand on this point throughout the call today. Let me give some additional detail on RPT growth, since it continues to contribute to our strong performance and supports our 2024 guidance increase. There are many variables in RPT, but I'll highlight two primary drivers. The first and largest component is continuous improvement in our collection capabilities. This is a multiyear effort, so let me elaborate a bit more on this one. The complexity of revenue operations has increased over the last few years. Billing and collecting from health plans now more frequently involves new data and process requirements. These challenges include navigating prior authorization, payer-specific billing requirements, numerous online payer portals, and separately billable items. These layers are exacerbated by a growing list of participating health plans due to the growth of Medicare Advantage and exchanges, and by our patients more frequently updating their coverage choices. In response, we made a series of targeted investments in technology and teammates to modernize and retain top in class capabilities. These investments focus on greater automation of routine tasks, increasing rate of electronic claim submission, and more frequent benefit insurance verification, among other enhancements. This has improved our overall collection rate and enabled us to collect on claims more quickly, reducing day sales outstanding. With more comfort and experience with these capabilities over the past year, we believe these improvements are sustainable and will continue into 2020 and beyond. Second, our health plan negotiations have resulted in modestly higher rate increases as a result of higher inflationary environment over the past few years. Despite these rate increases, we are still not recouping the full impact of high inflation. We continue our track record of innovation and discipline within our cost structure to bridge this gap. The combination of these two factors, along with continued improvement in payer mix increases our expectations for RPT growth for the year. In the first quarter, we communicated our expectation to land on the top end of our range of 2.5% to 3% RPT growth in 2024. With continued progress, we now expect 2024 RPT growth within a range of 3.5% to 4%. Staying on the topic of revenue, CMS recently released its ESRD Proposed Rule to update the prospective payment system for 2025. The CMS expected rate increase of approximately 2.1% was broadly in line with our internal expectations. The methodology has become more complex with the introduction of new wage index, and while we appreciate CMS effort to innovate, the proposal falls short of reflecting the industry true cost inflation. We will provide feedback to CMS in hope of improving this methodology in the final rule and in the years ahead. Absent further edits, the proposed rule would continue to put pressure on the system. Additionally, with the proposed rule, CMS reconfirmed its intention to include oral-only drugs within the bundle as scheduled beginning next year and identified positive policy changes to aid with this transition. DaVita supports CMS position and given our experience with calcimedics, we strongly believe this will provide more patients with access to these drugs since many of our patients do not have Part D coverage. We understand that there are entities arguing for Congress to delay the implementation with stated concern around patient access and the operational ability for providers to comply. DaVita is well prepared and investing the necessary resources to implement this transition in support of our patients. Turning to full year guidance, we are raising our 2024 adjusted operating income guidance while incorporating a change in treatment of our center closure expenses. We are raising 2024 adjusted operating income guidance from the prior range of $1.875 billion to $1.975 billion to a new range of $1.91 billion to $2.01 billion. This represents a $35 million increase at the midpoint of the range. This is the result of a $95 million increase in expected operating performance offset by now including approximately $60 million of full-year center closure costs that we previously would have excluded from adjusted operating income as a non-GAAP adjustment. Joel will provide more detail about this change in our non-GAAP reporting presentation. This guidance reflects sustained momentum in our key operating metrics, including the revenue per treatment progress we highlighted today and our expectations for a strong performance in the back half of the year. I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thanks Javier. Our second quarter adjusted operating income was $506 million, adjusted EPS was $2.59 and free cash flow was $654 million. Before I dive into the specifics on our performance for the quarter, let me add some detail to the change in reporting presentation of our non-GAAP results that Javier mentioned. As a result of a recent common letter from the SEC to DaVita we will no longer treat center closure costs as an adjustment in our non-GAAP presentations. These center closure costs impact our patient care cost, G&A and depreciation and amortization expense lines. Our adjusted OI and adjusted EPS for Q2 now include center closure costs and our updated full-year 2024 guidance shared today follows the same methodology. To help with comparisons to prior periods, we are also now showing prior period results under the new methodology. In aggregate, these costs represent approximately $15 million per quarter in 2024 for a total of roughly $60 million expected this year. For comparison, center closure costs in 2023 were approximately $100 million. For 2025, we are forecasting $20 million to $30 million of center closure costs. These presentation changes have no impact on how we manage our business nor our overall profitability, cash flow, or long-term expectations. With that, let me break down each of the components of our Q2 performance starting with U.S. dialysis and specifically treatment volume. Sequentially, treatments per day were up 1.1% in Q2 versus Q1. This increase was primarily due to census gains in the quarter and a seasonal improvement in mistreatment rate. Compared to the same period last year second quarter treatments per day were up 50 basis points. Beryl: Second, U.S. net census gains were weaker than expected. Although new to dialysis admits grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, mortality was above our forecast. We expect both of these factors to negatively impact the second half of the year. For the full year, we now expect treatment volume growth will likely be between 0.5% and 1%. Revenue per treatment was up approximately $6 sequentially. This increase is primarily due to typical seasonality from higher patient coinsurance and deductibles in Q1. As Javier outlined, we now anticipate full-year revenue per treatment growth of 3.5% to 4% for 2024. Patient care costs per treatment were approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. Typical seasonal declines from items like higher payroll taxes in Q1 offset higher health benefit costs and other inflationary creases in the second quarter. Depreciation and amortization declined $12 million in Q2 versus Q1, partially as a result of a decline in center closure costs. Center closure costs in D&A were approximately $50 million in 2023, compared to $10 million in 2024. Since these costs are now included in our adjusted D&A numbers, we now expect a year-over-year adjusted D&A decline of approximately $40 million to $50 million. For Integrated Kidney Care or IKC, our value based care business, operating income declined $8 million sequentially. As we have seen in the past, we expect results in the second half of the year to be significantly stronger than the first half as a result of the timing of revenue recognition. International operating income was flat quarter-over-quarter. We have closed our acquisitions in Ecuador and Chile and expect our acquisitions in Colombia to close in Q3 and in Brazil by year-end. Moving now to capital structure, in the second quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares and to date in Q3 we have repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares. Leverage at the end of Q2 was 3.1 times EBITDA. This was down from three months ago due to growth in trailing 12-month EBITDA and a reduction of net debt by over $200 million. As of the end of Q2, we held approximately $400 million of funding from Change Healthcare's parent UnitedHealth Group, related to the cyber event earlier this year. As of today, that balance currently sits at approximately $300 million and we expect additional repayment to align with successful collections on impacted claims. We continue to collect on Change Healthcare impacted claims and U.S. dialysis days sales outstanding have declined by 14 days quarter-over-quarter. As always, we are assessing opportunities to optimize our capital structure, which includes looking to address the remaining balance of our term loan B maturing in 2026. We continue to target leverage within our range of 3 to 3.5 times. To this end, we are also assessing opportunities to increase our debt to ensure sufficient capacity to maintain leverage within this range. To conclude, let me share some additional detail about our updated adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS guidance for 2024. As Javier said, our new adjusted OI guidance range is $1.91 billion to $2.01 billion. There are several moving pieces within this number, so let me give you the key puts and takes. First, we are now including expenses related to center closure costs in this adjusted OI range. This is an approximate $60 million of additional operating expenses that were previously not in our adjusted OI guidance. To reiterate my earlier comments, this is a change in the presentation of our adjusted results and does not impact our GAAP financials or cash flows. Second, additional RPT growth of approximately 50 to 100 basis points relative to our previous expectations represents an increase of approximately $85 million at the midpoint. Third, the range reflects improved expectations for patient care costs, mostly related to labor and productivity improvements, which is mostly offset by our revised volume expectations for the full year. Altogether, these changes represent an approximate $35 million increase in our adjusted operating income guidance at the midpoint of the range. We are also updating our 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $9.25 to $10.05 primarily due to the increase in adjusted OI. That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead sir. Pito Chickering : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Nice quarter and thanks for taking the questions. On the NAG, can you give us some color on what you saw through the quarter and what you saw in July? Just looking at the high end of your revised guidance, you get to grow like 1.5%, which is a big step up versus what you saw in the first half of the year. So just want to sort of see kind of what you guys are seeing to give you confidence in the high end of that. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. Thanks, Pito. So through the quarter, what we really saw was mistreatments were elevated relative to what we expected and our census growth was below expectations. The pattern there has continued new to dialysis admits remain strong and the growth there is consistent with what we had seen pre-COVID and mortality remains elevated. In terms of the back half of the year, I'd point out one thing that gives us confidence, which is we've got an extra treatment day in the second half of the year relative to the second half of the year last year. So that in and of itself is about 30 bps of additional growth. Other than that, we really haven't modeled in a whole lot of changes for the back half of the year. We haven't built in much census growth, and we're expecting mistreatment rate to continue to be challenging. So if you really think about the back half of the year, year-over-year growth, it's really about treatment days rather than any change in any of the underlying assumptions. Pito Chickering : Okay, fair enough. And you gave some of the moving parts, but if we exclude the $60 million of closure costs, you raised guidance by $95 million. Can you just bridge us the components of sort of how you raise guidance by $95 million versus previous guidance? I just want to understand that as I think about sort of 2025. Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Sure. So I'd start with revenue per treatment, where we moved the guide from what essentially last quarter was 3% now to 3.5% to 4%. So at the midpoint, 75 bps is worth roughly $85 million. So that's number one. And that's coming from a combination of continued success on the revenue operations, strength in contracting that we've seen through the year so far, and then a little bit of mix improvement, so that's the dominant factor and worth $85 million. Contributing to that as well is some improvement we're seeing in labor costs. I'd highlight two things there. First, some of the premium pay, whether it's overtime or spot bonuses, have come down. And second, we are seeing a little bit better productivity in the year than expected. Those two things combined are worth about $30 million. And offsetting that is about $20 million of OI headwind from the lower volume that we've called out. So plus $85 million from RPT, plus $30 million from labor minus $20 million from volume, that will get you to $95 million increase before taking into account the $60 million change in center closure cost. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks. Let me just followup on Pito's question there. You said $20 million from lower volume? Javier Rodriguez : That's right, Justin. Justin Lake : And you took down volume by what, 75 bps at the midpoint? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I would say, as we were thinking about it, we probably weren't internally modeling as of last quarter that we'd be at the midpoint. So you'd probably get to a little bit of a lower -- you'd have to start at a slightly lower volume number to bridge to that $20 million. Justin Lake : So maybe it's 50 basis points. I'm just trying to think about the relativity here volume to OI? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, you're in the right ballpark yes. Justin Lake : So in your mind, 50 basis points of volume is about $20 million of OI on an annual basis? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. If you had asked me, just stand alone, what's 50 basis points of volume worth? I probably would have told you $50 million to $60 million. So maybe use a slightly lower number. Justin Lake : [Indiscernible] it's not the same thing. Javier Rodriguez : Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Correcting me, 1% is worth 50 to 60. So you're in the right ballpark there. Justin Lake : Okay. And then on center closures, did you say $20 million or $30 million for next year? Javier Rodriguez : Yes for 2025, we think the number will be in that range. Justin Lake : Okay. Javier Rodriguez : And just to be clear about that, when you're modeling center closure costs, it's important to realize that not all the costs come right when we close a clinic. Some of them, like lease acceleration costs for example, can have a delay from when we close the clinic. So I think by next year, our clinic closure rate should actually be back to what it was pre-COVID level, call it 20 clinics a year, somewhere in that range. But the costs we're calling out will be a holdover from what we've seen. Some of them will be a holdover from the clinic closures in 2024. Justin Lake : Got it. That's what I was trying to get to. So you think you'll be back to, like 2020 center closures next year? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, something like that. This year, I think last quarter we had called out 50 for the year. We're probably running light. And I would guess at the end of the year, we'll probably have closed only about 40 for the year and getting back to a more normal pace for next year. Justin Lake : Okay. And then just a question before I jump off on revenue for treatment. One, I think you said in the release you had some offsets to pricing from mix pressure. What's mix in the second quarter versus Q1? Javier Rodriguez : Mix was down a drop in Q2, but it's hanging right around 11%. It's right where it was at the beginning of the year. Our commercial mix at the end of Q1, which I don't think we disclosed, was a little bit harder to estimate because of some of the changes, some of the challenges with Change Healthcare as some of the claims were delayed. But I don't think there has been a lot of movement on commercial mix between Q1 and Q2 that would have any real financial impact. Justin Lake : And then lastly on the exchanges, so I assume that you were at 10.9 to end the year, if I remember the fourth quarter report. But let's say you're at 11. How much of that's coming from exchanges today and how much of that came from exchanges let's say pre-COVID. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, the number is up about 200 basis points. Justin Lake : Okay, I'll take that. I appreciate it, guys. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is AJ Rice with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. AJ Rice : Hi. Thanks for the question. On the IKC business, I guess year to date, the loss, if I've calculated rice, about 60 million. I know your target for the year is $50 million and as you did say in the prepared remarks, you think you'll see more positive in the back half of the year. Is 50 million still the expectation? And does that suggest you'll be positive in both the third and fourth quarter? Javier Rodriguez : Thanks for the question, AJ. You've got the numbers right, meaning we're at negative $60 million and change for the up to year-to-date, and we still expect the year to come in in that $50 million range. But it's not necessarily because there's a big change in the business, but rather revenue recognition on the back end of the year and so that's the big difference there. And as you know, this business, and we've asked you to look at it more on an annual basis, because quarter to quarter fluctuation can be a bit more dramatic, but that still holds on the range. Joel Ackerman : Yes. And AJ, just on the quarterly spread between Q3 and Q4, it can be hard for us to predict when the revenue will land. That said I would expect Q3 to be a loss making quarter again and Q4 to be a much, much stronger quarter. Then again, depending on when we get information, some of the Q4 revenue could pull forward to Q3. AJ Rice : Okay. And obviously, it sounds like the comments on the volume are mostly around the storm impact and mistreatment, but you did sort of mention mortality. What did you see in mortality? And was that a significant contributor to your decision to adjust or that's just the normal fluctuations you see from quarter-to-quarter? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So the short answer is mortality is definitely higher than we expected and maybe it would be helpful to step back for a second and just give you a sense of how we're thinking structurally about where we are on volume for the year. And as we step back, the question we have been asking ourselves is, we are behind on volume growth, call it 150 bps relative to pre-COVID relative to where we'd like to be. And we've spent a lot of time trying to quantify that. We are limited by the information we have, both the quality of the data as well as the timeliness of the data, recognizing we're playing with relatively small numbers here, 100 bps, 150 bps with inputs that have a decent amount of volatility or variability. That said, as we try and quantify it, we think the $150 million gap between where our volume growth for the year is relative to where it was pre-COVID is really made up of two things. About 50 bps to 100 bps of that gap is related to mortality. Mortality is just running higher than it was. It's actually up this year relative to where it was six months ago. And we think structurally, that's the biggest component of why we're not 150 basis points higher. The second thing we believe relates to the capital efficient approach we took to managing our clinic footprint. You go back three or four years, volume for us and the whole industry was beginning to decline. We recognized that our capacity utilization was going down, and we were very focused on getting back to a healthy capacity utilization, one that could support our investment in our teams, in clinical quality and in information technology. And the result of that was we pulled back on de novos before others did, and we closed roughly 200 clinics over the last few years. The result of all that was a decline in our clinic share over the last few years, call it a point and a quarter, roughly. And with that, we believe we have lost some volume. It's hard to quantify, but if we had to put a range on, it would probably be somewhere in the range of 40 to 60 basis points. So you put those two things together, 50 to 100 basis points of mortality higher than historical, combined with 40 to 60 basis point impact from our clinics footprint management and we think that explains the majority of the 150 basis point gap. I will note one important thing new to dialysis admits is not on our list of the gap. As I've said before, those remain strong. The growth in new dialysis admits is consistent with the growth we saw pre-COVID and remains at a healthy level. So I hope at the beginning, I answered your question about the year and then gave you a bit more color on the bigger picture. Javier, anything to add? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, I'll add one thing. First of all, at the beginning of the sentence, Joel inadvertently said 150 million, and he was talking about 150 basis points just to make sure that the record reflects that. The rest of the conversation, he was clear on the 150 basis points. But I think while he walked you through a lot of numbers, at the end of the day, the question that you and all of us are trying to ask ourselves is, is there a structural change that is going to change the growth rate? And to the best of our ability on the work that we've done the answer that we come up with is no. It appears that we are in a bit of just, let's call it a period of time where mortality is elevated, but we see through these new to dialysis patients that the volume should come back to normality over time. AJ Rice : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next caller is Andrew Mok with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Andrew Mok : Great, thank you. Maybe just to followup on that mortality point, I guess what's the working assumption on why mortality is elevated? Because I think the excess mortality dynamic during the early years of the pandemic would intuitively suggest there would be a tailwind in the aftermath. So what's your working assumption here on why it remains elevated? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. Your question is one that we've been asking a lot, and we've been talking to our physician community and trying to understand what is driving it. The reality is that people come up with hypotheses and you can actually support it a bit, a higher elevated flu season, et cetera. But the real quantifiable answer is not one that we could say with confidence. And if you were going to say on the other side of the equation, we're starting to see improvements on things that should have an impact on mortality, like the integrated kidney care, managing people upstream, new drugs, SGLT2 and GLP-1, et cetera. And so we are scratching our head and we will be working on it, and as soon as we get something with confidence, we will share with you. Andrew Mok : Great. Okay, thank you. And then in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that the improvement in collections is a multiyear effort. And given the strong gains we've seen over the last six quarters, just where are we in this process and how much runway is left beyond 2024? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, I would say there's certainly going to be more in 2025, if from nothing else than just the annualization of the improvements we're anticipating in the back half of the year. Looking forward from there, I think it's safe to say that any benefits from this are going to decline over time. And what I mean by that is their contribution to RPT growth will combine over time. I think everything we've achieved so far is sustainable. That said, it's hard to predict how much more there is and over what time period we're likely to capture it. I think it is fair to say relative to when we started this a few years ago, and when we started talking about it with the street in Q2 of 2022, it has certainly exceeded our expectations. Andrew Mok : Got it. If I could just followup on one more point. I think you called out the clinic closures as being a potential drag to volume growth as well. I think given you and your competitor, one of your big competitors, are closing clinics at the same time, where do you think, how much leakage do you think there is, therefore, where are those patients going to get their dialysis treatment if not one of the two large dialysis chains? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, so we've done a lot of work on this, and interestingly enough, the data we have on clinics is actually better. Clinic share is better than the data we have on treatment share. And we believe that the mid-size and smaller dialysis operators have actually gained share over the last few years. They have closed fewer clinics, they have built more clinics, and the result of that is probably picking up some volume as a result of that. Joel Ackerman : And the question on that, and we ask ourselves, is that good or bad? In general of course, you start to think of market share, and in this one, it's clinic share. And the way that we've looked at it, and of course, time will tell, is that we led the way in stopping de novos as the mortality escalated during the pandemic. So if you see DaVita build, it was very aggressively stopped, and then we led the way in right, sizing the capacity. And so if you were just going to do shorthand, you would say, we've closed roughly 200 centers. And depending on the math, you could say it's roughly $100 to $150 million of fixed expense reduction. And the loss of volume is roughly in that $50 million. So you would say that just with that math, it looks like we're making the right trade off. Of course, there's a lot of other dynamics of patient access, the local relationship with physicians, and all the normal considerations that we have to go into. But I'm just giving you the money side of it. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for all the color. Javier Rodriguez : Sure. Hey, before we take the next question, I just want to come back to an answer I gave to Justin on the exchanges. I talked about 200 basis point increase from the exchanges. I just wanted to clarify, that's 200 basis points of revenue, not 200 basis points of mix increase that came from the exchanges. So just wanted to make sure that was clear. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next caller is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Maybe just to follow up on that point, do you just have, like, the percent of revenue that comes from the exchanges year-to-date so far? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, I'm not sure we're going to, I don't think we're going to give that number, Kevin. Kevin Fischbeck : And then you made a comment in the prepared remarks about leverage, and I think you said that you were looking to add debt that to ensure capacity would be in this range. Are you saying that you would look to potentially lever up to deploy more capital, I guess, on share repurchase, or were you just talking about something else? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, so I wouldn't use the phrase lever up, because what we're really targeting here is maintaining the leverage range of three to 3.5 times. And if our goal was to get our leverage range or our leverage multiple above that, that's what I would characterize as levering up. I think the reality is, as our EBITDA grows, in order to maintain that leverage range of three to 3.5 times, recognizing we're at the low end of that range right now, we need more debt capacity, and it's just using the middle of the number. As EBITDA goes up, you multiply it by 3.25, and that's the capacity you need. So we're thinking about how much debt capacity, do we need to make sure we can stay in that range as EBITDA grows. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And in theory, that capacity would be used on share repurchase. Is that, or is there anything else? Javier Rodriguez : I mean, it would be used using our capital allocation philosophy. So the first thing we would love to do would be to invest it in growth, recognizing it needs to be capital efficient growth, and hit our return thresholds. Barring that, share repurchases would certainly be on the, at the top of the list of how we would use excess capacity to maintain our leverage level. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess just on that point as well, the change line of credit, how do we think about that? That's going to be, I mean, in fact, I guess your free cash flow, but I guess that would be a use of free cash flow to pay that back or you just collect less from United. Javier Rodriguez : No, I just think of it as debt, and it's included in our net debt number today. And if we had, if we drew an extra $400 million on the revolver or we did a bond deal and we used it to pay down the change debt, it's just one form of debt exchanging for another form of debt. So it wouldn't hit free cash flow. It wouldn't change our leverage ratio. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess just going back to the mortality point because it is hard to understand why it's such an issue now. And, I mean, I guess it's hard to say if you don't fully know the reasons behind it. It's hard to say when it would normalize. But is there any thought about why things wouldn't get back to normal over the next couple of quarters? And I guess, what is it that you're looking for to kind of know that you're on the other side of that? Joel Ackerman : Well, predicting it is not a good idea, I don't think, because the odds of being wrong are probably 100%. But the reality is that we do agree with you that we don't think it's structural and that it will revert back to normality. And again, I've highlighted some of the improvements that we think can happen from mortality. And many people say, well, why don't you know exactly what happened? And the assumption is that death happens while they're in dialysis. SNF: Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, maybe just last question. Since revenue for treatment seems to be like a big part of the guidance raise, it sounds like everything that's happened so far you think is sustainable. I guess next moves around a little bit. Can you talk a little bit more about the commercial contracting? It sounds like that has come in a little bit better maybe than you thought it was going to. As far as better capturing recent inflation, how should we think about commercial contracting in the 2025? Is that still going to be a tailwind similar to what you're seeing now, or is that going to normalize for some reason. Joel Ackerman : Well, on RPT, basically you have to think of three dynamics. You have mix, you have negotiations, and you have revenue cycle, and so you're asking about the negotiations. And I think to think about the future, you have to kind of put yourself into the future, which is what is the environment? Is it still inflationary, what contracts are up for negotiation, et cetera? As we've explained in the past, we are comprehensively contracted, and our big contracts usually come up every three to four years. bats: Kevin Fischbeck : Got it. I guess maybe, just maybe, ask a little differently. If you're getting a little bit of commercial contracting, do you feel like there's a shift at all in the negotiations? Whether managed care companies realize they need you more for network reasons or they are appreciating the value, you provide more, and that's giving you a stronger negotiating power, or it's just more. Inflation's higher, and so rising tide lifts all shifts. Javier Rodriguez : I think the conversations are the same, meaning everybody's trying to do their fair share and containing costs. Everybody's trying to add value to the patient community and have an expansive network and just do the best we can. And of course, we have to take into account costs and inflation and all those type of things, but those dynamics haven't changed other than the consideration for inflation. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And our next caller is Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Ryan Langston : Hi. Good evening, thank you. Just a couple from me. On the lower census growth, maybe I missed it, but is that isolated to any particular geographies, or maybe are there just certain geographies that are maybe performing below kind of the average and maybe pulling that down a little bit? Javier Rodriguez : No, Ryan, we're pretty much seeing that across the board. Ryan Langston : Got it. And then just to clarify, maybe on the RPT improvement, sounds like obviously you're still working through that, and some of that will annualize into 2025. Is it fair to assume that may end up just from a year-on-year, maybe closer to 3.5% to 4%? You're guiding this year as opposed to maybe the 2.5% to 3%? Javier Rodriguez : I'm sorry, are you asking about 2025 RPT? Ryan Langston : Yes, I'm asking if you're guiding to 3.5% to 4% this year, but some of it will annualize into next year. Is it fair that the growth rate might be higher, closer to 3.5% to 4% in 2025 versus maybe prior? We would have thought maybe closer to 2.5% to 3%? Javier Rodriguez : Yes. It's early for guidance, but I would not go to 3.5% to 4% for next year. I think that would be a real stretch to perform at this level for another year. Ryan Langston : Okay, thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys, just some quick follow ups here. What percent of your treatments were home treatments this quarter and what was your center liquidization this quarter and how to compare versus first quarter? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, home utilization is still running in the mid to high 15s. In terms of capacity utilization, we're somewhere between 58.5 and 59 somewhere right around that. Pito Chickering : Okay. And on the international business, the margin looks about 7% range, I guess. How do you think that evolves over the next couple of years? Javier Rodriguez : I think growth in international for the next couple of years, especially next year, is likely to be higher than it's been in the past, largely driven by the acquisition that we've done in Latin America. Pito Chickering : Sorry for the OI margins. Like the track. Around 7% [indiscernible], I guess. How does that evolve over time? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, I think it will continue to tick up. I don't have a view on could it ever get to the U.S. margins, but I would say that's highly unlikely. Pito Chickering : All right, last one, Frankie. Joel Ackerman : The margins internationally have a couple of dynamics. Number one, there is no such thing as international. There are 12 to 13 countries. And of course they weigh differently. And in some of these you have one payer, the government, and so they will go in periods where there's no increase and then they will have a lump increase and so it's got a little more unusual dynamics and harder to predict the margin. Pito Chickering : So then if margin is, I guess, harder, I guess, why is that a better use of cash flow than doing share repo? Joel Ackerman : Well, we're confident on the adjusted return, but you're asking a different question, which is are we seeing margin increases? Pito Chickering : Okay, fair enough. And the last one for IKC, you picked up about 3000 lives. This quarter was last quarter. But the medical spend per life is about half of what it was on the average the last quarter. So as you're bringing new patients on to IKC, you sort of talk about what type of patient dynamics they are versus who you have currently in there. Thanks so much. Javier Rodriguez : Yes. I would be cautious with that ratio of medical cost per life. A lot of the lives you're talking about there, their medical costs don't actually flow through our P&L. It's only the snippet lives where the medical costs flow through. So I probably wouldn't go there with that calculation. Pito Chickering : All right, fair enough. Thanks, guys. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Pito. Operator : And at this time, I'm no showing no further questions. Javier Rodriguez : Okay. Thank you, Michelle and thank you all for the questions. To conclude, it was another strong quarter for DaVita resulting from our investments in recent years to build a great team, strong systems, and enhance our capabilities as we look ahead while it's a little early to offer guidance, we believe that the underperformance, the underpinnings of our margins are sustainable. With this foundation, we're excited about the future we can achieve to benefit our patients, partners and teammates. Thank you for your continued interest in DaVita. And be well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Eliason, you may begin your conference. Nic Eliason : Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Nic Eliason, Group Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, all subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent filings that we make with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements, except as may be required by law. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release furnished to the SEC and available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Nic, and thank you all for joining the call today. I'm grateful for the incredible effort of our frontline caregivers as we deliver outstanding care for our patients while also navigating recent hurricanes and related supply disruption. Alongside these challenges, we continue to execute on operating efficiencies and innovate across the continuum of care. Today, I will cover our third quarter performance, which was in line with our expectations, provide an update on our supply chain, discuss our expectations for upcoming CMS 2025 final rule and wrap up with some comments about next year. But first, we will start the call as we always do with a clinical highlight. This quarter, we'll use this opportunity to highlight the remarkable resilience our patients and teammates have demonstrated in the face of recent storms. Over the past month, millions of lives were impacted by the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Despite hundreds of centers being in the path of these storms, most were open within days of the storm relenting and all but one is fully operational today, providing care in these communities. Many inspirational stories emerge from the dialysis community which came together to support those in need. In the immediate aftermath of these storms, our care teams from across the country rallied to support the regions affected. DaVita deployed generators, water tankers, over 20,000 gallons of fuel in high-water crews to conduct wellness checks and search for missing patients and teammates. Local leadership worked tirelessly to account for all patients and teammates and to coordinate transportation for urgent access to the dialysis care many patients needed to survive. Our Asheville Kidney Center opened on the Sunday immediately after Hurricane Helene, under generated power to provide the care for patients from six nearby facilities. We and others in the kidney care community open our doors to anyone needing treatment, including those who normally treat with other providers. I was proud to see the dialysis community come together in common support of patient care. Combined with the dedication of our local care teams, our successful emergency response has again underscored the importance of scaled resources and operating discipline. Although the storms have since passed, our efforts are ongoing to coordinate humanitarian needs, including food, housing and other assistance. We continue to work with the impacted communities to rebuild. Thank you all to the teammates who have gone above and beyond to care for one another and our patients. Beyond the community impact, key supply lines were disrupted by Hurricane Helene due to the closing of Baxter's North Cove facility. Baxter supplies us with the majority of our peritoneal dialysis or PD solution used for home PD therapy and the majority of our saline used during each in-center hemodialysis treatment. Baxter and other manufacturers have been able to provide sufficient supply for all our current PD patients to continue the treatment relatively uninterrupted. While we have had to temporarily suspend new patient starts on PD, thanks to the great efforts of our regulators, government officials and Baxter. We expect to resume new PD starts next month and we expect supply dynamics to normalize in the first quarter. Shifting to sailing, Baxter is now able to supply us with approximately 60% of their pre-storm levels as they continue their work to bring the North Cove facility back online. Fortunately, we've been successful in securing alternative supply to ensure continuity of care and safety for our patients. Because these challenges occurred near the end of the quarter, the impact on Q3 financial result was minimal. For the fourth quarter, we estimate an impact of approximately $10 million to $20 million due to the high supply costs, lower PD patient starts and lower productivity from our home caregivers. This is now included within our 2024 adjusted operating income guidance range and we expect portion of this quarterly impact will continue into 2025, depending on the duration of the supply challenges. I'll transition now to our expectations for the ESRD final rule from CMS, which we anticipate will be published shortly. While there are many aspects of the rule, we'll be primarily focused on two areas. First, the market basket update, including how CMS handles the new proposed wage index and the base rate. As a reminder, the proposed rule led to an approximate 2.1% increase. The second is the transition of oral-only drugs into the bundle beginning January 1. As a reminder, this is a statutory mandate by which oral-only drugs, which are mostly phosphate binders will transition from the Medicare drug benefit over to Medicare Part B. While CMS made clear it intends for these drugs to enter the bundle, we are waiting on information such as initial reimbursement and the treatment of unbillable items. We continue to believe this transition to the bundle will provide more patients with access to these important therapies. We recognize that some pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to advocate for the legislation to delay the implementation of this long-standing rule, but urge legislators to put patient access first. We're prepared to implement this transition in support of our patients. Transitioning to our third quarter performance, adjusted operating income was $535 million and adjusted earnings per share was $2.59. We view our third quarter results as fairly straightforward, consistent with how we have delivered value throughout this entire year. Although treatment volume growth remains a challenge, our business continues to demonstrate resilience as we mitigate the volume headwinds with margin expansion, including the momentum of our IKC and International results, all while continuing to invest in our future. Cash flow remains strong and we continue to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Turning to the full year. We remain on track to deliver results consistent with our 2024 guidance range. We're reconfirming our 2024 adjusted operating income guidance of $1.91 billion to $2.01 billion. This forecast now includes the impact of Baxter supply shortage. It is a bit early to give specific guidance for 2025, although I know that many of you are already looking ahead to next year. Over the next few months, we'll learn more key factors including open enrollment, oral drugs in the bundle, integrated kidney care, and others. So we will provide formal 2025 guidance on the fourth quarter call consistent with our normal cadence. That said, some multiyear context may be helpful. After challenging years in 2021 and 2022 during the pandemic, we're now on track to deliver our second consecutive year of double-digit adjusted OI growth despite continuing volume and labor pressures. Looking forward, we expect to return to adjusted OI growth more consistent with our historic pre-pandemic multi-year guidance. I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Joel Ackerman : Thank you, Javier. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was $535 million, adjusted EPS was $2.59 and free cash flow was $555 million. Let me start with some details behind the Q3 results. Quarter-over-quarter treatment volume per day was flat. This was in line with our expectations and is the result of continued strong admissions offset by elevated mortality and slightly higher mistreatment rates resulting from inclement weather, namely Hurricane Beryl in July and Hurricane Helene in September. We remain confident that our full-year treatment volume growth will fall in the range of 0.5% to 1%. Revenue per treatment was up more than $4 versus the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Our revenue cycle performance is sustaining the strong RPT results we've seen throughout the year. We still expect full-year RPT growth to be within the range of 3.5% to 4%. Patient care cost per treatment increased $2 sequentially. This was primarily the result of continued labor cost pressure plus higher medical benefits expense in the quarter. G&A costs increased by $19 million quarter-over-quarter due to typical quarterly variability in expense timing. Depreciation and amortization increased by $11 million in Q3 versus Q2 as a result of higher center closure costs. International OI increased slightly in the quarter as the result of strong operational performance offset by $4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Adjusted operating results within Integrated Kidney Care, our value-based care segment increased $32 million sequentially due to lower costs in our special needs plans and timing of revenue recognition related to CKCC, the government value-based care demonstration program. As always, we recommend evaluating IKC performance on an annual basis given the propensity for quarterly variability. We still believe IKC will have a full-year operating loss of approximately $50 million. Below the OI line, third quarter debt expense was $37 million higher than in Q2. This was due to two main factors. First, our 2% interest rate caps expired at the end of June and our current caps have a weighted average rate of approximately 4.3% for the rest of 2024. This impact is in line with our expectations and consistent with our guidance from the beginning of the year. The second factor contributing to the increase this quarter was the additional debt raised in August. Following our second-quarter earnings call, we successfully completed two debt transactions totaling $2.1 billion. The proceeds from these deals were used in part to repay our Term Loan B maturing in 2026, now making our nearest debt maturity 2028. Leverage at the end of Q3 was 3.17 times EBITDA, a slight increase from Q2, while remaining below the midpoint of our target range of 3 times to 3.5 times EBITDA. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares and we have repurchased approximately 600,000 shares to date in October. Let me close out with some comments on what remains of 2024 and our thoughts as we look towards 2025. As Javier said, we are reaffirming our adjusted OI guidance range of $1.91 billion to $2.01 billion. Despite the anticipated hurricane-related OI impact in the fourth quarter, we expect continuing operating momentum to offset the headwind. We are also maintaining our adjusted EPS range of $9.25 to $10.05 and our free cash flow range of $950 million to $1.2 billion. Looking forward to 2025, as Javier mentioned, it is too early to give formal guidance. Regarding some of the components of earnings, I would like to call out a few unique potential headwinds and tailwinds outside of our normal dynamics. For the headwinds, first, we expect mortality will remain elevated in 2025. Second, we expect the impact of the Baxter facility closure will continue in 2025. Third, the full-year impact of the expiration of our 2% interest rate caps will negatively impact EPS. For the tailwinds, first is the declining center closure costs in 2025 that we called out last quarter. Second is the positive OI impact from our international business driven by our Latin America acquisitions. And finally, we expect that the inclusion of orals in the bundle would be a tailwind if the pharma companies are unable to get legislation passed to delay the inclusion. Lastly, regarding RPT and PCC growth, we expect both to be elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. We will give an update on all these factors along with more quantitative guidance on the Q4 earnings call. That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Andrew Mok with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Andrew Mok : Hi, good afternoon. It sounded like there was a fair amount of operational changes to help navigate the hurricanes, but most of that would be felt in Q4. So wanted to better understand, one, how much of an impact hurricanes had on 3Q treatment volumes, if any? And then Joel, I think I heard you reiterate full-year treatment growth between 50 basis points to 100 basis points of growth, which would imply a fairly significant acceleration in 4Q against the presumably greater impact from hurricanes. So I just wanted to understand how we should think through that and square those comments. Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Yes, thanks, Andrew. So for Q3, I'd call out the impact from hurricanes as about 10 basis points and that shows up in mistreatment rate. In Q4, I don't think this does much to change how we were thinking about Q4 before hurricanes. Andrew Mok : So Q4 -- so the hurricanes aren't expected to have an impact on Q4 volumes? Joel Ackerman : Less -- significantly less than the 10 basis points from what we've seen so far. The quarter is not over, obviously, so there could be additional challenges. But so far, no, it would be less than the 10 basis points. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. And then appreciate the early comments on 2025 headwinds and tailwinds. Can you help us understand the order of magnitude of some of those? And hoping specifically you could comment on the potential financial impact of the inclusion of phosphate binders that could have on next year's results. Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : Well, let me start with the end on that on the phosphate binders because we really tried quite a lot to give you a useful range. And unfortunately, we can't and it's just because there's not enough information to give you a useful number. So let me just give you an explanation of the underlying dynamics, so everybody can be on the same page. So first of all, there is a class of drugs, phosphate binders that will be the biggest part of the orals in the bundle. The first thing is we do not know because the rule hasn't come out, although we expect to hear shortly what the reimbursement will be by the government. Secondly, there are four products within the phosphate binders and we don't know the mix of those products. And the pricing is quite different between those four products between branded and generic. And within that, the branded have had restrictions and authorizations and other things that once those go away, we don't know what's going to happen with the mix. And then the last thing is the volume. There's about 10% to 15% of our patients that don't have Medicare Part D and weren't participating in these orals in the bundle and that's why we think that this is so good for access for those patients. And so, we don't know what will happen with that volume. So, if you start to play with the variables, they start to get quite wide because, in essence, the volume could tighten up, but then the reimbursement has a wide range. And then the one that really throws a lot of dynamics into it is the pricing and the mix within that pricing. So unfortunately, we're going to have to wait till next quarter to give you a better number, better sense of that. Joel Ackerman : Yes. And Andrew, to follow up on the first part of your question. So I called out five factors, three tailwinds, two headwinds that would impact operating income. There was one additional, the interest expense, but that only hits EPS. Like the orals in the bundle, it is hard, there's a lot of swing factors that could apply to each of these. So I'm not going to quantify them individually. That said, I think a reasonable starting point for modeling would be that the headwinds and the tailwinds will offset each other at the OI line. Andrew Mok : Got it. So when we think about the referenced target growth, which I think is 3% to 7% pre-COVID, that's inclusive of all those headwinds and tailwinds. That's how we should think about it? Joel Ackerman : I think that's -- yes, I think that's right. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is AJ Rice with UBS. You may go ahead. AJ Rice : Thanks. Hi, everybody. I think I know the answer to this point of clarification, but I'll just make sure to get on the record. The $10 million to $20 million of hurricane impact that -- I assume, that's EBITDA, not revenue. And then maybe just more broadly on the treatment patterns. I know last quarter you said that new to therapy was back to pre-pandemic levels. It sounds like it was positive again this quarter. I just want to -- is there any -- is it stronger or is it about the same? And then the elevated mistreatments, is that strictly the hurricane impact or is there anything else going on there? And then, on mortality, it sounds like you're now extending that into 2025. Is that just because this is the first time you're commenting on '25? Or is there something new that's making you call out '25 on the mortality -- heightened mortality rates? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So let me try and get these in order. So first, in terms of the Baxter impact in Q4, it would be largely in EBITDA. There'd be -- there's the potential for a little bit in the revenue line if we lose some patience to another provider that's able to provide peritoneal dialysis and a patient for whatever reason chooses to go that direction. But I would say the vast majority of it will be -- will not be revenue. On the three factors affecting volume, nothing new on admits. It's running consistent with what we've talked about in the past. Mistreatment rate is --it's never just storms, right? Historically, it's always been somewhere around 6% on average during the year, although not the same quarter to quarter Q1 and Q4 tend to be elevated and Q2 and Q3 less so. So the 10 bps from the storms was kind of the 10 bps more than what we probably otherwise would have expected. But it's not the total mistreatment rate. And then on mortality, I don't think there's anything new here that negatively impacts our view of 2025. I think the fact that the elevated mortality continues and hasn't gone back to pre-COVD levels. Every quarter that that happens, it informs our views a bit. But I don't think we saw anything over this quarter that changed our views for next year significantly. AJ Rice : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon. So back on that non-acquired treatment growth number here. There's obviously a lot of focus here. Can you quantify the number of new patients you added in the first quarter, second quarter and third quarter? Any color on how many you lost to transplants sort of this year? Any color on those patients moving to other centers or geographies? I'm just looking for any other reasons besides mortality as I'm trying to tie out the treatment growth they get, they're looking at showing with a delayed USRDS quarterly data on incidence and prevalence. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you, Pito. Let me just grab it at the high level because there is sort of, let's call it, a restless energy of trying to figure out what's happening with volume. But the reality is that it's just as straightforward as elevated mortality. That when you look at the admit growth, it is healthy. When you look at the mix, it is healthy. When you look at transplants, they are constant. It moves a little, but it doesn't really move the needle at all. It goes up and down bit. Our share of transplants has continued to be constant. So at the end of the day, we could have mistreatments move a little here and there because of storms or other things that are seasonal, but the bulk of it is elevated mortality. Joel Ackerman : Yes -- and let me just\u2026 Pito Chickering : Sorry, go ahead. Joel Ackerman : Let me just pop on to the first question was about the NAG in the quarter and let me just give you a little bit on that. Quarterly NAG has some volatility in it. If you're trying to do what I think you're trying to do, which is trying to piece out the volume trends which we're all trying to figure out. I don't think looking at quarter-over-quarter NAG is a great number for that. Within that number is factors including this treatment rate a lot about timing of census during the quarter. So it's down 60 bps quarter over quarter. I don't think that says anything material about where the volume overall is trending. Pito Chickering : Okay, fair enough. Sort of follow-up here on IKC. Usually you true up with your payers during the third quarter. Pairs have had a lot of -- we'll say slightly volatility this quarter. Just curious how that true-up went with the payers for 2023 during the third quarter. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So we are on track for the year. I would say, I would encourage you and everyone as we always have, let's look at IKC on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis. We're reaffirming our negative $50 million for the year which was -- has been our number all year long. And I would say the volatility that we read about in the payer market largely has not impacted us. Pito Chickering : Okay. But then don't you guys do your big annual true-ups from the previous year during the third quarter? Is that the -- Joel Ackerman : We do them in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and they're going as planned. Pito Chickering : Okay. Okay, fair enough. Okay. And then last question here. Just looking at commercial and MA price increases for '25 or needs tracking in line with historical levels. Thank you so much. Javier Rodriguez : Yes, there's nothing interesting to call out. Going as expected. Pito Chickering : Great, thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Lisa Clive with Bernstein. Lisa Clive : Hi. Just on volume growth, given the continued decline, how should we think about volume growth for the year? I think previously you were at 0.5% to 1%. And any thoughts into 2025. And also, in IKC, can you give us any indication in terms of how your reimbursement is split between capitated shared savings? That would be helpful. Thanks. Joel Ackerman : Yes, starting on the volume, for 2024, we're still thinking 50 bps to 100 bps of growth. So no change there. On the IKC thing, I think we'll have to get back to you on that one. Did I miss a question, Lisa? Lisa Clive : No, no. I was just -- yes, I mean, I think just trying to think through the potential growth of IKC, both on the top line and revenue, just -- it would be helpful at some point to get some indication of how the economics work in there. Thanks. But I'll wait for you to get back on that. Joel Ackerman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next caller is Joanna Gajuk of Bank of America. You may go ahead. Joanna Gajuk : Hi, thank you so much for taking the question here. So I guess I just follow up on the last question here around volumes, right? So you expect to still grow slightly for the year? And then how should we think about, I guess, next year and your kind of ultimate target of growing 2% on volumes same-store? Joel Ackerman : Yes. So for next year, as Javier mentioned, it's pretty -- most of the story is about mortality and what happens to mortality next year. To put a little bit more color on that, I would say, if you take the middle of our range for this year of 75 basis points of growth, if you want to think about how to model next year, there is a slight headwind on treatment days for next year, about 25 basis points. And then there's one headwind and one tailwind. The headwind would be associated with clinic closures. We called that out last quarter as a source of headwind on volume for the year. And as the clinic closures come further into the background, further into our history, then I think we'll see a little bit of tailwind of that. And then we could also potentially have a headwind next year associated with PD and the Baxter issue that we're having and that's pretty simple. There are some patients who might want to start PD now. We don't have the ability to start all of the new PD patients over the quarter, and they might go to another provider. I would call those two things, the clinic closures and the Baxter PD as offsetting. So you really have next year, starting with a base of this year 75 basis points, less 25 basis points of day mix. And so you start with a base of 50 basis points. And then getting back to what Javier said, it's up to everyone to figure out what they think will happen to mortality next year versus this year. And then obviously mistreatment rate can also be another source of variability from one year to the next. So that's the framework I would lay out for how to think about it. Joanna Gajuk : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for flying in the day\u2019s impact. But if I may -- I have another question, but before I go there, just follow up on the PD patients. So I guess, yes, what's your home dialysis mix? And then inside that, what's the PD versus HD home? Javier Rodriguez : So our mix in PD hasn't changed because it happened by the end of the quarter and that's in the mid 15 is the range. HHD is like a 2% or so mix. And I would take this moment just to thank Baxter and the government. They've been amazing, working literally around the clock to make sure that all of our patients get their supply. And so, as we look at what they've told us, we will obviously see a little deterioration in that through the fourth quarter, but we will normalize by the first quarter and try to get all our patients back on track. Joel Ackerman : Yes. And the one thing I'd add, Joanna, is of those PD patients, remember, we expect to keep the vast majority of them. The new patients, many of them, about half of them are already dialyzing in our clinics and we think it won't be too much of an inconvenience for them to wait a little bit before they move to PD. Those new to dialysis patients who are going to go on PD have options, including postponing dialysis, assuming they have residual renal function, they could go in center and then transition to PD. And then there could be some who decide that they don't want to wait and will go to another provider. So what we would expect you to see is a decline, a potentially significant decline in our home mix over the next quarter, but the number of patients that actually leave DaVita or don't join DaVita, we don't think will be that high. Joanna Gajuk : Okay. That's super helpful. If I may, another question I had on next year's outlook. I guess following up on your comment around, you expect the RPT growth next year to be still elevated. So are you kind of implying 3% to -- 3.5% to 4% that you're guiding for this year is the number to think for next year or is it a little bit less, a little bit more? How to think about it? Thank you. Joel Ackerman : It's too early to guide quantitatively, but I would think lower than that. Joanna Gajuk : Okay, so slightly lower than 3.5% to 4%, but you're saying higher than like your historical range? Joel Ackerman : Yes. Joanna Gajuk : Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Javier Rodriguez : Hey, Joanna, this is Javier. Just to clarify the comment I said because I don't think I was clear as I should have been. 15.5% is our mix of home patients total, of which 2% are HHD and 13% in change are PD. I don't think that, that was correct. Joanna Gajuk : Okay. 13% is PD. Okay, great. Thank you. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next caller is Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. You may go ahead, sir. Ryan Langston : Hi, thank you. In the release, I think it said that 3Q advocacy costs had increased. But I think in the second quarter, those were down year-over-year. Can you just kind of give us a sense on what those are related to? Javier Rodriguez : We've got several things going on through the advocacy costs, but a couple of the main drivers are California and the elections there. And then, of course, what we're doing with the restore of the patients in Washington, D.C. And then the last one would be the orals in the bundle because as you might have heard, there's some campaigns from pharmaceutical companies that are trying to delay orals in the bundle. And so, we're having to mobilize our resources in Washington, D.C. to make sure people are educated as to the good that orals in the bundle can do. Ryan Langston : Got it. And then just last for me. I think on mistreatment second quarter in a row just elevated from weather, assuming we don't have any more, I guess, hurricanes, other weather events, et cetera, would we expect those to revert back to sort of normalized historical levels? Thanks. Joel Ackerman : So they're still -- mistreatment rate is still running elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. So I think without additional storms, we would expect them to continue to tick down over time. The pace of that is to be determined. That said, remember, they do go up seasonally in Q4. So, with -- even without additional storms, you'd expect mistreatment rate to be up in Q4. Ryan Langston : Got it. Appreciate the help. Thank you. Joel Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good evening. First question, just going back to your headwinds and tailwinds. I didn't hear you mention RPT annualizing the strength of 2024 annualizing next year. Just my numbers, I have you going from 2.5% to 3% to 3.5% before, right? So you guided up by 1%. A lot of that ramps in the second half of the year. So I would have thought the annualization of that strong second-half '24 growth would be a pretty good tailwind to 2025. Any comment on that? Am I missing something? Joel Ackerman : Yes, Justin, your math is all right and we stand by our comments. We had a lot of debates, as you can imagine about what to call out as unique headwinds and tailwinds versus non-unique headwinds and tailwinds. So I think we stand by that and that's why we called out RPT is going to be higher than normal next year. We just chose not to put it in the bucket of headwinds and tailwinds we called out. Justin Lake : Okay. And I'll take that offline. Then the $135 million of interest expense, is this a good run rate or does it potentially migrate higher into 2025? Joel Ackerman : No, I think it's a good run rate. Our caps for next year are actually slightly lower than our caps for this year. So that could work. Just to be clear, the $135 million is the uptick for next year. So I think you should think about this as $270 million for the year. Oh, hold on one second. My team is looking at me. Let me come back to you in a second, Justin. Justin Lake : Sure, sure. To be clear, I wasn't talking about the year-over-year. I was just talking about the -- Joel Ackerman : I'm sorry, the $135 million for the quarter, that is a reasonably good number. For next year, it could come down as a quarterly number because our caps are a little bit lower. But if you think of the two things that are driving the number up, it's more debt, which I wouldn't expect us to incur more debt over the next few quarters and then our caps aren't going to change materially. Justin Lake : Okay. Do those caps expire or are they kind of at a reasonable rate? Like, you could re-up them right now? If they expired at the end of next year and interest rates didn't change, you'd be fine. Joel Ackerman : Yes. So we changed the way we do it. We have about a -- we have a cliff -- we had a cliff at the end of Q2 because we used to do a three-year or four-year cap. Now we do it rolling. So going forward, you wouldn't see a big change like this. It'll gradually move up and down depending on where interest rates are when the caps are put in place. Justin Lake : Perfect. And then lastly, just apologize if I missed this, but did you give a mix number for the quarter versus, I think, the 11% you talked about last quarter commercial mix? Joel Ackerman : Yes, there was really nothing material changes in the mix for any of our usual mix numbers. Justin Lake : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Andrew Mok with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Andrew Mok : Hi, thanks. Thanks for letting me back in. I just wanted to follow up on G&A. It looks like that was up 7% sequentially and 10% year over year. What were the drivers of that in the quarter? Javier Rodriguez : Yes, in G&A, we have a lot going on because we're trying to really go through the entire continuum of care and unite it, all the transitions of care. But the big bulk of it is going into IT is going in. And the second part is, of course, you've got wages in there. And the third part would be the reimbursement operations investment that rendered the increase in revenue per treatment. So those are the explain the vast majority of the increase. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. And then maybe on the follow-up to the commercial mix. How much is the ACA exchange mix within the commercial mix within that, 11%? And how much growth are you seeing on the ACA exchanges this year? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : So just to make sure I've got the right language, I think on the QHPs. So, on the QHPs, the country's running around 7% to 8% mix and our population is running around 3% mix. And so we're underrepresented because in QHPs, if one of our patients picks Medicare, they are out of the QHP. So that's why we're underrepresented. Andrew Mok : Got it. And can you give us a sense of how much growth you've seen in that payer class? Thanks. Javier Rodriguez : We're growing exactly as the market grows. So that has been literally the lines are on top of each other. Andrew Mok : All right. Thanks for all the color. Javier Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys. It's a quick follow-up here for 2025. Will depreciation be another tailwind for next year? Joel Ackerman : I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Pito, can you say that again? Pito Chickering : Yes, you bet. Will depreciation be another tailwind for next year EPS? Joel Ackerman : It'll be flat to down. Well, the answer is yes. Part of it comes from the center closure number coming down, but excluding that, it'll be flat to down. Pito Chickering : Okay. So, doing just some quick back-of-envelope math, mortality I get -- on the lack of a PD, that hurts. But Baxter's ramping up their facilities pretty rapidly. So that's pretty much solved in the first -- part of the first quarter. The Justin's questions on interest rates caps, that's just math. In center closures, international, that's again just math. Depending upon where the bundle goes, when you put together the headwinds and tailwinds, depending upon the bundle, isn't this a possibility this will be more of a tailwind than headwind? But we just want to see where the bundle ends up. Is that a fair way of think of thinking about this? Joel Ackerman : I'm -- Just help me again with the end of the question, Pito. What specifically are asking if it's a headwind or tailwind? The bundle? Pito Chickering : Yes. So the tailwinds seem -- just putting the math together on the headwinds, understand those and understand the math of the tailwinds. The biggest variable here seems to be with the bundles. And so depending upon... Joel Ackerman : Got it. Okay. Pito Chickering : And depending upon where the bundle goes, that will define whether the headwinds or tailwinds are a tailwind versus a -- maybe your commentary about a push. If depending upon the pricing we got soon, this could be, I guess, more favorable, depending upon what the government says in a week or two. Is that a fair way of thinking about it? Joel Ackerman : I think there's probably a little bit more variability in a bunch of these lines than you're giving credit to. So, orals could be better, it could be worse. But all of these probably have a decent amount of play in them. So I think it go -- could go either way, a net headwind or a net tailwind. Pito Chickering : Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to you for closing comments. Javier Rodriguez : Okay, thank you, Michelle. And thank you all for your interest in DaVita. We'll end the call where we started with appreciation for the hard work of our DaVita Care teams on behalf of our patients. Although we will incur some additional expenses related to recent storms, we except to -- we expect to absorb these costs within the continued strong performance of our underlying business. We've covered a lot on volume and as we said, while mortality remains elevated, our investments in people and infrastructure and capabilities has returned our operating income to the pre-pandemic trajectory. Thank you for your continued interest and be well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead\u2026",
